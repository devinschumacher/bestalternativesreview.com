## Buyer's Guide

Sunpan furniture combines style and durability through their authentic teak wood and hand-woven rattan collections. When selecting pieces, consider the furniture's craftsmanship, material quality, and whether it matches your desired aesthetic.

High-quality Sunpan furniture features detailed craftsmanship with proper jointing and sturdy construction. Look for tight-weave patterns in the rattan and straight, consistent lines in the wood pieces. The furniture should feel solid without excessive weight, indicating proper material thickness.

### Material Durability

Authentic teak wood resists rot and warping, making it ideal for outdoor furniture. The wood should have a natural golden hue with distinct grain patterns.
