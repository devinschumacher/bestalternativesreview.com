## FAQ


### What is bob wig human hair?

Bob wig human hair refers to hair extensions or bob wigs made from human hair strands. These extensions are crafted using natural hair from human donors, providing a realistic look and feel compared to synthetic alternatives. 

Human hair bob wigs offer various advantages, including natural shine, compatibility with different hair types, and improved styling versatility. They require special care, such as regular conditioning and proper storage, to maintain their quality and appearance. 


### How durable are human hair bob wigs?

Human hair bob wigs can be quite durable with proper care. The longevity depends on several factors including the quality of the hair used, the craftsmanship of the wig, and how well it's maintained. 

With regular grooming, protection from harsh elements, and timely replacement of damaged hair, high-quality human hair bob wigs can last anywhere from 1 to 3 years, equivalent to 6-24 normal hair cycles. 


### Can human hair bob wigs be dyed?

Yes, human hair bob wigs can be safely dyed with the appropriate hair coloring products. It's important to use color-safe shampoos and conditioners specifically designed for human hair extensions. 

Before dyeing, it's recommended to consult with a professional wig stylist to ensure the dye process goes smoothly and the color lasts longer. 


### What maintenance is required for human hair bob wigs?

Regular maintenance is essential to keep human hair bob wigs in good condition. This includes washing the wig every 1-2 weeks with mild shampoo and cold water, followed by thorough drying. 

Between washes, misting the wig with a soft hair mist can help maintain its shape and appearance. It's also important to regularly condition the hair and detangle it gently to prevent damage. 


### How do I keep human hair bob wigs clean?

Clean your human hair bob wig weekly with a gentle shampoo and cool water. Rinse thoroughly to remove all traces of shampoo, then gently squeeze out excess water. Avoid rubbing or twisting the wig, as this can cause tangling and damage. 

After washing, allow the wig to air dry completely before storing it in a protective bag or wig stand. This helps prevent tangling and keeps the hair straight. 


### Can chemical relaxers be used on human hair bob wigs?

No, chemical relaxers should never be used on human hair bob wigs. Relaxers contain harsh chemicals that can damage the natural hair strands and potentially destroy the wig. 

For managing curly hair, consider using heated styling tools with low heat settings or natural methods like stretching and combing. Always consult with a professional before attempting any significant hair modifications on a human hair wig.
