## Buyer's Guide

Homedics air purifiers help improve indoor air quality by filtering out dust, pollen, and other airborne particles. Understanding their features and capabilities can help you choose the right purifier for your home. 


### Filter Technology

Most Homedics air purifiers use HEPA filters, which capture at least 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns. Some models include activated carbon filters for additional odor and chemical filtration. Consider the type and number of filters needed for your specific needs. 


### Coverage Area

The purifier's CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate) rating indicates how effectively it cleans the air in a room. For residential use, expect CADR ratings between 180 and 450 cubic feet per minute (CFM). Calculate your room's volume to determine the appropriate CADR for your space. 


### Power Consumption

Look for models with ENERGY STAR certification for energy efficiency. Compare wattage to CADR ratings to find the best balance of performance and power consumption. Consider using the purifier during specific hours or when you're home to save electricity. 


### Portability and Size

Select a purifier with a compact footprint if you need to move it between rooms. Wheels and handles make transport easier. The tower or upright design affects placement flexibility and visibility of the filter indicator light. 


## FAQ


### Do Homedics air purifiers remove viruses and bacteria?

Yes, Homedics air purifiers contain activated carbon filters that help remove odors, smoke, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). While the primary filter type (HEPA or True HEPA) effectively captures particles like dust, pollen, and pet dander, the activated carbon helps address biological contaminants. For comprehensive virus and bacteria removal, Homedics models with additional UV-C technology or specialized antimicrobial filters are recommended. 

Independent testing has shown that these purifiers reduce particle sizes as small as 0.1 microns, which covers many common airborne pathogens. However, the effectiveness against specific microorganisms can vary based on the model and its additional filtration features. 


### How long do Homedics air purifier filters last?

The recommended filter replacement schedule for Homedics air purifiers depends on the model and usage. For most models, the primary filter (HEPA or True HEPA) should be replaced every 6-12 months, while the activated carbon filter needs replacement every 3-6 months. These timelines account for an average household of 2-4 people in a 120-400 square foot room. 

If you live in a dusty environment or have pets, you may need to replace the filters more frequently. Regular filter replacement ensures optimal air purification and maintains the unit's efficiency over time. 


### Are Homedics air purifiers suitable for pets?

Yes, Homedics air purifiers are particularly effective at reducing pet-related allergens and odors. The HEPA filter captures pet dander, while activated carbon targets pet-related odors and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Most models also include a pre-filter that traps larger particles, helping to reduce shedding and airborne allergens. 

While the basic models are effective, consider models with additional features like activated carbon for odor control and UV-C technology for enhanced microbial filtration if you have severe pet-related allergies or concerns about airborne pathogens. 


### Does the Homedics air purifier have a sleep mode?

Yes, most Homedics air purifiers feature a sleep mode that reduces fan speed and noise levels for quiet operation during nighttime use. This mode typically runs at a lower fan speed and mutes the indicator lights, making it ideal for use during sleep or quiet times in the home. 

Some models also include a sleep timer that allows you to set the purifier to automatically switch to sleep mode after a specified period, usually ranging from 2 to 24 hours. 


### What is the noise level of Homedics air purifiers?

Most Homedics air purifiers operate at noise levels between 25-45 decibels, which is generally considered quiet enough for most residential environments. The base models typically range between 25-30 decibels at the lowest fan speed, while the advanced models with multiple fan speeds can reach up to 45 decibels at maximum settings. 

The noise level can vary based on the specific model and fan speed setting. For example, the basic models often maintain under 30 decibels even at the highest setting, while some advanced models may require the lowest speed to achieve quiet operation during the night. 


### How do I know which Homedics air purifier model is right for my room size?

Homedics air purifiers are generally designed to clean 120-400 square feet of living space, depending on the model. To determine the appropriate size, multiply the room's length by its width to get the square footage. The most common models cover 120-200 square feet, while larger models handle up to 400 square feet. 

For optimal performance, it's recommended to select a model that slightly exceeds the room size to ensure consistent air quality. Ceiling heights of 8 feet or less are considered standard, while models that perform well in rooms with higher ceilings are typically noted in the product descriptions and specifications.
