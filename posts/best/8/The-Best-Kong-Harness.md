## Buyer's Guide

A Kong harness is a specialized dog harness that combines comfort and safety features, often incorporating a unique design that distributes pressure away from the neck and chest. This guide outlines key considerations to help you select the right Kong harness for your pet. 


### Size Selection

Proper fit is crucial when choosing a Kong harness. The harness should sit comfortably on your dog's body with enough room for movement but without slipping. Check the sizing chart provided by the manufacturer and measure your dog according to the recommended method (usually neck circumference and body length). 

Always opt for the smaller size if there's any doubt, as Kong harnesses typically stretch more than comparable models. 


### Material Quality

The durability and comfort of a Kong harness depend significantly on the materials used. Look for reinforced stitching, high-quality webbing or canvas construction, and breathable mesh panels where appropriate. 

For active dogs or those who pull while walking, harnesses with reinforced D-rings and thicker webbing in these areas are advisable. 


### Support and Comfort Features

Well-designed Kong harnesses distribute pressure across the dog's body rather than concentrating it on the neck. Look for features like a wide, padded chest strap, which should sit just behind the front legs, and a neck clip that prevents the harness from slipping forward during active play or walking. 

Soft, padded shoulder straps can also enhance comfort, particularly for breeds with thicker necks or those prone to pressure sores. 


### Adjustability and Safety Checks

Most Kong harnesses offer multiple adjustment points for precise fitting and stability. Ensure that the chest strap can be tightened enough to prevent twisting and that the neck clip is secure but not overly tight. 

Before each use, check all straps for signs of wear and ensure that buckles work smoothly without catching on clothing or hair. Regularly inspect the stitching for damage, especially around stress points like the chest and neck. 


## FAQ


### What differentiates Kong Harnesses from other dog harnesses?

Kong harnesses stand out for their innovative design that provides gentle control while preventing choke-strap pressure. The harness's flat design allows for natural shoulder movement and prevents rubbing, making it ideal for both everyday use and training. 

The materials used in Kong harnesses are specifically designed to be comfortable, with padded neck and chest areas that distribute pressure evenly. This attention to detail helps prevent irritation common with some other harness styles. 


### Can Kong Harnesses be used for pulling or tugging on leash?

Kong harnesses are designed with a D-ring at the dog's shoulder blades specifically intended for controlling pulling and tugging. When used correctly, they enable effective leash correction without strain on the neck. 

However, these harnesses are not recommended for formal training or competition where specific commands are needed. They excel in situations where gentle but consistent control is required. 


### What sizes are available for Kong Harnesses?

Kong harnesses come in multiple sizes to accommodate dogs from 5 to 150 pounds. The sizing chart clearly indicates each size's weight range and chest measurement, helping you select the right fit. 

Each harness also includes adjustable straps for the chest and belly, allowing fine-tuning to ensure a comfortable, secure fit without being too tight. 


### Are Kong Harnesses suitable for everyday wear?

Yes, Kong harnesses are designed for regular use and can be worn daily. Their breathable, lightweight construction makes them suitable for various weather conditions and activities. 

Regularly check the fit to ensure the harness remains secure but not tight. As with any harness, it's important to ensure the dog can move naturally without restriction. 


### What materials are Kong Harnesses made from?

These harnesses are constructed from a blend of soft polyester and TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane) materials that combine flexibility with durability. The raised padding areas are made from thicker TPU for additional comfort. 

The leash attachment points feature vulcanized rubber for longevity and security, while reflective elements enhance visibility during evening walks. 


### How long do Kong Harnesses typically last?

Regular inspection is recommended every few months to ensure all components remain in good condition. Replace the harness if you notice any signs of wear or damage.
