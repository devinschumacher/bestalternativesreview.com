Made from 100% organic cotton, these Hanes hipsters offer a gentle touch that's free from harsh chemicals. The flat-seam design and ComfortSoft cotton waistband provide a smooth feel against your skin without the irritation some find with tight elastic. While the organic material is lovely and breathable, expect some shrinkage in the first wash, so consider sizing up if you want your panties to keep their shape. 


## Buyer's Guide

Hanes women's underwear offers a wide range of styles, from everyday basics to athletic options. When selecting Hanes underwear, consider factors like construction quality, moisture management, and size accuracy to find the right fit and features for your needs. 


### Construction Quality

Look for underwear made from durable materials like cotton or blend fabrics that resist pilling and maintain their shape. The tag should indicate the fabric content, with higher percentage cotton generally lasting longer. 

Check the stitching quality by examining the seams. Well-made underwear will have straight, secure stitching without loose threads. The elastic should be even and comfortable, without bunching or irritation. 


### Moisture Management

For everyday wear, opt for cotton or cotton-blend options that allow air circulation and prevent moisture buildup. Athletic styles often feature moisture-wicking fabrics that pull sweat away from the body. 

Consider moisture barriers for more protection, especially in colder months. These layers prevent cold air from reaching your skin and reduce fabric cling when wearing multiple layers. 


### Size Accuracy

Hanes uses standard sizing charts, but measurements can vary slightly between styles. Take precise body measurements using a tape measure and compare them to the size chart provided by the manufacturer. 

Try on underwear in-store if possible to ensure proper fit. Pay attention to how the waistband sits around your natural waist and whether the legs sit evenly on your hips. Proper fit prevents discomfort and improved hygiene. 


### Style and Fit Considerations

Underwear styles range from classic briefs to boxer briefs and women's-specific styles like thongs. Consider your personal preference and how the style affects your movement and comfort. 

Waistband height options include mid-rise, high-rise, and ultra-high-rise. Choose based on your preference for coverage and how the style looks under clothing. 


## FAQ


### Sizing and Fit

Hanes women's underwear sizing runs true to size. The most important measurement is your fullest bust circumference, taken just under your arms and keeping the tape parallel to the floor. The measured size should align with the manufacturer's size chart for the specific style you're considering. 

Most Hanes styles offer similar measurements across their sizes, but it's always best to check the individual product's size chart. The brand typically offers true-to-size options in their standard ranges, from petite to plus sizes. 


### Materials and Quality

Hanes women's underwear uses primarily cotton for basics, which is soft and breathable while providing decent moisture-wicking properties. Their performance fabrics blend cotton with elasticity for better stretch and recovery. 

While Hanes is known for value pricing, their quality standards remain consistent across their product line. The cotton used is typically mid-range in quality compared to premium brands, making their underwear suitable for daily wear within their price point. 


### Care and Maintenance

Care instructions vary by style, but most Hanes women's underwear can be machine washed in cold water on a gentle cycle. Many styles can be tumble-dried, while others may need air drying. Always check the specific product's care label for the most accurate instructions. 

Regular care maintenance tips include washing bright colors separately, not mixing darks and lights, and using mild detergent. Hanes recommends avoiding fabric softeners for their underwear as they can reduce the fabric's elasticity. 


### Legroom and Comfort Features

Most Hanes women's underwear styles offer adequate legroom, with their high-rise styles typically featuring slightly deeper leg openings. They often incorporate moisture-wicking and breathable materials to enhance comfort during daily wear. 

Some styles include padding for added comfort and shape, while others feature seamless construction to prevent irritation. The most comfortable options often combine good moisture management with moderate compression. 


### Essential Styles

The most practical styles typically combine moisture-wicking, breathability, and basic performance features. Essential purchases might include high-waisted briefs, mid-rise panties, and a few pairs of moisture-wicking athletic shorts for working out. 

Consider the three most versatile styles â€“ high-waisted briefs, mid-rise cotton panties, and athletic moisture-wicking shorts â€“ as your core wardrobe staples. These styles offer the most comfort and functionality for daily wear. 


### Product Range

Hanes women's underwear range from basic cotton briefs and panties to moisture-wicking athletic styles. Their most popular categories include everyday cotton underwear, high-waisted styles, and athletic options for working out. 

While their selection covers most women's underwear needs, they offer fewer specialized styles than brands like Spanx or Wolfram Rich. For advanced compression or technical fabrics, you might want to consider other options, though Hanes still offers a comprehensive range suitable for most women.
