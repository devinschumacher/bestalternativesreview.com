## Buyer's Guide

A quality under cabinet coffee maker can transform your kitchen counter space while providing convenient morning brew options. These compact appliances require careful consideration of size, style, and brewing capabilities to find the perfect fit for your space and needs. 


### Size and Space Considerations

Measure your cabinet depth and width to ensure the coffee maker fits properly. Standard sizes range from 12 to 15 inches wide and 12 to 14 inches deep. Consider models with adjustable drip trays for better space utilization. Compact and travel-friendly options are available for smaller spaces or RVs. 


### Brewing Options and Capacity

Most under cabinet coffee makers offer either 8- or 10-cup capacities. Some models feature French press, pour-over, or single-serve brewing methods. Look for machines with keep-warm functionality and programmable timers for morning brewing convenience. 


### Design and Installation

Select a coffee maker with matching cabinet color options, such as brushed stainless steel or black finish, to maintain uniform aesthetics. Check if the model requires permanent installation or if it's available as a countertop model. Confirm the drip tray compatibility with your cabinet's layout and any existing plumbing. 


### Maintenance and Cleaning

Choose a coffee maker with easy-to-clean components, including a detachable brew basket and drip tray. Look for models with removable brewing units for thorough cleaning. Consider machines that automatically shut off to prevent phantom power consumption and feature energy-saving modes. 


## FAQ


### What is an under cabinet coffee maker?

Under cabinet coffee makers are compact appliances designed to fit beneath standard kitchen cabinets, providing a convenient way to brew coffee while maximizing counter space. These appliances are available in various sizes and styles, from single-cup brewers to multi-cup thermal carafes. 

Most under cabinet coffee makers feature drip brewing, travel mug warming, and programmable settings. They typically require minimal counter space (12-15 inches wide) and come with features like automatic shut-off and keep-warm settings for fresh coffee throughout the day. 


### How do under cabinet coffee makers compare to countertop models?

Under cabinet coffee makers offer significant space-saving benefits compared to traditional countertop models, which typically require 24 to 36 inches of counter space. Their smaller footprint makes them ideal for kitchens with limited counter real estate, such as apartments or smaller homes. 

While under cabinet coffee makers generally brew less coffee than countertop models (usually 4-12 cups), many include features like travel mug warming and thermal carafes to maintain coffee temperature. Countertop models usually offer more advanced brewing methods like espresso, pods, or French press. 


### What are the main features to consider when choosing an under cabinet coffee maker?

The primary features to consider include brewing capacity (number of cups), water reservoir size, brew strength options, and additional features like travel mug warming, keep-warm settings, and programmability. Look for intuitive controls, dishwasher-safe parts, and easy-to-clean designs. 

Energy efficiency, noise levels during brewing, and maintenance requirements are also important factors. Consider the material of the brew carafe and the brewing method (drip, pod, or French press) to find the right balance of convenience and functionality for your needs. 


### Are under cabinet coffee makers suitable for daily use?

Yes, under cabinet coffee makers are perfectly suited for daily use, particularly in small kitchens where counter space is at a premium. Their compact design and efficient brewing cycle make them ideal for morning routines, allowing you to start your day with freshly brewed coffee in just a few minutes. 

Most models feature automatic shut-off and keep-warm settings to maintain coffee temperature, ensuring your morning brew stays hot without constant supervision. The convenience of brewing directly at the sink or counter makes them particularly practical for daily use. 


### How much counter space do under cabinet coffee makers need?

Most under cabinet coffee makers require between 12 to 15 inches of counter space, which is typically the width of a standard kitchen cabinet. This allows them to sit flush beneath the cabinet with minimal overhang, optimizing kitchen layout while providing essential counter functionality. 

The depth requirement is usually around 6 to 7 inches, which matches the standard cabinet depth. Some models are available in slim profiles, measuring just 4.5 inches deep, making them suitable for deeper cabinets or under oven installations. 


### What maintenance is required for under cabinet coffee makers?

Basic maintenance for under cabinet coffee makers includes descaling the water reservoir every 3-4 months to prevent mineral buildup and maintain optimal brewing performance. The brew carafe, if not dishwasher-safe, should be hand-washed regularly with mild soap and warm water. 

Check the drip tray for residual water daily and empty it as needed to prevent mold growth. The brew basket and filter holder should be cleaned after each use to remove coffee grounds and residue. Regular cleaning of the coffee maker's exterior and drip area ensures both hygiene and longevity of the appliance.
