### What is the average battery life?

The typical battery life for a language translator device ranges from 6-16 hours, depending on usage patterns. Basic devices with offline translation capabilities generally have longer battery life than those requiring regular internet connectivity. 

Users should expect approximately 6-8 hours of active translation time per charge with moderate use. The battery life can be extended by reducing screen brightness, using offline features, and limiting background apps. 


### What is the typical price range?

The cost of language translator devices varies widely, from budget-friendly options priced at $40-100 to premium models exceeding $300. Budget devices often offer basic functionality and limited language support, while premium models include advanced features like dual-language earbuds and improved accuracy. 

The price typically reflects the number of supported languages, additional features, and build quality. It's important to balance cost with the specific features and languages needed for your translation needs.
