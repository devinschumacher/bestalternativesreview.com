## Buyer's Guide

Enhancing your bedroom's ambiance with above-bed art requires a thoughtful approach to ensure you select pieces that complement your space while making a meaningful statement. Consider these key factors to guide your choice of above-bed art. 


### Size and Proportion

This crucial element dictates how the artwork will visually impact your room. Measure the space above your bed and consider how different sizes will fill the area while maintaining balance with your bedding and room dimensions. As a general rule, artwork should not overwhelm the space – aim for a visual weight that feels harmonious with your bedroom's scale. 


### Style and Theme

Ensure your art selection aligns with your bedroom's existing style and color palette. Modern, minimalist designs work well in contemporary spaces, while larger-than-life paintings or sculptures can be perfect for traditional or rustic rooms. Consider whether you prefer natural elements, abstract forms, or specific motifs that resonate with your personal taste and room's atmosphere. 


### Installation and Safety

Proper installation is essential for both aesthetic and safety reasons. Check the artwork's weight capacity and select a mounting system that matches your ceiling's support capabilities. Also, consider practical aspects like the piece's frame depth and how it will sit in relation to your bed's height and your sleep position. 


### Personal Connection

While style and functionality are important, selecting art that holds personal meaning can elevate your choice. Consider pieces that remind you of special moments, inspire you, or simply make you smile. Whether it's a family photograph, a beloved landscape, or an abstract piece that speaks to your spirit, personal connection adds depth to your bedroom's decor. 


## FAQ


### What is above bed art?

Above bed art refers to any decorative piece hung above a bed, serving both functional and aesthetic purposes. These pieces can range from small wall-mounted mirrors to large canvases, and they help create a focal point in the bedroom. 

Common styles include minimalist art, nature scenes, abstract designs, and fine prints, allowing you to choose pieces that complement your existing bedroom decor. 


### How do you choose the right size for above bed art?

The ideal size depends on your room's dimensions and personal preference. A general rule is for the artwork to be about 1/3 the width of your bed frame, but you can adjust based on your space and style preference. 

Consider mounting multiple smaller pieces in a gallery wall format if your ceiling height or room size makes hanging a single large piece impractical. 


### What about framing options for above bed art?

Matte or soft-edged frames work well above beds, as they reduce visual clutter and maintain a calm atmosphere. The frame should complement your bedding and decorating style while providing adequate protection for the artwork. 

Choose frames with simple, clean lines and consider glass or UV protective coating to preserve your art's quality over time. 


### How do you properly hang above bed art?

Use leveler tools to ensure your piece hangs straight on the wall. For heavier pieces, consider mounting brackets that can support their weight safely. The center of the artwork should ideally align with the foot of your bed, creating visual balance. 

Use appropriate wall anchors and hardware for both drywall and masonry walls, following manufacturer instructions for your specific piece. 


### Can you mix different types of above bed art?

Mixing media types like photography, paintings, and mirrors can create visual interest and tell a story about your interests and personality. Ensure the styles and themes of your pieces complement each other to maintain visual harmony. 

If you're hanging multiple pieces, consider a unified theme or color scheme to create a cohesive look rather than a haphazard collection of items. 


### How do you maintain above bed art?

Regularly dust your artwork with a microfiber cloth to remove surface debris. Avoid using harsh chemicals that might damage the frame or artwork. For framed pieces, check the sealant regularly and replace any damaged glass or backing materials. 

If your art is prone to dust accumulation, consider placing it away from direct air flow sources like vents or open windows. For digital prints or photo displays, dust behind the frame as well to prevent moisture buildup.
