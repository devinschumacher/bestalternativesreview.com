The device stores all documents locally, meaning you can work on your writing without an internet connection. Once you're satisfied with your document, you can transfer it to another computer or print it directly from the device. 

Since all processing happens locally, the Neo 2 doesn't require any special software or drivers on your computer – simply connect via USB to transfer files.

You can write novels, academic papers, business documents, or any type of text-based content. The device's word processor features basic formatting options like bold, italic, and underline, as well as number and letter lists.

![Alphasmart-Neo-2-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Alphasmart-Neo-2-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How is the Alphasmart Neo 2 powered, and how long does the battery last?

The device runs on a rechargeable battery that powers both the keyboard and screen. A full charge typically lasts 12 hours of regular use, including screen time and keyboard operation. 

When the battery is low, you can continue using the keyboard to enter text, though the screen will display a message indicating the need for charging. 


### What technical specifications should I consider before purchasing?

The Neo 2 uses Android 10 with a custom interface optimized for writing. It features 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage, which is sufficient for basic writing tasks but limits the number of documents you can open simultaneously. 

Since the device doesn't support external storage or additional apps, ensure that 8GB is enough for your writing needs without needing to store documents elsewhere.
