## Buyer's Guide

Cargo skirts are an important component of vehicle protection and appearance. These protective covers extend from the rear of the vehicle to shield cargo areas from road debris and weather elements. They come in various styles and materials, each with different benefits and applications. 


### Length and Coverage

The length of a cargo skirt determines how much of the cargo area it covers. Longer skirts offer better protection from road debris but may be more cumbersome in tight parking situations. Consider the specific needs of your vehicle and local driving conditions when selecting an appropriate length.

### Mounting Options

Cargo skirts can be mounted in several ways: direct attachment to the vehicle, installation over existing cargo bars, or standalone models. Direct attachment provides the most secure fit but requires modifications to the vehicle. Installation over cargo bars offers flexibility but may affect aerodynamics. Standalone models are easiest to install but might not provide the same level of protection. 


### Multifunctional Features

Modern cargo skirts often include additional features like integrated cargo nets, tie-down points, or storage pockets. These extras can enhance functionality but may increase weight and bulk. Consider whether these features align with your specific needs for organization and protection.

### Maintenance and Material

The material of a cargo skirt affects its durability and maintenance requirements. Premium materials like TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane) and PVC offer better protection from wear and tear but may be more expensive. Consider the climate you'll be driving in, as some materials perform better in extreme hot or cold conditions. 


## FAQ

![Cargo-Skirt-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cargo-Skirt-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a cargo skirt?

A cargo skirt is a protective covering that extends downward from the rear of a vehicle's cargo area, designed to shield the bed from road debris, weather elements, and maintenance needs. It provides both practical protection and aesthetic enhancement to pickup trucks and utility vehicles. 

These skirts vary significantly in design and functionality, from basic plastic models that prevent gravel kickback to more comprehensive options that integrate tailgate clearance, cargo management features, and styling elements. 


### How do cargo skirts protect my vehicle?

Cargo skirts protect your vehicle's bed by creating a barrier between the cargo area and external elements. This prevents rock chips, dirt, and debris from damaging the bed's surface or causing maintenance issues, particularly during highway travel or off-road excursions. 

The protective properties of cargo skirts also extend to extending the useful life of your vehicle by reducing exposure to corrosive chemicals, salt, and harsh weather conditions that can affect the bed's integrity over time. 

![Cargo-Skirt-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cargo-Skirt-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What materials are cargo skirts typically made from?

The most common materials for cargo skirts are polyethylene, PVC, and rubber, due to their durability, weather resistance, and affordability. These materials provide a balance between protection and flexibility for mounting. 

Higher-end models may incorporate composites or metal elements for increased rigidity and durability, particularly in areas that require additional support for cargo weight or tailgate clearance. 


### How do I choose the right cargo skirt for my vehicle?

Selecting the appropriate cargo skirt depends on your specific vehicle model, bed style, and intended use. Measure your vehicle's bed height and length to ensure the skirt fits properly and provides adequate protection. 

Consider your intended use (hunting, camping, hauling) and any specific features you need, such as tailgate clearance, cargo management options, or built-in lighting. Compatibility with your vehicle's accessories and color matching with your vehicle's exterior are also important factors.

### Do cargo skirts affect vehicle handling or performance?

Most cargo skirts have minimal impact on vehicle handling due to their relatively light weight and aerodynamic design. The primary influence is on aerodynamics, which can slightly reduce fuel efficiency, particularly at higher speeds. 

Some higher-profile skirts may affect visibility or require modifications to other vehicle components, such as tailgate clearance. However, these impacts are generally minor and vary based on the specific design and installation. 


### How do I install a cargo skirt?

Installation typically requires basic tools such as a drill, measuring tape, and possibly a helper for support. Most skirts come with mounting brackets that attach to the bed's sides using bolts or screws. 

Follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully, as some models may require cutting the mounting brackets to fit specific vehicles. Proper installation ensures optimal protection and prevents damage to both the skirt and vehicle during use.
