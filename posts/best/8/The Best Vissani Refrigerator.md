## FAQ


### What are the energy consumption specifications of the Vissani refrigerator?

The Vissani refrigerator consumes approximately 0.95 kWh per day, which translates to an annual energy consumption of about 350 kWh. This efficient rating helps keep operating costs low while maintaining consistent cooling performance. 

For comparison, a typical household refrigerator consumes between 0.6 and 1 kWh per day. The Vissani model's performance falls within the mid-range of modern refrigerators, offering good value without excessive energy consumption. 


### How do I properly maintain the Vissani refrigerator?

Regular maintenance includes checking for proper door seals, cleaning the condenser coils, and ensuring adequate clearance around the refrigerator. The seal should allow a piece of paper to slide in but not fall out when placed against the door frame. 

Every three months, unplug the refrigerator and vacuum the condenser coils, located at the back or bottom. This maintenance can improve efficiency by up to 30% and extend the appliance's lifespan. 


### What unique features does the Vissani refrigerator offer?

The Vissani refrigerator includes adjustable shelving, LED interior lighting, and a precision temperature control system. The adjustable shelving allows customization of storage space, while LED lights provide clear visibility and energy efficiency. 

Additional features include a built-in water dispenser with filtration and a reversible door design, providing flexibility in how the refrigerator fits into your kitchen layout. 


### How does the Vissani refrigerator compare to similar models in terms of capacity?

Standard Vissani models range from 23 to 32 cubic feet in capacity. For comparison, a medium-sized refrigerator typically ranges between 18 and 26 cubic feet. The 32-cubic-foot model offers significant storage space, suitable for larger households or frequent entertaining. 

Smaller 23-cubic-foot models maintain generous capacity while being more compact, making them ideal for apartments or smaller kitchens. 


### What warranty coverage does the Vissani refrigerator provide?

Vissani offers a basic warranty that covers parts and labor for one year from the date of purchase. Most components are covered under this warranty, including the compressor, motor, and other major components. 

For an additional fee, they also offer extended warranties that can cover up to seven years of parts and labor protection. This extended coverage is particularly recommended for high-value or multi-door models. 


### How does the Vissani refrigerator perform in warmer climates?

Based on testing in various climates, the Vissani refrigerator maintains consistent performance even in temperatures up to 104°F (40°C). This performance is due to its efficient cooling system and proper installation requirements. 

However, in extremely hot environments, it's important to ensure proper ventilation, maintain recommended clearance around the refrigerator, and consider the location's ambient temperature when determining suitability.
