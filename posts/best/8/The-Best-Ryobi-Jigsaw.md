### Are Ryobi jigsaws compatible with standard 10-inch blades?

Yes, Ryobi jigsaws accept standard 10-inch blades, which are widely available in the market. This compatibility ensures you can choose blades based on specific cutting requirements, whether it's wood, plastic, or metal applications. 

When mounting blades, always follow the manufacturer's guidelines to ensure proper alignment and secure installation. This step is crucial for both performance and safety during use.
