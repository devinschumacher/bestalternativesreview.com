## Buyer's Guide

The Benjamin Moore Natural Collection offers a range of interior paint options with natural ingredients. When selecting a Natural Cream shade, consider factors like durability, stain resistance, and breathability to ensure long-term satisfaction with your paint choice. 


### Color Selection

Pick a shade that complements your existing color palette while considering natural light conditions in the room. Warm lighting may make cool tones appear greener, while cooler lighting can affect how yellow-based creams appear.
