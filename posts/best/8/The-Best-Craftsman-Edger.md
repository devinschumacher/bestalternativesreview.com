## Buyer's Guide

A Craftsman edger is a specialized tool designed for creating clean, professional edges around garden beds, walkways, and other landscaping features. This guide outlines key factors to consider when selecting the right Craftsman edger for your project, ensuring you make an informed choice. 


### Power Source Options

Craftsman edgers come in both corded and cordless models, each with its own advantages. Corded edgers provide consistent power without the need for recharging but require access to an electrical outlet. Cordless edgers offer greater mobility and convenience, though they need to be recharged between uses. 


### Shaft Design and Control

The edger's shaft design significantly affects user comfort and control. Look for a shaft with adjustable extension for different blade heights and reach. The handle should provide ergonomic support and allow for secure, precise control during operation. 


### Blade Specifications

Inspect the edger's blade for quality and durability. Premium blades are ceramic or hardened steel with fine teeth for clean cuts. Consider the blade height adjustability for working in various depths of mulch or soil. The blade should also be reversible for extended use. 


### Additional Features

Certain edgers include helpful features like depth guides for consistent cuts, blade guards for safety, and LED lights for nighttime use. Consider whether these features enhance your specific needs and usage scenarios. 


## FAQ


### What is a Craftsman Edger, and how does it differ from other edging tools?

Additionally, look for features like blade retention, tool storage, and built-in measuring systems that enhance usability. 

Measure your working space to ensure the tool fits comfortably, and consider your specific needs (e. g. , steep slopes, tight spaces) when choosing between different models. 


### How much does a Craftsman Edger cost, and what is the typical lifespan?

Craftsman edgers range in price from around $50 to $300, depending on features and power source. The cost varies between manual, electric, and battery-powered models, with additional attachments often available separately.
