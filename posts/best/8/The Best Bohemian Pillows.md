## FAQ


### What makes a pillow bohemian?

Bohemian pillows blend eclectic elements like fringes, tassels, and feathers with earthy tones and natural materials. They often feature mixed patterns, vintage fabrics, and bold embroidery. 

The boho style emphasizes craftsmanship and cultural influences, making each pillow unique. Think layered textures, handwoven details, and globally inspired designs. 


### How should bohemian pillows be used?

Bolster pillows work best as statement pieces on beds or sofas. Their dramatic presence adds visual interest and texture to any space. 

Smaller boho throw pillows are ideal for mixing patterns and colors throughout living areas. They create visual depth while keeping the space balanced and cohesive. 


### What are the key materials in bohemian pillows?

Natural fabrics like cotton, wool, and linen are common, often in their natural, unprocessed state. These materials allow for intricate embroidery and dyeing techniques. 

Other materials include feathers, jute rope, and macrame elements, which add both visual and textural interest to the pillows. 


### How should I care for my bohemian pillows?

Most boho pillows can be spot cleaned. Check specific care instructions based on the materials used, but generally avoid machine washing to prevent damage to handmade elements. 

For feather pillows, consider using a decorative pillow protector to maintain their shape and prevent loose feathers. These protectors are available in various styles to match your boho aesthetic. 


### How do I choose the right size for my boho pillow?

Standard pillow sizes like 16x16 inches work well for mixing with larger boho pillows. This size creates visual interest without overwhelming smaller spaces. 

For a more contemporary look, opt for 20x20 inches as your base size, then mix in smaller elements. This creates a balanced composition that's both boho and modern. 


### Where can I find authentic bohemian pillows?

Vintage shops and flea markets often have original boho pillows that show wear and tear, adding character to your collection. These local finds can also be more affordable. 

Look for specialized retailers that source directly from artisans in countries like Morocco, Turkey, and Peru. These stores typically offer the most authentic boho pieces.
