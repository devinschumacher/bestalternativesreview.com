### What's the difference between the LED and UV curing lights?

LED curing lights are more energy-efficient and cause less heat buildup, making them ideal for nail salons and frequent use. They require fewer bulbs and have a longer lifespan. 

UV curing lights work with both LED and UV polishes, offering versatility. They may produce more heat and require regular bulb replacement, making them slightly less practical for daily use. 


### Can the nail polish be applied by non-professionals?

Yes, our nail polishes are designed for at-home application and are easy for beginners to use. The formula is self-leveling and doesn't require salon-quality tools. 

For first-time users, we recommend watching online tutorials to learn proper technique and achieve the best results. The polishes dry quickly and resist smudging, even for first-time users.
