### What's the difference between the Deskjet 4155e and other HP Deskjet models?

The HP Deskjet 4155e offers a balance of features and performance suitable for home office and small office use. Compared to more basic models, it includes wireless connectivity and a memory card slot for direct photo printing, while more advanced models typically offer higher print speeds or enhanced connectivity options. 

As a mid-range model, the 4155e excels in document printing and includes convenience features like automatic duplexing and a monthly duty cycle of 10,000 pages, making it reliable for both personal and small business use. 


### How does the memory card slot work?

To print directly from memory cards, the 4155e requires the latest firmware update. Supported card formats include SD, SDHC, and SDXC. The printer can detect and print photos automatically, or you can browse using a connected computer or smart device via HP SmartApp. 

Print quality varies by card format and photo size. For best results, we recommend printing photos at 4x6 inches or smaller. The printer supports JPEG and PNG file formats for photo printing. 

![Hp-Deskjet-4155e-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Hp-Deskjet-4155e-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the duty cycle and page yield?

The duty cycle of 10,000 pages reflects the maximum number of pages the printer can reliably produce in its lifetime. The page yield of 100 pages per 10% of the cartridge capacity means you should expect about 1,000 pages from a full ink cartridge. 

Actual page yields can vary based on print density, page size, and number of pages printed per cartridge. The printer automatically tracks usage and displays remaining pages in the HP SmartApp or through the printer's control panel. 


### How does the wireless connectivity work?

The printer connects to Wi-Fi networks using the HP SmartApp or through the printer's control panel. With HP Smart, you can print from compatible devices, manage printer settings, and receive notifications about ink levels and print jobs. 

The 4155e supports both 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi bands, with 5GHz offering faster connections for larger files. For setting up multiple devices, we recommend using the HP Smart app on a smartphone or tablet for its intuitive interface and device management features.

### What are the power requirements and dimensions?

The printer operates on standard household electricity with a power consumption of 12.5 watts in standby mode and 19 watts during printing. The dimensions are 13.2 x 14.2 x 3.7 inches (WxHxD), making it suitable for desktop or shelf placement. 

When powered off, the printer automatically enters low-power mode and can be awakened quickly for printing. The included power cord is standard US-style for compatibility with most household sockets. 


### What's the warranty coverage?

HP offers a one-year warranty on parts and labor for the Deskjet 4155e, with an option to extend to four years. During the warranty period, you can get replacement parts and repairs at no additional cost. 

For the best service, use authorized HP parts and follow recommended maintenance procedures. If you need assistance, the printer displays service codes that can be looked up online to determine the required maintenance or replacement part.
