## FAQ


### What scents make up the Pink Friday fragrance?

The centerpiece of Pink Friday is a captivating blend of passionfruit and strawberry. These vibrant fruits are balanced with deeper tones of vanilla bean and vanilla pod, creating a signature scent that blends youthful exuberance with mature notes. 

Additional elements include hints of peach and freesia, adding a touch of sweetness and freshness to the overall composition. The base brings elements of cashmere wood and tonka bean, providing longevity and depth. 


### What is the recommended usage for Pink Friday?

For the best results, apply Pink Friday directly to pulse points: wrists, neck, and behind the ears. These areas have the warmest body heat, which releases the fragrance most effectively. 

A light application throughout the day is ideal - reapplying every couple of hours can help maintain your scent throughout the day. 


### How does Pink Friday compare to other Nicki Minaj fragrances?

Pink Friday stands out from previous Nicki Minaj releases like The Pink Friday Rap Album and Reloaded by focusing more on fruity and vanilla notes. Unlike Reloaded's spicy scent, Pink Friday offers a sweeter, more contemporary fragrance profile. 

The fragrance intensity is medium to strong, making it more suitable for daily wear compared to more aggressive options in the market. 


### What packaging features does Pink Friday offer?

The bottle features a striking pink hue with gold accents, while the cap incorporates a crystal element for added shine. The sleek, modern design matches the fragrance's bold yet feminine character. 

The package includes a spray mechanism that provides consistent, measured bursts of fragrance, helping you control how much you apply. 


### How long does Pink Friday last on different skin types?

On most skin types, the fragrance lasts approximately 4-6 hours. For oilier skin or warm environments, the scent may dissipate more quickly. Applying after a shower, when skin is slightly damp, helps the fragrance bond more effectively. 

Dry skin types may retain the fragrance longer, while individuals who maintain cooler body temperatures might notice the scent lasts slightly longer than average. 


### What occasions is Pink Friday suitable for?

This fragrance pairs well with casual to semi-formal occasions due to its modern yet approachable scent profile. It works great for daytime wear and can transition into evening if not over-applied. The balance of fruity and vanilla notes makes it suitable for both personal use and social events.
