## Buyer's Guide

Carnelian rings blend striking red-orange hues with natural stone beauty, offering both decorative and therapeutic properties. Understanding the key aspects of carnelian rings helps in selecting a piece that matches your preferences and needs. 


### Stone Quality and Durability

Carnelian ranks 7 on the Mohs hardness scale, making it suitable for everyday wear. Opt for rings with well-formed, translucent stones free from significant inclusions. The color should be even across the stone, with deep orange-red tones prized over lighter shades. 


### Setting and Metal Quality

Secure settings protect the stone while showcasing its beauty. Popular choices include bezel settings that completely encircle the stone and prong settings that allow the stone to sit higher in the ring. The metal should be of at least 14k quality, with yellow or white gold options providing good color contrast to the warm stone tones. 


### Size and Comfort

Proper sizing ensures the ring feels comfortable and secure on your finger. Consider that carnelian's natural shape often results in slightly irregularly cut stones, which can affect size measurements. The setting should allow free movement without wiggling, while the stone's size complements the ring finger's width. 


### Cost Considerations

Price varies based on stone quality, size, and metal content. Larger, more evenly colored stones command higher prices. Consider a combination of factors like carat weight (. 5-1ct is common), stone cut, and metal purity to find a ring that meets your budget while providing long-term value.
