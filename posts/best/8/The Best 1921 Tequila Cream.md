## Buyer's Guide

When selecting a 1921 Tequila Cream, several factors come into play, from proof and flavor profile to bottle size and brand reputation. Understanding these aspects helps you find a product that meets your taste preferences and consumption needs. 


### Proof and Strength

1921 Tequila Cream typically ranges from 15% to 30% alcohol by volume (ABV). The higher the proof, the more intense the alcohol content. Consider your drinking habits and whether you prefer a lighter or stronger spirit.

### Bottle Size

Standard bottle sizes range from 750ml to 1-liter, with some brands offering smaller 375ml options. Consider how often you'll use the product and whether you prefer to buy larger quantities for hosting or smaller bottles for personal consumption.

### What is 1921 Tequila Cream?

1921 Tequila Cream is a premium tequila cream liqueur crafted to blend rich tequila flavors with creamy notes. Unlike cheaper alternatives, this liqueur features natural cream and authentic Mexican spirits, providing a smoother and more sophisticated drinking experience. 

Each bottle pairs traditional tequila production methods with modern distillation techniques, resulting in a silky smooth spirit that's perfect for sipping straight or mixing into your favorite cocktails. 


### What makes 1921 Tequila Cream different from other tequila cream products?

While many tequila cream drinks contain artificial flavors and high-fructose corn syrup, 1921 maintains its premium status by using natural cream and premium tequilas in their recipe. This commitment to quality results in a creamier texture and more authentic tequila flavor profile. 

The company also sources their ingredients directly from Mexico, ensuring the use of traditional agave varieties and adherence to age-old distillation techniques that set authentic Mexican tequila apart from mass-produced alternatives.

### What occasions are best for enjoying 1921 Tequila Cream?

Its smooth finish and rich flavor make it excellent for after-dinner sipping, especially when paired with rich desserts like chocolate cake or freshly grilled steak. The cream base also works wonders in holiday drinks, making it a versatile addition to your seasonal cocktail collection. 

For casual entertaining, try it in classic Mexican drinks like a Tequila Sunrise or a Paloma, where the cream adds a luxurious twist to these traditional favorites. 


### Can you mix 1921 Tequila Cream in cocktails?

The cream liqueur's smooth texture makes it perfect for cocktails, as it doesn't separate when shaken or stirred with other ingredients. Popular combinations include margaritas, mojitos, and spicy Mexican-themed drinks where the cream provides a cooling contrast to heat. 

However, its premium nature suggests using it sparingly in mixed drinks, usually in 1-2oz increments, to maintain balance and let the tequila's nuances shine through. 

![1921-Tequila-Cream-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/1921-Tequila-Cream-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How should I store 1921 Tequila Cream?

Like all premium liquors, 1921 Tequila Cream should be stored in a cool, dark place to preserve its flavor and color. The optimal temperature range is between 50-68°F (10-20°C), and it's best kept away from direct sunlight and extreme temperature changes. 

The sealed bottle can last several years if stored properly, but once opened, it's recommended to consume within 6 months for peak flavor. 


### What's the alcohol content of 1921 Tequila Cream?

Each serving of 1921 Tequila Cream contains 18% alcohol by volume (ABV), making it stronger than some cream liqueurs but still approachable for most drinkers. This concentration allows the natural flavors to come through while maintaining a proper balance of sweetness and spirit. 

Due to its higher alcohol content, it's important to savor this liqueur rather than chugging it neat – a single serving is plenty to experience its complex profile without feeling overwhelmed.
