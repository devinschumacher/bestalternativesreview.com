These super-comfortable Teva sandals are a hit with people who've tried them, thanks to their cushioned EVA foam sole that's fantastic for wide feet like mine. The full-length footbed really supported my arches during my 20,000+ steps at the music festival, and the self-cleaning properties made poolside maintenance a breeze. While some folks find them too big and need to size down, my pair has been my go-to for both casual walking and light hiking. 


### [Teva Women's ReEmber Vistaverse](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Teva+Slippers?utm\_term=teva-womens-reember-vistaverse)

![Teva Women's ReEmber Vistaverse | Image](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcRgtBRJnhFZkU6CCjqIyWScOPgmWfWUoAFMXF0MfKdOUgpTU-ZDSYrmqa4iwIgR7ahSNJrHKXQMMK\_fIUdCsdYHM9e2ZGDt&usqp=CAY)

These comfy slippers keep your feet snuggly wrapped in soft knit lining that's 50% recycled materials. The rubber sole gives you sure-footed traction whether you're romping through the yard or just shuffling around the house. The pull-on design makes them a breeze to slip on, thanks to a handy heel loop – though you might want to grab a shoehorn for those first few tries. 


### [Teva Men's Revive 95](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Teva+Slippers?utm\_term=teva-mens-revive-95)

![Teva Men's Revive 95 | Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcQAhYgUrRZmbjyqyoiLxs4v6d73jp4FTsT0LYJlgXWKaqiF8RHhwvjjoitb12WE4dZg-e05aLbDaeW2yFZovSRmiJNXvE6mgw&usqp=CAY)

### [Teva Men's ReEmber Total Eclipse / 11](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Teva+Slippers?utm\_term=teva-mens-reember-total-eclipse-11)

![Teva Men's ReEmber Total Eclipse / 11 | Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcQiKGLk42N3GhgIX2rS3D6AbWdhvqGnW9FHA5qzpS6pGzufaZlEumrI9iae-qfcYZr7wMdUEAnVlkuFmKseJ1ch9cl\_gcX5Sw&usqp=CAY)

These slip-on shoes do an impressive job of balancing comfort and functionality, featuring a flexible textile upper that stretches a bit over time. While they excel as cozy house slippers, particularly for those who need extra warmth, their performance as outdoor footwear is a bit disappointing. The lightweight construction means your feet might get cold quickly in cooler weather, and while they're decent for short trips around the house, their lack of support makes them unsuitable for more strenuous activities. Overall, they're a good choice for indoor relaxation or casual errands, especially if you have sensitive feet that need extra cushioning.

Crafted from recycled materials with a protective water-beading coating, these slip-ons combine cozy recycled polyester construction with a collapsible heel design that makes them both versatile and easy to wear. The recycled rubber outsole delivers durable traction whether you're inside or out, while the cushioned polyurethane footbed provides lasting comfort for everyday wear.

## Buyer's Guide

Teva slippers combine comfort, functionality, and durability, making them popular for both casual wear and specific activities. Understanding their key features and considerations will help you select the right pair for your needs. 


### Materials and Construction

The upper should be made from breathable, moisture-wicking materials like mesh or synthetic leather. Durable rubber outsoles provide grip and protection. Look for reinforced toes and flexible midsoles that enhance stability during movement.

### Durability and Long-term Use

Select slippers with seam-taped edges and reinforced stitching for extended wear. The construction should resist curling at the edges and maintain its shape over time. Consider slippers designed for specific activities if you'll be using them regularly in one environment (e. g. , shower shoes). 


### Care and Maintenance

Choose slippers that can be machine-washed for easy cleaning. Look for water-repellent treatments in the material to maintain their shape and prevent odors. Slippers with removable insoles are easier to clean and allow for airing out between uses.

### Size and Fit

Fit is crucial for comfort and longevity. Measure your feet at their widest point to ensure proper width. The slippers should allow one-half inch of space between your longest toe and the end of the toe box. Consider your typical arch support level when selecting the height of the heel cup. 


## FAQ

![Teva-Slippers-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Teva-Slippers-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What makes Teva slippers unique?

Teva slippers combine comfort, functionality, and durability through their patented EVA footbed, which provides excellent arch support while remaining lightweight. The mesh upper allows for good ventilation, keeping feet cool during extended wear. 

The outsole features deep traction patterns that grip well on various surfaces, from indoor floors to outdoor paths. The synthetic material construction resists wear and tear, maintaining the slipper's shape and support over time. 


### What sizes do Teva slippers come in?

Teva offers multiple style options across different sizing ranges. Most models run true to size, with some variations based on style. Men's sizes typically range from 6 to 14, while women's sizes usually go from 5.5 to 13.5. 

For the best fit, measure your foot length and width, then refer to Teva's specific size charts available on their website. These charts account for any variations in sizing between styles. 

![Teva-Slippers-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Teva-Slippers-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do I properly care for Teva slippers?

To maintain the quality and appearance of your Teva slippers, wipe them clean with a damp cloth after each use. For tougher stains, you can use mild soap and water, but avoid using harsh chemicals which may damage the synthetic material. 

Air dry your slippers completely before wearing them again. Avoid using a dryer or direct heat, as this can warp the shape of the footbed and damage the material. 


### Are Teva slippers suitable for all seasons?

While Teva's synthetic material withstands most weather conditions, their primary emphasis is on summer comfort. The lightweight construction and mesh upper provide excellent ventilation during warmer months, but these slippers may not retain heat as well in cold weather. 

For cooler climates, consider pairing your Teva slippers with thin socks or using them indoors where heating is present. The EVA footbed does not insulate effectively, so your feet may feel cold in very chilly conditions. 

![Teva-Slippers-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Teva-Slippers-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the main styles of Teva slippers?

Teva offers several classic styles, including their popular Original Sandal, Universal Sandal, and Hiker Sandal. Each model features variations in color blocking and synthetic materials but maintains the brand's signature EVA footbed and deep traction outsole. 

The brand also produces a range of unisex models, with some designs featuring extended hook-and-loop closures for better foot retention. Most Teva slippers share similar construction elements, with primary differences lying in the upper material patterns and color combinations. 


### Can I wear Teva slippers for exercise?

Although Teva slippers provide good arch support, their primary design focus is on casual comfort rather than performance. For light indoor activities like yoga or stretching, they may be suitable, but they lack the cushioning and stability needed for more intense exercise. 

The deep traction patterns make them practical for walking on various indoor surfaces, but their rigid mesh upper can feel restricting during dynamic movements. For general fitness, consider Teva's lightweight footwear options specifically designed for exercise activities.
