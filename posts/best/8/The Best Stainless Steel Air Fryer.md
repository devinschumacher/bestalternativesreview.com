When selecting a stainless steel air fryer, consider factors like capacity, power consumption, and additional features to find the right balance of performance and functionality for your cooking needs.

The cooking capacity of an air fryer determines how much food you can cook at once. The most common sizes range from 2 to 5 liters, which can accommodate between 1-4 servings per meal.
