## Buyer's Guide

Callaway's Epic Speed Driver has quickly become one of the most popular drivers on the market, thanks to its impressive distance potential and sleek design. Understanding what makes this driver unique and how it compares to other options can help you make an informed choice. 


### Key Technical Features

The Epic Speed Driver combines a larger 460cc clubhead with a high moment of inertia (MOI) and a heel-toe weight distribution. These design elements work together to provide forgiveness on off-center hits while maintaining a low center of gravity for maximum ball speed.

### Material and Construction

Callaway uses a dual-material construction with a lightweight titanium crown and a steel face. The titanium crown helps reduce clubhead weight, allowing for a larger face thickness while keeping the overall weight manageable. The steel face provides the necessary stiffness for energy transfer during impact. 


### Size and Fit Considerations

The driver's oversized shape (460cc) requires careful consideration of your swing speed and consistency. Faster swingers with consistent ball striking may benefit from the added size, while players with slower swing speeds or less consistent contact might prefer a more traditional sized driver.
