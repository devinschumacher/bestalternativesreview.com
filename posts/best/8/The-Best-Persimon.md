The persimmon-flavored block brings out deer's natural sweet tooth while providing essential minerals. Weighing four pounds, it's big enough to last but small enough to place on stumps or in mineral lick areas. While some customers report occasional shipping damage, the intact blocks work wonders for attracting deer, especially when placed out in early spring.

## Buyer's Guide

Persimmons are versatile fruits that range from tangy to sweet, depending on the variety. When buying persimmons, consider factors like ripeness, type, and intended use. This guide helps you select and store these seasonal fruits for the best culinary experience. 


### Ripeness and Texture

Check the skin for softness; ripe persimmons yield slightly to gentle pressure. The flesh should be smooth and free of lumps. Unripe persimmons are crisp, while extremely ripe ones can be mushy. 


### Common Varieties

Brazelgold and Butternut persimmons are sweet and eaten fresh. Hachiya requires softening before consumption. Fuyu persimmons maintain their shape when sliced, making them ideal for snacks and cooking. 


### Selecting Freshness

Choose persimmons with firm, unblemished skin. Ripe fruit may have natural cracks and should not be excessively soft. Store unripe persimmons at room temperature to mature, then refrigerate for preservation. 


### Storage Tips

Mature persimmons keep for up to a week in the refrigerator. Unripe fruit benefits from a few days at room temperature. Avoid storing different varieties together as they release gases that can affect neighboring produce. 


## FAQ


### What are persimmons?

Persimmons are a subtropical fruit with a rich, naturally sweet flavor. They're closely related to oranges and share similarities in their nutrient profile and culinary applications. 

There are two primary types: astringent (like Hachiya) and non-astringent (like Fuyu). Astringent varieties have a high tannin content that gives them a puckering taste when unripe, while non-astringent varieties lack these tannins and can be eaten when fully ripe. 


### Where do persimmons grow?

Persimmon trees are native to Asia but have been successfully cultivated in many parts of the world, including the United States, Europe, and Australia. They thrive in mild climates and require at least 6-8 hours of daily sunlight. 

The main growing regions in the U. S. are in California, Texas, and Florida. In Europe, persimmons are commonly grown in Mediterranean countries like Italy and Spain. 


### How do you pick ripe persimmons?

For astringent varieties, choose fruit with a vibrant color and slightly soft skin when gently pressed. Ripe non-astringent persimmons should be slightly soft to the touch and fully colored. 

Avoid fruit with soft spots, cuts, or mold. Persimmons that are still hard and green need more time to ripen and may have an astringent taste. 


### What's the best way to store persimmons?

Persimmons ripen quickly and should be kept at room temperature until fully ripe. For storage, place them in a paper bag with an apple or banana to speed up the ripening process. 

Ripe persimmons can be refrigerated for up to 10 days in a plastic bag. Non-astringent varieties typically ripen faster than astringent types. 


### Can you refrigerate persimmons before they're ripe?

Yes, you can refrigerate unripe persimmons to speed up the ripening process. Place a ripe apple or banana in the same bag to help release ethylene gas, which triggers ripening. 

If you refrigerate unripe persimmons, check them daily. Ripe persimmons should be transferred to room temperature to prevent spoilage. 


### What's the nutritional value of persimmons?

Persimmons are low in calories but high in fiber, antioxidants, and vitamins A and C. One medium persimmon contains about 60 calories, 2 grams of fiber, and 10% of your daily vitamin C needs. 

Additionally, persimmons contain potassium, vitamin K, and flavonoid antioxidants that support heart health, immune function, and cellular repair.
