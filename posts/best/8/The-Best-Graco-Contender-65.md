## Buyer's Guide

The Graco Contender 65 is a popular car seat designed for children weighing between 22 and 65 pounds. This comprehensive guide will help you understand the key features, installation requirements, and safety considerations of this car seat model. 


### Key Features

As a convertible seat, the Graco Contender 65 offers dual-mode functionality as both a forward- and rear-facing seat. The seat includes a five-point harness system for securing the child and padded headrests that move forward as the child grows. The base of the seat features easy-locking wheels and a carrying handle for convenient installation in different vehicles. 


### Installation Requirements

Proper installation is crucial for the seat's effectiveness. The Graco Contender 65 requires a tightening mechanism in the base, such as seat belts or LATCH (Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children) system. The seat should be installed in the back seat of the vehicle, away from airbags. The five-point harness must be adjusted to ensure the child is secure and comfortable during travel. 


### Safety Considerations

Safety standards and testing results are essential when selecting a car seat. The Graco Contender 65 meets current federal safety standards and has passed rigorous testing protocols. Parents should regularly inspect the seat for wear and tear, replace it when the vehicle compatibility chart indicates it's time, and follow the manufacturer's guidelines for maintenance and cleaning. 


### Additional Tips

While the Graco Contender 65 is a reliable choice, several factors influence its suitability for your family. Consider the seat's weight limit, compatibility with your vehicle, and ease of installation. Read reviews from other parents who have used the same model to gauge its practicality and comfort level during trips. Regularly check the manufacturer's website for updates on recalls or necessary maintenance. 


## FAQ


### What is the Graco Contender 65?

The Graco Contender 65 is a high-back car seat recommended for infants from 4 to 40 pounds and toddlers from 4 to 65 pounds. It offers both rear-facing and forward-facing configurations, providing versatility for different stages of child growth. 

Manufactured by Graco, the Contender 65 combines durable construction with features designed for ease of use, including a five-point harness system and a simple one-hand seat recline mechanism. 


### What age and weight range is the Contender 65 suitable for?

The seat is appropriate for infants who weigh between 4 and 40 pounds when rear-facing, typically from birth to 1 year (or when the child exceeds the 40-pound limit). For forward-facing use, it accommodates children between 20 and 65 pounds, usually until age 8. 

Parents should consider that the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends keeping children rear-facing until they reach at least 2 years old and exceed the rear-facing weight limit, if possible. 


### How does the Contender 65 compare in terms of size to other Graco car seats?

Compared to the Graco Swift, the Contender 65 is comparable in height but slightly wider, making it more suitable for children with larger torso sizes. It's also narrower than the Graco ComfortGLS, providing better fit in some vehicle compartments. 

The seat's backrest measures 21 inches tall in upright position, allowing more head and neck support than shorter 17-inch-backrest seats in the same category. 


### What safety standards does the Contender 65 meet?

The seat meets both the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 213 (FMVSS 213) and undergoes rigorous testing by third-party organizations including the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). 

It incorporates energy-absorbing foam and a thick plastic frame to protect the child in case of a crash, while the five-point harness system helps distribute impact forces safely across the body. 


### Are there any specific installation requirements?

To install the seat rear-facing, parents must use the lower LATCH system or seat belt with tighteners for proper securing. The top tether strap must be attached at the highest available tether anchor. 

When installed forward-facing, the seat can use the lower LATCH system or seat belt, though the seat belt method is recommended for its better positioning. The top tether strap must still be used in all cases when the height of the vehicle seat allows. 


### What additional features does the Contender 65 offer?

The seat includes a padded headrest that grows with the child from 4 to 13.5 inches, an adjustable harness chest clip, and reinforced shoulder harness slots for proper harness positioning. 

Additional features include a one-hand recline mechanism, an easy-to-clean padded mesh backrest, and a travel clip for quick transitions between car and stroller. The base features rubber feet for stability and a lockable recline level.
