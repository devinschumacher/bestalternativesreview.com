### Application and Drying Time

These glue sticks apply smoothly and consistently, making them ideal for small to medium projects. They typically dry within 2-3 minutes, allowing quick handling of bonded materials. Avoid using under direct sunlight or in high humidity, as this can affect drying time. 


### Storage and Usage Considerations

Store UHU glue sticks in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight, which can degrade the adhesive properties. The tubes seal tightly to prevent evaporation and contamination. For best results, use the glue within 12 months of purchase. 


### Eco-Friendly Options and Usage Tips

Look for UHU's eco-friendly glue sticks made from renewable resources. These perform similarly to traditional formulas but have a lower environmental impact. Apply in thin, even layers to prevent sagging or uneven bonding. 


## FAQ


### What types of materials can Uhu glue sticks bond?

Uhu glue sticks effectively bond paper, cardboard, thin plastic, fabrics, and light metal. They work well on both porous and non-porous surfaces, making them versatile for various crafts and household projects. 

These glue sticks perform best on clean, dry surfaces. Avoid using them on glossy paper, glass, or non-porous surfaces where proper adhesion may be compromised. 


### How long does Uhu glue stick take to dry?

Uhu glue sticks dry almost instantly upon application, making them ideal for quick bonding projects. The dried bond reaches full strength within 24 hours, allowing for cutting and trimming of bonded materials without immediate adhesion. 

After initial application, the glue sets in seconds but continues to cure over time. For best results, allow 24 hours before exposing the bonded materials to heavy loads or moisture. 


### Can Uhu glue sticks be used on porous materials?

Yes, Uhu glue sticks perform well on porous materials like paper, cardboard, and light fabrics. The adhesive penetrates these surfaces effectively, providing strong bonds without the need for surface preparation. 

For best results on porous materials, ensure the surface is clean and dry before application. Avoid using the glue on heavily textured or uneven surfaces where adhesion may be less reliable. 


### How should I store Uhu glue sticks?

Store Uhu glue sticks in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and extreme temperature changes. Proper storage helps maintain the stick's shape and ensures consistent application. 

Do not store in refrigerators or freezers, as temperature fluctuations can affect the glue's consistency. Replace the glue stick cap tightly after each use to prevent moisture absorption. 


### What are the main ingredients in Uhu glue sticks?

Uhu glue sticks contain natural rubber and other proprietary ingredients that provide strong bonding properties. The exact formula is not publicly disclosed, but natural rubber is the primary component. 

These glue sticks are water-based, meaning they contain no solvent-based chemicals. This makes them safer to use than many industrial adhesives, while still providing reliable bonding performance. 


### How do I remove Uhu glue stick residue?

For best results, remove Uhu glue stick residue from tools and surfaces promptly using warm water and a soft cloth or brush. The adhesive is water-soluble, making it easier to clean up while still fresh.
