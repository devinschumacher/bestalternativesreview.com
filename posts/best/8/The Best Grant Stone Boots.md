## FAQ

![Grant-Stone-Boots-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Grant-Stone-Boots-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are Grant Stone Boots made from?

Grant Stone Boots combine natural materials with modern construction techniques. The upper is made from premium leather in select models, while the outsole features a durable rubber compound. Some models incorporate a stone-washed finish for added texture and character. 

The boots utilize a reinforced toe cap for protection and a multidirectional tread pattern on the outsole for improved traction. The inner lining is usually synthetic with moisture-wicking properties to keep your feet dry during extended wear. 


### What sizes are available?

Standard Grant Stone Boots typically come in sizes 7-13 for men and 6-12 for women, with half-sizes available in most common sizes. Custom sizing is not offered, but the company provides sizing charts on their website to help determine the right fit. 

Specialty models, such as those with extra-wide or narrow fits, may have limited size options. Always measure your feet before ordering to ensure the best possible fit.

### Can these boots be worn with socks?

Yes, Grant Stone Boots are designed to work well with both dress socks and athletic socks. The boot cut typically falls between ankle and knee height, with enough room for one or two pairs of socks depending on your preference. 

The synthetic lining helps prevent sock slippage, while the high/boot cut design provides additional warmth and protection from the elements. 


### How should I care for my Grant Stone Boots?

Regular maintenance helps preserve the appearance and longevity of your Grant Stone Boots. Use a soft cloth to wipe away dirt and dust after each wear, and apply a leather protector spray to the upper leather to prevent water damage. 

For detailed instructions specific to your boot model, refer to the care guide included with your purchase. Professional cleaning may be necessary for heavily soiled boots; check local shoe repair shops for options.

### What are the weight characteristics of these boots?

Grant Stone Boots strike a balance between weight and comfort, typically ranging from 2 to 3 pounds per boot depending on the model. The use of lightweight materials in the construction helps reduce overall weight without compromising durability. 

Boots with additional features like internal padding or reinforced toes may be slightly heavier, making them suitable for more extended wear and demanding conditions. 


### Are these boots suitable for cold weather?

While Grant Stone Boots excel in moderate to cool temperatures, their insulating properties vary by model. The synthetic linings provide basic warmth, making them suitable for casual cold-weather activities or short excursions in cool conditions. 

For extended cold-weather use, consider models with thicker insulation, insulated linings, or additional weather-resistant features like rubber toe caps and water-resistant finishes.
