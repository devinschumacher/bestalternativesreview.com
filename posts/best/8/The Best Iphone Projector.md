An iPhone projector allows you to display the contents of your iPhone on a larger screen, making movies, presentations, and photos more engaging. When selecting an iPhone projector, consider several key factors to ensure you choose the right device for your needs. 


### Resolution and Image Quality

Look for a projector with a high native resolution, such as 1080p or 4K, for sharp and detailed images. Consider the projector's light output (measured in lumens) to determine how bright the image will be under different viewing conditions. A higher light output is essential in well-lit rooms or outdoors.
