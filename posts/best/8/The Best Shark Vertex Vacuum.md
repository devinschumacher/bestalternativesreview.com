## Buyer's Guide

When selecting a Shark Vertex vacuum, several key features and specifications will significantly impact its performance and versatility. Understanding these aspects will help you choose the right model to meet your cleaning needs. 


### Suction Power and Cleaning Performance

The motor and filtration system determine the vacuum's suction power and cleaning efficiency. Look for models with powerful motors rated for high suction and efficient filtration to effectively pick up dust, pet hair, and small particles. 


### Attachments and Accessories

Variety of attachments allows vacuums to clean different surfaces and reach tight spaces. Essential accessories include motorized brushes for pet hair, crevice tools for corners, and dusting brushes for delicate items. 


### Capacity and Maintenance

Bagless canister design is convenient for emptying and maintaining. Check the filter washability and motor maintenance requirements. Higher capacity dust cans allow for extended cleaning sessions before emptying.

Handle design and weight distribution affect user comfort. Look for models with flexible hose designs and comfortable grip areas. Rear wheels or swivel casters improve maneuverability, especially for heavier vacuums.
