### How should I use Ryse Protein?

For best results, mix 30 grams (1 scoop) of Ryse with 12-16 ounces of water, milk, or your favorite liquid. Blend thoroughly for optimal digestion and absorption. 

You can consume it immediately before or after workouts, or any time you need a protein boost throughout the day. 


### Are there any flavor options?

Ryse offers their protein powder in unflavored form only, which allows users to customize their taste experience with natural ingredients like vanilla extract, cinnamon, or in-season fruits. 

While unflavored, the brown rice protein has a slightly grainy texture that some may notice when blending with other liquids.
