![Continuous-Recording-Security-Cameras-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Continuous-Recording-Security-Cameras-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a continuous recording security camera?

Continuous recording security cameras continuously monitor and record video footage without interruption. They provide coverage 24/7, ensuring that you never miss a moment and can review events anytime. 

These cameras are ideal for locations that require constant surveillance, such as homes, businesses, or properties with high-security needs. Their reliable recording capabilities help deter crime and provide clear evidence for security purposes. 


### How do continuous recording security cameras differ from other types?

Unlike event-triggered cameras that only record when motion is detected, continuous recording cameras provide uninterrupted video coverage. This means you receive a complete log of events without missing any footage. 

Other types, like those with time-lapse recording, take still photos at set intervals rather than providing continuous video. Continuous recording cameras offer the most comprehensive monitoring solution available.
