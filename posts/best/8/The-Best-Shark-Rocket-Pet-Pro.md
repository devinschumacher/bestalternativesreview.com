## Buyer's Guide

The Shark Rocket Pet Pro represents a popular category of pet-friendly vacuum cleaners designed to clean both pet hair and general household dirt effectively. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you choose the right vacuum for your cleaning needs. 


### Suction Power and Suction Control

Effective pet hair removal requires robust suction. Look for models with adjustable suction control that allows you to increase power where needed, such as over furniture or pet bedding. Higher voltage motors provide stronger suction but may be louder. 


### Attachments and Accessories

Pet-specific attachments like motorized brushes and crevice tools are essential for removing hair from deep fabrics and narrow spaces. The wand and hose should be easily adjustable and include features like anti-tangle brushes to prevent hair buildup. 


### Bagging Systems

The vacuum's bagging system affects both performance and maintenance. Bagged systems separate pet hair from general dust, making it easier to compost or dispose of. Bagless models with disposable canisters prevent leakage and make emptying simple. 


### Size and Portability

Consider the vacuum's weight and whether it folds or detaches for easier storage. For pet owners with multiple floors, a lightweight model with strong suction can simplify daily cleaning routines.
