## Buyer's Guide

Cute cat towers combine stylish design with practicality, offering feline friends vertical space to lounge, play, and sharpen their claws. Understanding key features and considerations will help you select a tower that matches your cat's needs and your home's layout. 


### Height and Space Requirements

Standard cat towers range from 3 to 6 feet tall, though some exotic cat breeds may need towers up to 8 feet high. Consider your space: cats need approximately 18 inches of clearance on all sides of the tower. Multi-level designs with open platforms allow cats to move between floors safely. 


### Tower Design and Structure

Look for towers with wide, stable bases and sturdy construction, such as those with wood or metal frames. Cats prefer towers with hidden storage for scratch mats and toys. Different levels can include beds, perches, and ledges to keep cats entertained and active. 


### Materials and Safety

Opt for materials that are both attractive and secure, like solid wood or reinforced plastic. Avoid toxic materials such as treated wood or loose fabric attachments. The surface should have appropriate texture for clawing, but be smooth enough to prevent scratches on furniture. 


### Additional Features

Look for towers that incorporate vertical scratching surfaces and horizontal rest platforms. Some designs include cat doors or hidden storage for toys and treats. Consider the tower's appearance in your room - it should complement your decor while providing essential vertical space for your cat. 


## FAQ


### What is a cat tower?

A cat tower is a multi-level vertical structure specifically designed for indoor cats. These towers provide enclosed resting spots, climbing routes, and sometimes include built-in toys, but their primary function is to give cats safe, elevated areas to perch and observe their surroundings. 

Common features include smooth or textured surfaces for clawing, sturdy bases, and open or enclosed sections for hiding and resting. Towers come in various sizes and styles, from straightforward posts to complex multi-tiered structures with multiple entry points. 


### How tall should a cat tower be?

The ideal height depends on your specific cat's age, size, and energy level. Young kittens and toy breeds may benefit from towers that range between 3 to 4 feet tall, while larger cats might prefer towers that reach 6 to 7 feet or more. 

For multi-story homes, consider towers that reach about 75% of your home's ceiling height to ensure the cat can see and reach all areas of the home. Shorter towers (2-3 feet) can serve as useful resting spots in smaller spaces or for older, less active cats. 


### What materials are used in cat towers?

Most affordable cat towers are made from particle board or MDF with painted surfaces, which can hide scratches and stains. Higher-end options often feature solid wood construction, metal frames with padded steps, or composite materials designed for both durability and scratch resistance. 

Some towers include synthetic fabrics or plush elements for comfort, while others maintain a sleek, contemporary design with no soft furnishings. Always check the material composition for both structural integrity and scratch resistance when selecting a tower. 


### How much space is needed around a cat tower?

Measure your available wall space before purchasing a tower, as most need at least 2 feet of clear space around each side to prevent tipping and ensure proper balance. The tower's base should be stable and centered in the available space. 

Consider the cat's mobility when placing the tower. It should be within easy reach of common activity areas but not near windows or doors where drafts might affect stability. Ensure there's enough room for your cat to exit the tower safely if needed. 


### Can multiple cats use the same tower?

While many cats enjoy shared elevated spaces, cat towers can become highly territorial, especially if fighting over prime resting spots occurs. Multi-cat households should provide at least one tower per cat plus one additional tower. 

When introducing a new cat to an existing tower, monitor interactions closely. Provide separate access points and consider getting different towers in different locations to reduce competition. 


### How do you clean a cat tower?

Regular maintenance includes gently wiping down surfaces with a damp cloth to remove dust and loose dirt. The base and hidden corners should be vacuumed monthly to remove hair and debris. 

Inspect the tower for loose parts, worn materials, or damaged surfaces weekly. Replace scratched or broken elements promptly to prevent injury and maintain structural integrity.
