## FAQ


### What makes Ugg clogs unique?

Ugg clogs combine iconic Australian craftsmanship with premium footwear technology. These indoor shoes feature genuine Australian shearling inner linings for warmth and comfort, while the durable rubber outsoles provide excellent traction. The classic Ugg design includes a flexible leather upper and a signature step-in heel design, making them ideal for both casual wear and home use. 

These clogs typically offer a generous fit, with many styles available in multiple widths. The premium construction and attention to detail help these shoes maintain their quality over time, though they may not be suitable for outdoor activities due to their indoor-centric design. 


### How should I size Ugg clogs?

Ugg clogs tend to run slightly large, so it's recommended to size down from your usual shoe size. For example, if you typically wear a women's size 7, try a size 6 Ugg clog. These shoes have extra width and room, so it's important to choose a size that allows for natural foot movement. 

Measure your foot from heel to toe and add about a half-inch for proper comfort. Size up if you have a wider foot or prefer extra room, and consider your intended use – larger sizes may be more comfortable for extended use or for people with wider feet. 


### What are the key features to consider when selecting an Ugg clog style?

The durability of the rubber outsole and the quality of the shearling lining are crucial for maintaining comfort and warmth. Premium styles often feature genuine Australian shearling and reinforced stitching, while budget options might use synthetic materials or thinner shearling. The sole design affects both grip and longevity – deeper grooves typically provide better traction. 

Consider the specific style elements that matter most to you. Some people prioritize the classic look of traditional Ugg styles, while others prefer modern options with updated designs. The heel height and upper material (leather vs. suede) can also significantly impact both comfort and appearance. 


### How do Ugg clogs compare to indoor slippers?

Unlike most indoor slippers, Ugg clogs offer a more structured design with a leather upper and a step-in heel. This provides better stability and support during movement, though it may take some getting used to. The premium construction and genuine shearling lining set Ugg clogs apart from basic slippers in terms of warmth and durability. 

Indoor slippers typically provide more generous room and a softer feel underfoot, making them more relaxed for everyday wear. Ugg clogs bridge the gap between casual indoor footwear and outdoor-friendly shoes, offering a stylish compromise for home use. 


### Are Ugg clogs suitable for people with foot issues?

The generous toe box and flexible leather upper make Ugg clogs generally comfortable for most foot types. However, if you have narrow feet or specific medical conditions, the extra room might feel too loose. People with diabetes or reduced foot sensation should consult with a podiatrist before wearing any new footwear. 

The deep heel cup and shearling lining can help support arches and provide additional cushioning. However, individuals with high arches or flat feet might want to explore options with more structured arch support. Proper sizing and selecting a style with reinforced stitching can help ensure these clogs are suitable for your specific foot needs. 


### How should I care for my Ugg clogs?

Regular cleaning involves wiping the leather upper with a damp cloth and patting dry. The shearling lining should be vacuumed weekly to remove dust and debris. For deeper cleaning, remove the insole and wash it according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually by hand with mild soap and water. 

Store your Ugg clogs in a cool, dry place when not in use to prevent mildew. Consider using shoe trees to maintain their shape, especially if you're not wearing them daily. If the rubber outsole shows signs of wear, consider having it professionally refurbished to restore grip and longevity.
