The brand emphasizes sustainability and eco-friendliness, using recyclable packaging and cruelty-free formulas. This sets them apart from many mainstream shampoo brands that prioritize convenience over environmental considerations. 


### How long does a bottle of Eva NYC Shampoo last?

Most Eva NYC shampoo bottles contain 12 ounces, which generally lasts between 6 to 8 weeks for regular daily use. This duration can vary based on the volume of hair and frequency of washing. 

To extend the life of your bottle, consider using it twice daily instead of every day. This helps preserve the product's effectiveness and reduce waste.

### Do these shampoos leave residue in hair?

Most users report that Eva NYC Shampoo rinses out easily without leaving any residue or buildup. The natural ingredients help ensure that hair feels clean and healthy after use.
