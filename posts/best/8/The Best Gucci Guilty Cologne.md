## FAQ

![Gucci-Guilty-Cologne-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Gucci-Guilty-Cologne-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is Gucci Guilty Cologne?

Gucci Guilty Cologne is a bold, captivating fragrance that introduced the world to the Gucci Guilty collection in 2010. The scent blends fresh bergamot with earthy vetiver, creating an unforgettable olfactory signature. 

Each bottle features the iconic Gucci Guilty design, with a distinctive green bottle that has become a signature of the brand's luxury perfumery line. 


### How does Gucci Guilty Cologne compare to other Gucci fragrances?

Gucci Guilty Cologne stands out in the Gucci fragrance portfolio with its distinctive blend of citrus and woody notes. It's more bold and less feminine compared to fragrances like Gucci Bloom, which focuses on floral accords. 

The intensity and longevity of Gucci Guilty Cologne make it suitable for daytime wear, while its complexity allows it to develop beautifully throughout the day. 

![Gucci-Guilty-Cologne-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Gucci-Guilty-Cologne-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the top notes in Gucci Guilty Cologne?

The top notes in Gucci Guilty Cologne include fresh bergamot and grapefruit, creating an immediate burst of zesty energy when the bottle is opened. 

These uplifting citrus notes lead into more complex accords, making each spray an experience rather than just a fragrance. 


### How should Gucci Guilty Cologne be applied?

To get the best results from Gucci Guilty Cologne, apply it to pulse points like your wrists, neck, and behind your ears. These areas have the most active sweat glands and will help the scent develop and last throughout the day. 

Use approximately 1-2 sprays for daytime wear, and consider a second application after 2-3 hours to maintain your signature scent. 

![Gucci-Guilty-Cologne-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Gucci-Guilty-Cologne-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is the alcohol content in Gucci Guilty Cologne?

Like all colognes, Gucci Guilty Cologne contains 90% alcohol by volume. This high concentration helps the fragrance evaporate quickly and creates that characteristic "spritz" effect when applied. 

The alcohol acts as a solvent, allowing the aromatic compounds to blend and develop their full character while ensuring the scent lasts longer on the skin. 


### How long does Gucci Guilty Cologne last?

Due to its high alcohol content, Gucci Guilty Cologne typically lasts between 4-6 hours on the skin. The intensity of the fragrance decreases as the top notes dissipate, revealing the heart and base notes underneath. 

Reapplication may be necessary depending on your skin type and the intensity you prefer, but the longevity of the scent usually means it lasts through a full workday or social event.
