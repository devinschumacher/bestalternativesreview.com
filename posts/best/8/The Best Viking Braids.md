## Buyer's Guide

Viking braids represent a fascinating fusion of history and style, combining ancient techniques with modern interpretations. Understanding the key elements of Viking braids helps in selecting the right style and materials for both enthusiasts and recreators. 


### Materials and Tools

Quality materials are crucial for authentic Viking braids. Traditional braids often used twisted wool yarns, which can be challenging to work with for beginners. Modern alternatives like cotton or synthetic fabrics offer better manageability while maintaining historical accuracy. Essential tools include simple scissors, comb, and optionally, a knitting needle to help manipulate the yarn.

### Historical Accuracy

Researching authentic Viking braiding techniques helps in achieving historical accuracy. Examining archaeological findings and historical texts provides insights into the materials and methods used during the Viking era.

Viking braids can be adapted to suit most hair types, from fine to thick hair. However, individuals with very fine or damaged hair may need to use specific techniques or products to prevent breakage. 

Curly or coily hair types may require more specialized braiding techniques to achieve similar results, and some may find the process more challenging due to hair texture. 


### What's the best way to maintain Viking braids?

Regular maintenance is essential to keep Viking braids looking their best. This includes daily check-ins to ensure the braids remain in place and to identify any loose sections, re-braiding every 3-4 days, and regular cleaning of the braids and scalp. 

Using a gentle shampoo and conditioning routine, avoiding tight hats or head coverings, and minimizing exposure to harsh chemicals or heat treatments will help preserve the integrity of the braids.
