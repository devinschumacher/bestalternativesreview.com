## Buyer's Guide

The right under cabinet microwave can transform your kitchen functionality while keeping your countertop clear. These compact appliances balance powerful performance with clever design elements, making them a practical choice for modern kitchens. 


### Size and Installation

Measure your cabinet interior before purchasing to ensure a proper fit. Standard widths range from 15 to 24 inches, with depths between 12 and 16 inches. Consider your cabinet's dimensions and door hinges to prevent installation issues. 


### Powertouse and Cooking Capabilities

Power levels typically range from 700 to 1200 watts, with higher wattage offering faster cooking times. Check for features like even-heat rotation, convection cooking, and defrost settings to match your cooking needs. 


### Eco-Friendly Options

Look for microwaves with energy-efficient ratings and precise power controls. Some models feature automatic power adjustment based on food type and volume, reducing energy consumption without compromising performance. 


### Additional Considerations

Choose a microwave with easy-to-clean surfaces and dishwasher-safe components. Consider features like precise temperature control, multiple cooking modes, and USB charging ports for convenience. Read reviews to find a model with reliable customer satisfaction and lasting performance. 


## FAQ


### What is the minimum cabinet clearance required for an under cabinet microwave?

Standard under cabinet microwaves need at least 6-8 inches of clearance above the unit for venting and air circulation. Ensure there's at least 4 inches of space on either side and 2 inches behind the unit for proper ventilation and electrical clearance. 

Cabinets with shallower depths (15 inches or less) may require specific clearance specifications. Always check your cabinet measurements against the manufacturer's minimum clearance requirements before installation. 


### How do I measure for an under cabinet microwave?

Measure the cabinet's interior dimensions, including height, width, and depth. Add 1/8 inch to the height measurement for accurate alignment. Note any obstacles like water pipes or electrical outlets that could affect installation or usage. 

Check for levelness by placing the microwave or a level on the cabinet's countertop surface. Uneven surfaces can affect microwave performance and safety. Adjust cabinet supports or counter height as needed before installation. 


### What features should I consider when choosing an under cabinet microwave?

Look for models with at least 1200 watts of power for effective heating. Features like convection cooking, built-in defrost programs, and multiple cooking modes enhance cooking versatility. Self-cleaning, child-lock, and pause functions add convenience and safety. 

Size options range from compact 1.1 cubic feet to larger 1.7 cubic feet. Consider your food storage needs and cabinet space limitations when selecting the appropriate size. Some models include LED display screens for easier operation. 


### Can an under cabinet microwave be used as a regular kitchen microwave?

Yes, the primary function of an under cabinet microwave remains regular kitchen microwave use. They perform all standard microwave functions like defrosting, reheating, and popcorn popping. 

However, their smaller size and specific cabinet installation requirements make them ideal for limited countertop space. They retain full functionality but may have slightly different programming options compared to larger countertop models. 


### What is the average lifespan of an under cabinet microwave?

With proper use and maintenance, under cabinet microwaves typically last between 8-10 years. Factors affecting longevity include usage frequency, cleaning habits, and adherence to manufacturer guidelines. 

The magnetron, a critical component, usually determines the microwave's lifespan. Quality microwaves with robust construction and reliable components maintain optimal performance throughout their service life. 


### Are under cabinet microwaves safe to use?

Like conventional microwave ovens, under cabinet microwaves are safe when used properly. Always keep food containers away from the edges to prevent them from sliding into the rotating turntable mechanism. 

Follow manufacturer guidelines for microwaveable cookware compatibility. Only use utensils specifically designed for microwave use and avoid metal objects that can cause sparks and damage the microwave.
