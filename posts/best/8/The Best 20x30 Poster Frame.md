## Buyer's Guide

A 20x30 poster frame displays larger-than-life images with professional-grade quality. This guide helps you select the right frame, considering factors like size compatibility, mounting options, and protective features. 


### Size and Compatibility

Ensure the frame's internal dimensions match your poster's print size. Standard 20x30 frames have a slightly larger opening to allow for matting and mounting. Check the frame's specifications for exact measurements. 


### Mounting and Installation

Two common mounting options are frames with hanging hardware and frames that attach to walls. Consider how the frame will be hung - indoor display requires simpler hardware, while outdoor use demands weather-resistant materials. 


### Protection Features

Look for frames with UV protection to prevent fading, and acid-free backing materials to preserve your print's quality. Some frames include adjustable mounts for varying wall angles, while others feature reinforced corners for stability. 


### Style and Finish

Popular finishes include matte black, silver, and gold, which complement most decor styles. Consider the frame's visual weight - slim profiles work best in minimalist spaces, while ornate designs suit traditional interiors.
