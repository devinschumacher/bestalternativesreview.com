The 300-thread-count percale weave pairs the natural benefits of organic cotton with enhanced strength and durability, lasting longer than standard percale sheets. 


### What are the environmental benefits of Cozy Earth sheets?

### How do Cozy Earth sheets perform with frequent washing?

Organic cotton, especially Pima cotton, maintains its softness and shape well even with frequent washing. The 300-thread-count weave structure holds up better than lower-count sheets, resisting pill formation and maintaining smoothness. 

Our sheets retain their color vibrancy and shape through regular use, with proper care including cold washes and gentle detergents to maintain their quality. 


### What makes Cozy Earth sheets hypoallergenic?
