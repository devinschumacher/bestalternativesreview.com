## Buyer's Guide

A floating trampoline offers a unique and exhilarating way to enjoy the bounce, with the thrill of being on water. These floating playgrounds combine the fun of trampolining with the excitement of water activities, creating an unforgettable experience for both kids and adults. To help you choose the right floating trampoline, consider the following essential factors. 


### Capacity and Size

The maximum recommended weight capacity determines how many people can safely use the trampoline at once. Common capacities range from 330 to 880 pounds, depending on the model. Consider the size of your pool and expected user load when selecting a trampoline. The pool diameter should be at least 10 feet larger than the trampoline's width for proper floating and safety. 


### Stability and Anchoring

Proper anchoring is crucial for a floating trampoline's stability. Most models come with weight-resistant mooring lines that attach to the pool's edges. Ensure your pool has a firm, level edge that can support these lines without shifting. Look for features like anchor weights or additional attachment points that increase stability in various pool environments. 


### Material Quality

The trampoline's construction materials affect both its durability and safety. The floating base should be made from high-density foam with a water-resistant coating. The springs and safety padding require premium quality to prevent wear and tear during regular use. Higher-priced models often feature reinforced stitching and durable UV protection to extend the trampoline's lifespan. 


### Maintenance Requirements

Regular maintenance ensures your floating trampoline remains safe and functional. Consider the ease of basic upkeep tasks like cleaning, air check, and spring inspection. Some models feature sealed spring enclosures that simplify maintenance, while others require more frequent attention to prevent corrosion and wear. Easy access to important components typically correlates with lower maintenance requirements. 


## FAQ


### What size floating trampoline is right for me?

The ideal floating trampoline size depends on your space and how you plan to use it. For compact spaces or regular backyard use, a 12 feet diameter trampoline is suitable. Larger families or those with extensive poolside space may prefer a 14 feet or 16 feet model for more room to jump. 

Consider your pool's dimensions when choosing a trampoline. Allow at least 4 feet of clearance around the trampoline's edge for safety. You'll also want enough water surface area for proper floatation - each 12 feet trampoline needs about 15 feet by 15 feet of pool space. 


### How do I properly set up a floating trampoline?

First, choose a calm pool with minimal waves and no currents. Position the trampoline in deep water (at least 7 feet) far from pool equipment and steps. Inflate the trampoline with a pump and attach the legs to the floaters using the provided clips. 

Always check the water level regularly while using the trampoline. If the water level drops more than an inch, compensate by adding water or air until it's back to the marked fill line on the floaters. Wind and waves may require periodic readjustment of the legs' height. 


### How long do floating trampolines last?

Properly maintained, a floating trampoline can last 3-5 years with regular use. The key factors are regular cleaning to prevent water damage, proper storage when not in use, and avoiding harsh weather conditions. 

Check the trampoline monthly for signs of wear, such as weakening floaters or damaged clips. Replace any damaged parts promptly to prevent leaks or instability. If you live in a region with extreme seasonal temperature changes, consider storing the unit indoors during off-season. 


### What maintenance is required for a floating trampoline?

Regular maintenance keeps your floating trampoline safe and functional. At the end of each use or weekly, check all clips and straps for proper connection and tighten any loose parts. Once a month, clean the trampoline with a mild detergent and hose. 

If you live in a hot climate or have hard water, consider applying a protective coating to the floaters every 6 months to extend their lifespan and maintain their bounce. Store the trampoline indoors in a dry place during winter months to prevent damage from cold weather and direct sunlight. 


### How many people can use a floating trampoline at once?

Manufacturers typically recommend limiting use to one person at a time for safety. This allows proper weight distribution and maintains even floatation across the trampoline surface. 

In terms of size capacity, avoid filling the trampoline beyond its recommended weight limit (usually around 120-200 lbs per 12 feet model). Using it within these limits ensures a safe and fun experience for all users. 


### Are floating trampolines safe for older kids and adults?

Yes, floating trampolines are suitable for older children and adults when used properly. However, they should always be supervised by an adult while in use to prevent accidents. 

Due to their size and weight limitations, only one person should jump at a time. Always use proper safety equipment, including approved pads and safety lines. Regular maintenance and proper setup are essential for maintaining a safe environment.
