## Buyer's Guide

Alfred Sung perfumes blend contemporary style with classic fragrance formulas. When selecting an Alfred Sung scent, consider factors like scent longevity, base notes, and personal preference. Understanding these elements helps you choose a fragrance that matches your personality and occasions. 


### Scent Longevity

Perfume longevity affects how noticeable the fragrance is throughout the day. Higher concentration perfumes like parfums last longer (6-8 hours), while eau de toilettes last 3-5 hours. Consider your daily activities and whether you want a signature scent or something more subtle.

### Top Notes

Top notes are the first scents you detect, lasting about 15 minutes. They often include fresh elements like citrus, mint, or green notes. Choose top notes that complement your skin type and personal preference. Rosy, spicy, or fruity top notes generate immediate interest.
