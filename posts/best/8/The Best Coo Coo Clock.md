The clock chimes "coo coo" once for each hour passed and adds a second "coo coo" for each quarter-hour. For example, at 3:15, it will sound "coo coo" three times followed by a second "coo coo. "


### What are the key features of a Coo Coo Clock?

Modern Coo Coo Clocks offer accurate timekeeping with an analog display, adjustable hourly and quarter-hour chimes, and some feature night mode to reduce nighttime noise. Most models include a battery backup to maintain time during power outages. 

The clocks typically have a height between 12-18 inches, with a width ranging from 6-9 inches. They require minimal counter space while adding character to any kitchen or dining room.

### How does the sound work?

The "coo coo" sound is produced by a mechanical mechanism that counts the hours and quarters. A series of gears and a metal hammer strike a resonant metal bar to create the distinctive sound.

While battery-powered models may need occasional replacement of the internal power source, the mechanical components typically last much longer than electronic alternatives. Regular cleaning of the chime mechanism helps maintain consistent sound quality. 


### How should I care for my Coo Coo Clock?

Regular maintenance involves dusting the clock face and mechanism once a month, and cleaning the metal chime bar with a soft cloth to remove tarnish. The battery backup should be checked annually to ensure it maintains the clock's time during power outages. 

Store the clock away from direct sunlight and extreme temperature changes to prevent damage to the mechanism. Most manufacturers recommend occasional lubrication of the movement every 5-7 years, though this should be done by a professional.
