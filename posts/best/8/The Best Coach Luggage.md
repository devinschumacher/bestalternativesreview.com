## Buyer's Guide

Coach luggage combines style, functionality, and affordability, making it a popular choice for travelers. Understanding key features will help you select a suitcase that matches your needs and preferences. 


### Size and Shape

Coach offers various sizes, from compact carry-ons to oversized suitcases. Consider your needs: small sizes are ideal for short trips, while larger options provide more space for extended stays. The shape affects packing ease - rectangular suitcases maximize space, while cylindrical ones can be easier to push through airports. 


### Material and Construction

The outer material should resist scuffs and scratches. Coach uses durable polyester and canvas, which hold up well to regular use. Look for reinforced corners and double-stitched seams to ensure longevity. The interior should have multiple compartments and organizational features like pockets and straps to keep your items tidy. 


### Weight and Rollability

Coach luggage ranges from lightweight options for frequent flyers to heavier, more robust suitcases. Rollers with 4 wheels (2 front, 2 back) provide smooth movement, while 6-wheeled models offer even better traction. The handle should be well-padded for comfortable carrying, especially on longer trips. 


### Features and Accessories

Add-ons like built-in USB ports for charging devices, TSA-approved locks for security, and matching travel pouches for protection can enhance your experience. Consider a suitcase with wheels that lock into place when pulled to prevent accidental movement while in use. 


## FAQ


### What is Coach luggage made of?

Coach luggage features a durable construction with multiple layers of reinforced leather, combined with water-resistant polyester for protection against spills and scratches. The interiors include padded laptop sleeves and organizational pockets designed to keep your belongings secure and accessible. 

Each piece undergoes rigorous quality control to maintain the brand's signature look of polished nickel hardware and expertly sewn double-stitch seams, ensuring longevity and reliability for your travel needs. 


### How should I maintain Coach luggage?

Regular care for your Coach luggage includes wiping down the exterior with a gentle cleaner after each use to remove dirt and prevent scratches. For the leather portions, apply a conditioning leather balm every 6 months to maintain its supple texture and appearance. 

Avoid exposing the luggage to direct sunlight, extreme temperatures, or strong chemicals. Store it in a cool, dry place when not in use and consider using the included protective covers during long-term storage to prevent dust and damage. 


### What sizes are available in Coach luggage?

Coach offers a range of sizes for both carry-on and checked luggage, typically including small, medium, and large options for both suitcases and backpacks. The specific dimensions vary by style, so it's important to verify the measurements that match your travel requirements. 

Most Coach luggage pieces feature an expandable design that allows you to increase the size by a few inches when needed, giving you flexibility in packing for different trips. 


### How much does Coach luggage cost?

Coach luggage pricing varies depending on the style, size, and features of the piece. A basic carry-on suitcase typically ranges from $300 to $400, while larger suitcases and backpacks can cost between $500 and $700. 

Special editions, limited releases, and designer collaborations often carry a premium price point exceeding $1,000, making them a significant investment in your travel collection. 


### What colors are available in Coach luggage?

Coach offers a broad spectrum of color options for their luggage, ranging from classic black and brown leather to vibrant reds, blues, and greens. Each season, they introduce new colorways that blend with their evolving fashion collections. 

The brand's signature "Natural Tan" brown color is a popular choice for its versatile appeal, while their "Navy Blue" and "Dark Red" options add a sophisticated touch to any travel wardrobe. 


### Are Coach luggage pieces resistant to water damage?

Coach luggage incorporates water-resistant technology in their polyester lining to protect the inner contents from light water exposure. The water-resistant coating helps prevent spills and rain penetration, but it's not suitable for submersion in water or prolonged exposure to moisture. 

For heavier water protection, consider the Coach Splashproof collection, which features a more extensive water-resistant barrier between the outer shell and inner lining, providing better protection for your travel documents and electronics.
