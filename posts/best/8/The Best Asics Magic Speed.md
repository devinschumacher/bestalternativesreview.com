## Buyer's Guide

The Asics Magic Speed shoes combine performance features with modern design, making them a popular choice for runners seeking responsive energy return and precise foot placement. When selecting your pair, consider several key aspects to ensure you find the right model for your running style and goals. 


### Footstrike Compatibility

The Magic Speed series features a neutral tendency, which works well for both neutral and mild overpronators. The series includes models optimized for different footstrike patterns - the Magic Speed 7 and 9 have a more flexible ride suitable for forefoot or midfoot strike runners, while the Magic Speed 11 offers slightly more cushioning for those with a heel-toe running pattern. 


### Ultralight Construction

The primary material in Asics Magic Speed shoes is a proprietary foam compound that balances light weight with springy responsiveness. The upper uses a minimalist mesh construction with strategic overlays for support. Shoe-to-foot interface is designed to reduce bulk and maximize feel. Look for versions with the lightest construction if you prioritize ultra-low weight in your running footwear. 


### Sensor Technology

Asics incorporates specialized sensors in the Magic Speed series to track running form and performance. These capture data on stride length, cadence, and ground contact time. The footstrike sensor helps identify your specific running pattern and measures transition efficiency. Consider a pair with advanced sensor technology if you're analytical about your running biomechanics. 


### Fit Considerations

Asics recommends ordering your regular running shoe size in the Magic Speed series. The toe box offers moderate width with room for natural toe splay, while the heel counter provides lockdown without being overly constrictive. The mesh upper allows excellent ventilation but note that the shoe can feel tight initially - give it an extra day of break-in compared to other running shoes. 


## FAQ


### What makes Asics Magic Speed shoes different from other running shoes?

Asics Magic Speed shoes incorporate advanced technologies like FlyteFoam Propel for maximum energy return and UltraFly construction for enhanced support. Unlike traditional trainers, these shoes prioritize explosive power through their lightweight and responsive design. 

The unique GEL cushioning in key impact zones offers superior shock absorption, while the lightweight construction reduces overall weight. This combination sets Magic Speed shoes apart from basic running footwear. 


### How do I determine the right size for Asics Magic Speed shoes?

To find your perfect size, measure the longest part of your foot and compare it to the shoe's length specifications. Add at least a thumb's width of space between your longest toe and the end of the shoe for proper fit. 

Consider trying them on later in the day when your feet might be slightly swollen. Also, ensure there's enough room for your toes to move freely, particularly when sprinting. 


### What surface is best for wearing Asics Magic Speed shoes?

These shoes excel on dry, flat surfaces suitable for indoor track or outdoor synthetic tracks. While capable of occasional road use, their specific design makes them less optimal for regular pavement running. 

Avoid uneven terrain or trails, as the specialized energy return system is optimized for consistent surface contact. The shoes perform best on smooth, specialized tracks designed for sprinting and high-speed running. 


### How should I break in my new Asics Magic Speed shoes?

Start by wearing them for short, low-impact activities like walking or light jogging to allow your feet to get accustomed to the new footwear. Gradually increase your intensity and duration over 1-2 weeks. 

Check for any discomfort or unusual pressure points daily. If you experience persistent soreness, consider wearing them for shorter periods or try a different shoe model to see if the issue persists. 


### What's the return policy for Asics Magic Speed shoes?

Asics typically offers a 30-day return window for unopened items, while opened footwear usually has a 90-day return period. Shoes must be in original condition with no visible wear or damage. 

Specific policies may vary by retailer, so check your receipt or online purchase confirmation for exact details. Damaged or defective items can usually be returned or exchanged for a replacement. 


### How long do Asics Magic Speed shoes typically last?

With proper use and care, a pair of Asics Magic Speed shoes typically lasts 6-12 months for competitive runners. Regular runners might find them durable for 300-500 miles, while casual users could get 600-800 miles. 

Signs that indicate it's time for new shoes include noticeable loss of springiness, visible wear patterns on the outsole, or if you experience increased foot pain during runs. Regular visual inspection can help determine when shoes need replacement.
