### [Anne Cole Underwire Surplice Tri Tankini](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Anne+Cole+Swimwear?utm\_term=anne-cole-underwire-surplice-tri-tankini)

![Anne Cole Underwire Surplice Tri Tankini | Image](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcT4-cq33JR2a5BgvoEkK9WtwXUH201cLXoLWoamj1K0rmQS7\_4R\_UATRDZ4jbsjc3pNEPyODXjvGk6hsvcBNYa5bgZtEMpm&usqp=CAY)

Crafted from supple 82% nylon blend with built-in underwire, this Anne Cole tankini offers firm support while the removable padding lets you customize the fit. The clever surplice design cinches in the waist for a flattering silhouette, though some find the cups sit at an odd angle. The pull-on closure and adjustable straps make it practical for everyday wear, but note that it tends to ride up without additional coverage. The moss green color looks gorgeous in person, though sizing runs a bit small with many reporting it needs to be ordered larger for proper fit.

## Buyer's Guide

Looking for the perfect swimsuit? The world of beachwear can be overwhelming, but our guide will help you find a flattering, durable Anne Cole swimwear piece that matches your style and needs. 


### Fit and Sizing

Proper fit makes or breaks a swimsuit, so measure yourself according to your regular bra size before you shop. Anne Cole offers detailed size charts online, which consider both cup size and waist measurement. Keep in mind their garments run slightly small, especially in the bust area. 


### Style and Silhouette

From high-waisted to bikini bottoms, Anne Cole offers a variety of silhouettes. Consider your body type when choosing: high-waisted styles can elongate legs, while lower-rise options might suit larger frames. The brand's signature designs, like the halter neck and wide-leg styles, provide excellent coverage and support. 


### Quality and Construction

The brand uses premium materials like spandex and polyester blends for durability and flexibility. Look for seams that are carefully aligned and stitching that appears neat and precise. Well-made swimsuits should feel smooth against the skin without any snags or loose threads. 


### Maintenance and Care

Proper maintenance keeps your swimsuit looking great and extending its life. Always check the care label, but as a rule, avoid putting wet suits in the dryer. Instead, hang them to air dry or stuff them with towels for quicker drying. Regular washing with mild detergent keeps them fresh and clean between swims. 


## FAQ


### What makes Anne Cole swimwear different from other brands?

Our swimwear combines high-quality fabrics with modern designs, offering both style and durability. Each piece goes through rigorous testing to ensure it maintains its shape and color while providing comfortable, secure fits. 

We're known for our sustainable practices, using recycled materials and minimizing waste in our manufacturing process. This commitment to environmental responsibility doesn't compromise our standards for performance and appearance. 


### What's the best way to care for Anne Cole swimwear?

Hand wash your swimsuit in cold water with a mild soap specifically designed for delicates. Avoid using harsh detergents or bleach as they can damage the fabric. 

Avoid hanging swimwear to dry, as this can stretch the material. Instead, lay it flat on a towel to air dry. If necessary, reshape the swimsuit while it's still damp to maintain its form. 


### What sizes does Anne Cole offer?

Our sizing runs true to fit, with a range from US 2 to 14. For maximum comfort, we recommend measuring your chest and waist to determine your best fit. 

Specialty styles like bikinis may offer additional sizing options. Our plus-size range includes sizes 16-22, with extra length and width available for most pieces. 


### Which swimsuits can I wear in cold water?

Our Quick-Dry styles and thermal suits are specifically designed for cooler water temperatures, providing excellent moisture management and thermal insulation. 

These suits use specialized fabrics that reduce water absorption and maximize warmth, ensuring you stay comfortable in varying water conditions. 


### How do I find the right fit for my body shape?

Refer to our detailed sizing charts and body shape guide available on our website. Each style notes specific measurements for optimal fit based on your bust, waist, and hip measurements. 

If you're between sizes or have an atypical measurement, we recommend ordering the next size up to ensure a secure, flattering fit.
