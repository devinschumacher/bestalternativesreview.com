## FAQ

![Alien-Tape-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Alien-Tape-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is Alien Tape?

Alien Tape is a specialized adhesive tape designed for electronic and industrial applications. It features a strong, durable bonding agent and a flexible backing material that resists tearing and maintains adhesion under various temperature conditions. 

The tape comes in different widths and lengths to accommodate various bonding needs, with common applications including electronic component mounting, cable bundling, and temporary surface protection. 


### What makes Alien Tape different from regular duct tape?

Unlike regular duct tape, Alien Tape is formulated specifically for electronic and industrial use. It has a higher tensile strength and maintains adhesion over a wider temperature range (-50° to 200°C). 

The backing material is more flexible and resistant to tearing, which makes it ideal for applications where traditional duct tape would fail due to stress or movement. 

![Alien-Tape-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Alien-Tape-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What thicknesses are available for Alien Tape?

Alien Tape is available in standard thicknesses ranging from 1.2mm to 1.6mm, providing options for both light-duty and heavy-duty applications. 

The tape comes in rolls with widths typically between 25mm to 76mm, allowing users to select the appropriate size based on their specific needs. 


### How should Alien Tape be stored?

To maintain optimal adhesion properties, store Alien Tape in a dry environment away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures. The recommended storage temperature range is 15° to 30°C. 

Avoid storing the tape near chemical solvents or other materials that could damage the backing or adhesive properties of the tape. 

![Alien-Tape-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Alien-Tape-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What surface preparation is needed before using Alien Tape?

For best results, surfaces should be clean, dry, and free from dust, oils, or other contaminants before applying Alien Tape. Lightly sanding the surface can improve adhesion in some cases. 

Ensure that any primer or surface treatment applied to the substrate has fully cured before bonding with Alien Tape. 


### How long does Alien Tape maintain its adhesive properties?

Alien Tape maintains its adhesive properties for up to 12 months when stored properly. Under ideal storage conditions, it can maintain its performance for up to 18 months. 

The actual bond strength decreases once the tape is removed from the roll, with maximum adhesion achieved within 24 hours of application.
