## FAQ

![Cherry-Pitter-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cherry-Pitter-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What does a cherry pitter do?

A cherry pitter removes the pits from cherries, making them safe and convenient to eat. Professional pitters can process entire bags of cherries in minutes, while manual pitters allow you to remove pits one at a time. 

Some pitters offer options like grinding the pits for cherry pits seasoning or creating cherry pit charcoal, while others include features like interchangeable blades for different cherry sizes. 


### How do you use a cherry pitter?

Place the cherry in the pitter's grip, aligning the fruit's seam with the cutting edge. Apply gentle pressure while the pitter cuts a small slice around the stem end. The pitted cherry will pop out from the base. 

Professional pitters use motorized rotation for efficiency, while manual pitters require manual twisting or pressing. Always clean your pitter regularly to maintain hygiene and cutting performance. 

![Cherry-Pitter-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cherry-Pitter-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the main types of cherry pitters?

The primary types are manual, motorized, and seasonal handheld pitters. Manual pitters range from simple single-use grips to more complex multi-functional devices. 

Motorized pitters offer faster processing but require electricity or batteries. Seasonal handheld pitters are light, portable options for back yard cherry picking. 


### How effective are cherry pitters?

Modern cherry pitters are highly effective, with most models achieving a success rate of 95% or higher. The efficiency varies slightly between manual and motorized models. 

Automatic pitters are particularly effective for cherry growers, processing dozens of cherries per minute. However, the gentle pressure needed to avoid bruising may lead to some pit removal failures. 

![Cherry-Pitter-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cherry-Pitter-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)

For home use, the Chef's Choice Cherry Pitter gets top marks for its precision and durability. It's suitable for all sizes of cherries and has a 10-year warranty. 

Professional kitchen staff prefer the Oster Professional Cherry Pitter, which processes 40 cherries per minute and includes interchangeable blades for different cherry sizes. 


### How long do cherry pitters last?

With regular use and proper maintenance, a quality cherry pitter will last 5-10 years. Manual pitters typically last longer than motorized models due to fewer moving parts. 

To extend your pitter's lifespan, clean it thoroughly after each use and store it in a dry location. Replace blades annually or when they show signs of dullness or wear.
