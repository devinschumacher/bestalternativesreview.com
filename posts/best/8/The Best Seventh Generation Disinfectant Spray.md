## FAQ


### What makes Seventh Generation Disinfectant Spray different from other cleaning products?

Seventh Generation's disinfectant spray combines powerful germ-killing performance with environmentally friendly ingredients. Unlike traditional disinfectants that contain harsh chemicals, this product uses natural enzymes and botanical extracts to destroy viruses and bacteria. 

The formula is completely chemical-free and leaves no residue behind, making it safe for use around food, pets, and children. It's also effective against a wide range of pathogens, including the flu virus andMRSA, while maintaining a clean and fresh scent. 


### Can Seventh Generation Disinfectant Spray be used on all surfaces?

While Seventh Generation's cleaning products are generally versatile, their disinfectant spray has specific surface compatibility requirements. For best results, use it on non-porous surfaces like countertops, doorknobs, and electronic devices. 

Avoid using this product on absorbent materials like paper, cardboard, or untreated wood, as it may damage these surfaces. Always test on a small, hidden area first to ensure the surface can handle the product's active ingredients. 


### How long does the disinfectant spray remain active on surfaces?

The EPA-approved formula kills 99.99% of bacteria and viruses within 5 minutes of application, but it needs to be left on the surface for at least 10 seconds to 3 minutes depending on the type of pathogen. 

Once the recommended dwell time is complete, wipe off the surface with a clean cloth or allow it to air dry. The effectiveness of the product may be reduced if the surface dries out before the specified dwell time is met. 


### Is the Seventh Generation Disinfectant Spray effective against mold and mildew?

The product is specifically formulated to combat mold and mildew, making it suitable for cleaning areas prone to these issues. It effectively kills the spores and eliminates the source of mold and mildew growth. 

However, for heavy infestations or persistent mold problems, you may need to apply the spray more frequently or combine it with proper ventilation and moisture control measures. 


### Can Seventh Generation Disinfectant Spray be used in commercial settings?

The product is EPA-registered for use in commercial facilities, making it suitable for office environments, healthcare settings, and food service establishments. It meets stringent health and safety standards for professional cleaning. 

While it's effective in commercial settings, always follow the manufacturer's instructions and local regulations regarding chemical use in public spaces. Some areas may have specific requirements for the storage and application of disinfectants. 


### How long does the spray last once opened?

The product remains stable for up to 6 months after opening when stored properly. Keep the container tightly closed between uses and store it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat sources. 

If you notice changes in the product's color, odor, or consistency, it's best to replace the bottle. The manufacturer recommends discarding any unused portion after the 6-month period to ensure optimal performance and safety.
