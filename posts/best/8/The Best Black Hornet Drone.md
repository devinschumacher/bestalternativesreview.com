The video includes basic compass and altitude data on-screen, helping the operator maintain control and direction during flight. 


### How maneuverable is the Black Hornet in tight spaces?

The drone's small size and lightweight design make it highly maneuverable in tight spaces and around obstacles. It can fly indoors and through narrow passages, but its battery life is limited to about 15-20 minutes.

### What are the legal considerations for using a Black Hornet drone?

Operating a Black Hornet drone requires basic knowledge of local airspace regulations. Users should avoid flying over crowds, private property without permission, and restricted airspace. 

The drone does not have advanced obstacle avoidance features, so users must exercise caution when flying in complex environments to prevent collisions with trees, buildings, or other obstacles. 


### Can the Black Hornet be used for extended missions?

While the Black Hornet can perform multiple missions in quick succession due to its small size and ease of transport, each flight typically lasts 15-20 minutes. Users must carry spare batteries and be prepared for frequent recharging. 

The drone's primary use is for short-duration missions, such as security surveillance or quick reconnaissance. Its small size and limited flight time make it less suitable for long-term monitoring or complex operations.
