## Buyer's Guide

Exacto knives combine precision cutting with ergonomic design for everyday use. Understanding key features will help you select the right blade for your needs. 


### Blade Style

Exacto blades come in four primary styles: straight, utility, straight utility, and pointed utility. Straight blades offer consistent cutting, while utility blades balance precision with manual dexterity. The straight utility combines straight blade benefits with better grip, and pointed utility blades provide enhanced tip sensitivity for detailed work. 


### Blade Length

Standard blade lengths range from 2 to 4 inches. Shorter blades offer better control for precision work, while longer blades provide more cutting surface for bulk materials. Consider the thickness of materials you'll be cutting when selecting a length. 


### Ergonomic Handle

Handle materials include plastic, metal, and rubber. Plastic handles offer basic grip, while metal handles provide premium feel but less impact resistance. Rubber-coated handles improve grip and reduce hand fatigue, making them ideal for frequent use. 


### Blade Retention

Exacto knives use three primary blade retention systems: liner lock, friction lock, and thumb stud. Liner lock systems activate with a slide along the handle, offering quick blade deployment. Friction lock systems require pushing the blade forward to secure it, providing additional grip. Thumb stud systems unlock by pressing a stud on the handle, requiring manual precision but offering no blade lock. 


## FAQ


### What is an Exacto knife?

An Exacto knife is a precision cutting tool featuring a thin, razor-sharp blade mounted on a handle. It's commonly used in drafting, hobby projects, and professional settings where fine cuts are required. 

The term "Exacto" isn't a brand name but rather a generic term for this type of knife. Multiple manufacturers produce these tools under various names and designs. 


### What makes an Exacto knife different from a utility knife?

Exacto knives typically have longer, thinner blades compared to utility knives, making them more precise for detailed work. They often feature spring-loaded blade locking mechanisms for safer handling. 

Utility knives have more adjustable blade depths and are generally larger, allowing for both precision cuts and heavy-duty slicing tasks. 


### What is the typical blade length of an Exacto knife?

Standard Exacto knife blades measure about 2 to 2.5 inches (50-64 mm) in length, providing a good balance between precision and reach during use. 

Most blade replacement systems allow users to interchange blades of different lengths, from as short as 1.2 inches to longer options for specific tasks. 


### How should an Exacto knife be stored?

When not in use, store the knife blade down to prevent accidental cutting. The handle should be secured in its protective sheath or cover to prevent blade exposure. 

Keep Exacto knives in a secure container or drawer that's out of reach of children and pets to prevent misuse or damage. 


### How do you maintain an Exacto knife blade?

Regularly clean and inspect the blade's cutting edge for nicks or dullness. Most manufacturers recommend professional sharpening rather than attempting DIY sharpening. 

Always store blades in their protective sheaths when not in use and handle them with care to prevent damage to the edge. 


### Are Exacto knives safe for beginners?

Exacto knives can be safer for beginners than traditional box cutters due to their spring-loaded blade locking mechanism, which keeps the blade closed during transport and use. 

However, they still require proper training and supervision for safe handling, especially in professional or educational settings.
