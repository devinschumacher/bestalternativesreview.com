If you're the type who thinks about fragrances the way I think about ocean breezes—expecting layers of salt air and sun-warmed sand—this might not be the Prada for you. But if you're ready to explore what happens when a fashion house decides to push beyond traditional scent boundaries, grab a closer look at this remarkable interpretation of maritime luxury. The initial burst of citrus might surprise you (bergamot's not exactly what I'd expect from a "Black" fragrance), but stick with it and you'll find surprisingly sophisticated depth in those unexpected herbal and vanilla notes. It's not quite the immersive ocean experience I was hoping for, but it's definitely worth a second chance if you're willing to see a perfume through to its unexpected conclusions.
