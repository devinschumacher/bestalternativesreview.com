## Buyer's Guide

A Bissell Pet Pro Carpet Cleaner can significantly improve your pet-friendly home's hygiene by removing stubborn pet stains and odors from carpets. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the right cleaner for your needs. 


### Suction Power and Dirt Collection

The suction capability removes soil and pet hair effectively. Look for models with powerful motors and large dirt containers to reduce frequent emptying. 


### Water Extraction Technology

Effective cleaners use hot water extraction (steam cleaning) to remove soil and kill bacteria while extracting the cleaning solution. Check for precise temperature control and effective water extraction systems. 


### Attached Tools and Accessories

Multiple attachments for upholstery, stairs, and deep cleaning help address different cleaning needs. The included tools should be versatile and easy to switch between. 


### Size, Weight, and Portability

Consider the machine's weight and dimensions for easy maneuverability, especially if you have stairs or narrow doorways. Compact models with good suction can be more practical for pet owners. 


## FAQ


### How effective is the Bissell Pet Pro Carpet Cleaner?

The Bissell Pet Pro Carpet Cleaner effectively removes pet stains and odors using its powerful washing action and hot water extraction. It's particularly effective on pet urine, which is notoriously difficult to remove, thanks to its combination of steam and agitation. 

Independent testing has shown that it significantly reduces pet dander and allergens, making it a practical choice for pet owners who need to maintain a clean and healthy home environment. 


### What makes the Bissell Pet Pro different from other pet carpet cleaners?

The Bissell Pet Pro stands out due to its versatile steam cleaning system, which allows you to choose between hot water extraction, steam cleaning, or a combination of both. This flexibility helps in tackling various soil types and levels of soiling. 

Unlike some other pet-specific cleaners, the Bissell Pet Pro also features a built-in pet hair roller brush attachment, making it more convenient for pet owners who need to clean up hair along with stains. 


### How much does the Bissell Pet Pro cost?

The Bissell Pet Pro typically retails for around $70 to $80, depending on the retailer and any ongoing promotions. This price includes the main cleaner unit, detergent bottle, and pet hair roller brush attachment. 

Considering its durability and effective cleaning capabilities, most users find that the investment in the Bissell Pet Pro provides good value over time. 


### Is it suitable for all types of carpets?

The Bissell Pet Pro is suitable for most residential carpet types, including nylon, polyester, and wool carpets. It's not recommended for use on delicate fabrics, silk, or certain carpet designs that could be damaged by direct steam exposure. 

Always test the cleaner on a small, inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn't cause damage or color changes to your specific carpeting material. 


### How long does it take to clean a carpet with the Bissell Pet Pro?

The cleaning time depends on the size of the carpet and the level of soiling, but a standard room typically takes about 30 minutes to an hour to clean thoroughly. The hot water extraction process requires time for the water to evaporate properly. 

For best results, allow the carpet to completely dry before walking on it, which usually takes several hours to overnight, depending on the room's temperature and humidity levels. 


### What's included in the Bissell Pet Pro package?

The basic package includes the main cleaner unit, detergent bottle, and pet hair roller brush attachment. Additional accessories like extra detergent bottles and replacement parts are available separately. 

Some models also come with a hose attachment for reaching under furniture or into corners, providing even more versatility to the cleaning process.
