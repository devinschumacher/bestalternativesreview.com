### How should Bod colognes be applied?

For optimal results, apply Bod cologne to pulse points like the wrists, inner elbows, and neck. Allow the fragrance to absorb into the skin for best persistence throughout the day. 

Avoid spraying cologne directly onto fabrics or hair, as this can intensify the scent and may cause skin irritation for some users. 


### Can Bod colognes cause skin irritation?

Bod colognes are formulated to minimize irritation through dermatological testing and gentle ingredient selection. However, individual reactions can vary based on skin type and specific sensitivities. 

If you experience persistent redness, itching, or discomfort after using a Bod cologne, discontinue use and consult a dermatologist.

### How long does a Bod cologne typically last?

Most Bod colognes provide lasting fragrance throughout the day, with peak intensity lasting 2-4 hours. Weather conditions and personal factors like body temperature can affect how long the scent lasts. 

Applying cologne to pulse points helps extend wear time, while avoiding excessive application prevents quick saturation and degradation of the scent profile. 


### Are Bod colognes suitable for daily wear?

Yes, Bod colognes are designed for everyday wear and are suitable for various occasions, from casual outings to professional settings. Their dermatological safety and gentle formulations make them appropriate for regular, daily use. 

Like any fragrance, personal tolerance may vary. If you're planning to wear a cologne in close quarters with others or in environments where strong scents could be overwhelming, consider testing the product first.
