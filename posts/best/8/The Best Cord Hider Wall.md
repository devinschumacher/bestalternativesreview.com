## Buyer's Guide

A cord hider wall is an essential home organization solution that keeps cables and cords neat and out of sight. These walls mount flush against your existing wall, featuring channels or slots to route power strips, headphones, and other devices. Understanding their features and proper installation will help you select the right cord hider for your space. 


### Wall Mounting Options

Choose between surface-mount kits that screw into your wall and flush-mount systems that attach directly to drywall. Surface-mount kits offer more stability but create a slight protrusion. Flush-mount solutions minimize depth but require careful drilling to maintain levelness.

### Cable Management Systems

A good cord hider should accommodate various cable sizes and types. Look for walls with adjustable channels or modular designs that allow customization. The materials should resist wear from frequent cable movement and potential scuffs. 


### Installation Requirements

Measure your space carefully before purchasing. Flush-mount walls typically need a hole no larger than 2 inches in diameter. Consider the wall's composition when selecting drill bit sizes. If your wall contains pipes or wires, consult an electrical contractor to ensure safe installation.

### Mounting Hardware and Accessories

In addition to the base wall, purchase matching cover plates for clean edges. Some systems include cable clips or ties for organizing wires before they reach the wall. Check if the kit includes mounting depth gauges to prevent over-insertion into your wall. 


## FAQ

![Cord-Hider-Wall-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cord-Hider-Wall-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a Cord Hider Wall?

A cord hider wall is a specialized wall-mounted unit designed to store and conceal electrical cables, phone chargers, and other electronic cords. These walls feature compact storage compartments with cable channels that tuck away cords when not in use. 

The primary function of a cord hider wall is to maintain a clean and organized living space by preventing tangled, exposed cords from becoming visual clutter. These units are particularly useful in environments where cables run between multiple electronic devices. 


### What types of cables can be stored in a cord hider wall?

Standard cord hider walls accommodate a variety of cables, including power cords, USB cables, telephone lines, and Ethernet cables. Most models feature flexible channels that can adapt to different cable sizes and shapes. 

Some advanced cord hider walls include specific compartments for distinct cable types, such as power outlets or data transfer cables. These specialized designs help prevent tangling and make it easier to find the right cable when needed. 

![Cord-Hider-Wall-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cord-Hider-Wall-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do I choose the right cord hider wall for my space?

Selecting the appropriate cord hider wall depends on your specific storage needs and available wall space. Measure the length of all cables you plan to store to determine the required unit length. 

Consider the wall's mounting depth and the type of mounting hardware needed. Also, check if the unit requires additional power sources, such as backup battery systems for uninterrupted power supply in case of main power failure. 


### Can cord hider walls be installed in any room?

Cord hider walls can typically be installed in any room where cable management is needed, including home offices, living rooms, and bedrooms. They work best in spaces with electrical fixtures that can supply power for the unit's operation, such as outlets or built-in power systems. 

These walls are particularly effective in multi-device environments like home offices where multiple cables converge, or in bathrooms where space is limited and cable management is crucial for safety and organization. 

![Cord-Hider-Wall-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cord-Hider-Wall-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What maintenance is required for cord hider walls?

Routine maintenance for cord hider walls involves weekly checks for proper cable storage and monthly inspections for signs of wear on the interior channels. Regularly remove dust and debris from the unit's surface and internal compartments. 

If the wall includes power features, ensure that the backup battery system (if applicable) is functioning correctly and consider replacing the battery every two years. For units with LED display features, follow the manufacturer's instructions for screen maintenance. 


### Are cord hider walls compatible with all types of walls?

Cord hider walls require specific wall preparation. The wall surface must be flat, clean, and structurally sound to support the mounting hardware. Most units are designed for drywall or plaster walls and may require additional wall anchors for heavier models. 

Some advanced units offer alternative mounting options, such as screw attachments for concrete walls or magnetic strips for metal surfaces. Consult the manufacturer's guidelines to determine wall compatibility before installation.
