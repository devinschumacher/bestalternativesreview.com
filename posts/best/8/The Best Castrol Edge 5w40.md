Never dispose of motor oil down kitchen sinks, toilets, or storm drains, as it can contaminate groundwater and harm the environment. Locate a certified motor oil recycling center in your area, or participate in local collection events sponsored by oil companies and automotive retailers. 

If you're changing your oil at home, use a funnel and container with a spout to transfer used oil into a sealed container. Avoid mixing oil with water or other fluids.

Performance driving, frequent short trips, extreme temperatures, or towing heavily loaded trailers may require more frequent changes every 3,000 to 5,000 miles. Always check your owner's manual and consult with a mechanic to determine the best maintenance schedule for your vehicle.
