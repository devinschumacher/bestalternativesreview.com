## FAQ


### What makes Versace swim trunks different from other brands?

Versace swim trunks stand out through their high-quality materials, premium construction, and iconic prints. Unlike many other brands, Versace combines durability with style, using premium fabrics that retain their shape and color. 

These trunks feature sophisticated details like four-way stretch, quick-drying technology, and moisture-wicking properties, which are typically reserved for more expensive swimwear lines. 


### Are Versace swim trunks suitable for all body types?

While Versace offers a variety of styles and fits, their standard sizing may not accommodate all body types. The brand tends to run true to size for most, but plus sizes are limited, with options available up to size 44. 

The brand recommends measuring your waist and hips before purchasing to ensure the best fit. For body types that don't fit standard sizing, it's best to contact Versace directly for sizing advice.

Versace offers men's swim trunks in sizes 36 to 52, which is equivalent to European sizing. For women's trunks, sizes range from 32 to 44. The brand also provides plus-size options up to size 44 for women.
