## Buyer's Guide

A power generator from Patriot Power can provide reliable backup electricity during outages, but choosing the right unit requires considering several key factors to ensure it meets your specific needs and budget. 


### Generator Size and Output

The primary specification is the generator's output capacity, measured in watts or kilowatts. Calculate your total electrical load by adding up the wattage requirements of all connected appliances and devices. The generator should have at least 125% of your total load capacity to account for starting currents. 

![Patriot-Power-Generator-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Patriot-Power-Generator-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Transfer Switch Compatibility

For whole-house backup, the generator must be compatible with your existing transfer switch. This safety device prevents backfeeding electrical current into the utility grid while ensuring circuit breakers trip automatically during outages. 


### Fuel Efficiency and Storage

Consider the generator's fuel type (gasoline, propane, or diesel) and its fuel efficiency. Calculate the required fuel tank size based on expected outage duration and generator runtime. Propane and diesel models typically offer better fuel efficiency and longer operating times. 

![Patriot-Power-Generator-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Patriot-Power-Generator-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Maintenance Requirements and Warranty

Compare maintenance schedules and component warranties from different Patriot Power models. Reliable generators should have serviceable air filters, spark plugs, and cooling systems. The manufacturer's warranty terms can also affect long-term reliability and total cost of ownership. 


## FAQ

![Patriot-Power-Generator-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Patriot-Power-Generator-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)

![Patriot-Power-Generator-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Patriot-Power-Generator-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How long can a Patriot Power Generator run on a full fuel tank?

Depending on the model, a full tank of fuel can power a Patriot Generator for 9-14 hours on a single charge. For example, the 12,000-watt model typically runs for 12 hours on gasoline, while the larger 18,000-watt model can run for 14 hours on diesel. 

Users can extend runtime by refueling during extended power outages, making these generators ideal for both short-term emergencies and longer events like camping trips or construction sites. 


### What kind of maintenance do Patriot Power Generators require?

To keep a Patriot Power Generator running efficiently, users should perform weekly maintenance checks, including checking fuel levels, oil status, and air filter condition. The generator's diagnostic system automatically monitors critical components and alerts users to potential issues. 

Major maintenance tasks like changing oil and air filters should be performed every 100 hours of use, or as recommended by the manufacturer. The generator's electronic control system helps users stay on top of maintenance requirements through built-in reminders. 

![Patriot-Power-Generator-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Patriot-Power-Generator-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do Patriot Power Generators start compared to traditional generators?

Starting a Patriot Power Generator is significantly easier than traditional generators. It features a push-button start system that eliminates the need for pull-start mechanisms or complicated recoil starters. The electronic ignition system also allows for smoother and more consistent starting across all models. 

Some models include additional features like keyless entry and remote start capabilities, which further simplify the starting process and improve convenience.
