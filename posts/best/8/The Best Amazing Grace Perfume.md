## Buyer's Guide

Choosing the right Amazing Grace perfume involves considering personal scent preferences, strength of fragrance, longevity, and sillage (the scent's reach). Here's what you need to know to select your ideal bottle. 


### Top Notes

Top notes are the initial scents that greet you when you spray the perfume. Common top notes in Amazing Grace include citrus elements like bergamot and pink grapefruit, which create an energetic start to the fragrance. 


### Heart Notes

The heart notes form the core of the perfume's character, typically becoming more evident about 15-20 minutes after application. Look for floral heart notes in this category, as they often define the perfume's distinctive scent profile. 


### Base Notes

Base notes develop several hours after application and give the fragrance its final character. In Amazing Grace, you might find woody or vanilla undertones that add depth and longevity to the scent. 


### Performance Factors

Consider the perfume's longevity and sillage (how far its scent travels). Higher concentrations of fragrance oils generally provide better longevity. Also, note whether the perfume suits your skin type, as some people may find it too strong or overpowering.
