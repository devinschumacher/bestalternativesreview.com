## Buyer's Guide

Automatic pool skimmers play a crucial role in maintaining your swimming pool's cleanliness and clarity by removing floating debris before it can sink to the bottom. These versatile machines work through a combination of filtration and mechanical means to keep your water pristine with minimal effort required by the pool owner. 


### Key Components of Automatic Pool Skimmers

The primary components of an automatic pool skimmer include a motor, filtration bag, skimming net, and a power source. The motor drives the pump that creates suction, while the filtration bag captures larger debris. The skimming net floats on the water surface, drawing in floating leaves and other particles. Power sources typically include 120V electrical connections or solar panels for eco-friendly options. 

![Automatic-Pool-Skimmer-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Automatic-Pool-Skimmer-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Size and Installation Considerations

When selecting an automatic pool skimmer, consider your pool's size and shape. Rectangular pools may accommodate standard skimmers, while irregularly shaped pools might require specialized models. Installation height and location are also crucial; the skimmer's bottom edge should sit 2-3 inches below the water's surface to prevent backwash and ensure proper suction. Proper installation requires access for maintenance and cleaning. 


### Maintenance Requirements

Regular maintenance is essential for optimal performance. Check and clean the skimming net daily during heavy use seasons to prevent clogging. Replace the filtration bag every 3-6 months based on usage frequency and pool conditions. Monthly inspection of the motor and pump for proper operation and cleaning of surrounding areas helps maintain overall system efficiency. 

![Automatic-Pool-Skimmer-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Automatic-Pool-Skimmer-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Energy Efficiency and Operating Costs

Energy consumption varies between models, with some older designs requiring more power than modern, energy-efficient alternatives. Check the motor's horsepower rating and look for units with adjustable speed controls to optimize energy use. Solar-powered skimmers offer significant cost savings over time but may have higher initial investment. Consider local electricity rates and pool usage patterns when evaluating long-term operating costs. 


## FAQ

![Automatic-Pool-Skimmer-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Automatic-Pool-Skimmer-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How does an automatic pool skimmer work?

Automatic pool skimmers use motorized arms to remove debris from the water surface. The float mechanism guides the arm across the pool, while brushes or nets capture leaves and other floating debris. 

The collected debris is then transported through a hose to the main skimmer basket for disposal, keeping the pool surface clear and reducing the workload for manual cleaning. 


### What size pool skimmer should I get?

Choose a skimmer with a basket volume of 20-30% of your pool's surface area. For example, a pool with a surface area of 150 square feet should have a skimmer basket between 30-45 gallons. 

Always opt for a skimmer that's at least 2 inches wider than your pool's skimmer opening to ensure proper installation and performance. 

![Automatic-Pool-Skimmer-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Automatic-Pool-Skimmer-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How often should I empty the skimmer basket?

Check the basket daily during peak pool use. If your pool sees moderate use, empty it every 2-3 days. In heavy use situations, empty it once daily to prevent overfilling and ensure continuous skimming. 

Regular maintenance prevents clogs and ensures the skimmer operates efficiently. Debris in the water can also damage the motor and impede the skimming process. 


### What maintenance is required for an automatic skimmer?

Check and clean the filter monthly, replacing it when it becomes heavily saturated with debris. This prevents pressure buildup and maintains optimal water flow. 

Inspect the skimmer arm, brushes, and float mechanism weekly. Remove any debris from these components and replace worn parts to maintain proper function. 

![Automatic-Pool-Skimmer-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Automatic-Pool-Skimmer-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How long does an automatic pool skimmer last?

With regular maintenance, an automatic skimmer can last 5-7 years. The motor and float mechanism typically last 3-5 years, while the skimmer basket usually lasts the full term of the unit. 

Signs that indicate replacement may be needed include frequent motor failures, reduced skimming effectiveness, or increased energy consumption. 


### What are the benefits of automatic skimming?

Automatic skimmers significantly reduce pool maintenance time by removing surface debris before it sinks to the bottom. This prevents deeper water cleaning and extends the lifetime of other pool equipment. 

Regular surface cleaning improves water clarity and reduces the workload for manual maintenance tasks like brushing and vacuuming the pool walls and floor.
