Evening fragrances usually contain richer, more complex notes suitable for dinner dates, special events, or formal occasions. 


### Base Notes

Base notes form the foundation of a cologne and determine its longevity. Banana Republic fragrances feature diverse base notes ranging from woody and spicy to warm and vanilla-based. Consider your personal preference and lifestyle - active individuals might prefer stronger base notes that hold up well throughout the day.
