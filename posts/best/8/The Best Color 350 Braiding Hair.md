High-quality braiding hair should have a consistent thickness and minimal shedding to maintain its shape during the braiding process. 


### Length Options

A variety of length options allows you to create different braiding styles. Common lengths range from short snips to full-length strands. Consider whether you need specific lengths for particular braiding techniques or if a multi-length pack offers more versatility for your braiding projects.

### What is Color 350 braiding hair?

Color 350 braiding hair is a type of synthetic hair that's formulated to be tinted and dyed with permanent hair color. The '350' refers to the percentage of keratin content, indicating that it's made with 35% real hair fiber, which gives it more body and texture than standard braiding hair. 

These braids are designed for both short-term use as a wig solution and longer-term use as a permanent hair replacement system. They're typically machine-knotted and come in various textures and lengths to mimic natural hair. 


### How do you color Color 350 braiding hair?

Color 350 braiding hair can be colored using professional hair dye formulas. The process involves pre-lightening the hair with bleach (if needed) and then applying permanent hair dye. The hair should be washed and prepped before dyeing to remove any oils and ensure proper color retention. 

The coloring process requires careful consideration of the hair's texture and density. Thicker braids may need more product and longer processing time compared to thinner ones. Always test a small section first to ensure color compatibility. 

![Color-350-Braiding-Hair-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Color-350-Braiding-Hair-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How long does Color 350 braiding hair last?

The longevity of Color 350 braiding hair depends on several factors, including how it's cared for, how frequently it's worn, and the individual's lifestyle. Proper care can extend its lifespan from 6-12 months, while minimal wear might allow it to last 12-18 months. 

Regular maintenance, including weekly washing, proper storage, and professional maintenance every 3-4 months, can help maximize its longevity. The hair's quality and how well it's maintained throughout its use significantly affect its overall durability. 


### How do you maintain Color 350 braiding hair?

Color 350 braiding hair requires regular maintenance to keep it looking healthy and styled properly. This includes weekly washes with a mild shampoo and conditioner specifically designed for braided hair, followed by thorough drying. 

It's important to avoid excessive heat styling, such as straighteners or curling irons, which can damage the hair's texture and fade the color. The hair should be dressed properly when not worn to prevent tangling and maintain its shape. 

![Color-350-Braiding-Hair-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Color-350-Braiding-Hair-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can you dye Color 350 braiding hair multiple times?

Yes, Color 350 braiding hair can be dyed multiple times, but each subsequent dye job should be treated with care to prevent damage to the hair. The hair's structure and color retention ability reduce with each dyeing, so it's best to limit dye applications to 2-3 before considering replacement. 

Between dye jobs, the hair should be thoroughly cleaned and conditioned to remove any product buildup. If possible, allow at least 6 months between dye applications to give the hair time to recover and maintain its integrity. 


### How do you remove Color 350 braiding hair?

To remove Color 350 braiding hair, use a pair of sharp scissors to carefully cut the machine-knotted ends. The hair should be removed in sections to prevent tugging on the scalp and damage to the hairline. 

After removal, the scalp area should be cleaned thoroughly with a gentle soap and moisturized to prevent irritation. Consider consulting a professional stylist to ensure proper removal and scalp care after the hair is taken out.
