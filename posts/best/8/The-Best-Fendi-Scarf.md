## FAQ

![Fendi-Scarf-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Fendi-Scarf-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What materials are Fendi scarves made from?

Fendi scarves combine luxury and durability through their use of premium materials. The majority are crafted from 100% silk, known for its softness and lustrous sheen. Some designs incorporate cashmere or wool blends, particularly in their ultra-soft, oversized models. 

The silk used in Fendi scarves is of the highest quality, often sourced from Europe's finest silk producers. This ensures each scarf maintains its shape and color while providing exceptional wearability. 


### How should I care for a Fendi scarf?

To keep your Fendi scarf looking its best, follow these care instructions: hand wash in cold water with mild soap, reshape while damp, and air dry flat away from direct heat sources. For detailed guidance, refer to the care label on the scarf packaging. 

Avoid machine washing and using dryers or steaming, as these can damage the delicate fabric. When storing, hang on a padded hanger or roll in a clean cotton bag to prevent snags and maintain the scarf's shape.

Fendi scarves typically retail between $120 to $350, depending on the design complexity, silk quality, and production method. Limited edition or collaboration pieces may cost significantly more. 

Prices can vary based on where you purchase the scarf. Official Fendi stores and authorized retailers may offer slight variations in pricing compared to online marketplaces. 


### How long do Fendi scarves last?

The longevity depends on factors like frequency of wear, care practices, and environmental conditions. Scarves stored properly in a cool, dry place will age best.
