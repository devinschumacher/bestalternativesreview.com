### Size and Fit

Alexia Admor dresses come in multiple sizes to accommodate various body types. The sizing chart on their official website provides specific measurements for each size, allowing you to find your perfect fit. Most dresses offer a true-to-size run, but we recommend measuring yourself against the provided chart before ordering. 

If you fall between sizes or prefer a different fit, the brand allows exchanges within 30 days of purchase. Their customer service team can assist with sizing questions and recommendations before you make your selection. 


### Maintenance and Care

Alexia Admor suggests basic care guidelines for their dresses, including regular hand washing in cold water with mild detergent. Special garments may require dry cleaning, so check the care label for specific instructions. To maintain the dress's shape, hang it carefully and avoid exposure to direct sunlight, which can cause fading. 

For storage, fold the dress rather than hanging it to prevent stretching. Use acid-free tissue paper between the dress and hangers if hanging is necessary to protect the material from scratches and damage.

International shipping is also available but may incur customs duties and taxes based on your location.

### Return Policy

Alexia Admor allows returns or exchanges within 30 days of delivery for any reason. You must contact their customer service team to initiate the return process and obtain a return authorization number. The dress should be in its original condition with all tags attached and packaged in the original shipping box. 

Refunds will be issued to the original payment method after the dress is received and inspected. In most cases, the refund process is completed within 7-10 business days of receiving your returned item. The customer is responsible for return shipping costs unless the dress arrives damaged. 


### Cleanse-and-Store Requirements

Before storing your Alexia Admor dress, give it a thorough hand wash using mild detergent and cold water. For special fabrics, check the care label for specific instructions. After washing, allow the dress to air dry completely before folding it and placing it in an acid-free storage bag or padded hanger. 

Regularly air out stored dresses monthly to prevent musty odors. If you notice any signs of damage during storage, address them immediately to prevent further deterioration. With proper care, these dresses can last for years, providing multiple seasons of wear.
