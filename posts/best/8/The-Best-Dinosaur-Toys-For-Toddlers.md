## FAQ


### What age range are dinosaur toys suitable for?

Dinosaur toys are generally appropriate for toddlers aged 1-3 years old. These toys are designed to be safe for small children, with smooth surfaces and no small parts that could pose a choking hazard. 

For older toddlers (3-5 years), look for more complex toys that encourage imaginative play and learning about dinosaurs. These might include puzzles, figures with articulating features, or toys that teach about different species. 


### What types of materials are these toys made from?

The most common materials for toddler dinosaur toys are plastic and rubber. These materials are durable, easy to clean, and safer for young children. 

Some premium toys use wooden materials, which can be more expensive but offer natural durability and a tactile sensory experience. Always check the manufacturer's guidelines for appropriate materials and cleaning instructions. 


### How can I choose the right size toy?

Select toys that are slightly larger than your toddler's mouth to prevent choking hazards. A general rule is that the toy should be bigger than your toddler's fist. 

Consider the play space when choosing the size. Smaller toys work well for travel or playrooms with limited space, while larger figures are great for floor play and imaginative scenarios. 


### What features make a toy educational?

Look for toys that include detailed drawings or realistic sculpting, which can help build observational skills and knowledge about dinosaurs. 

Interactive features like sound effects, flashing lights, or detachable parts can make learning more engaging. Educational toys should aim to teach basic facts about dinosaurs, their habitats, or behavior. 


### How should I care for these toys?

Toy dinosaurs made of plastic or rubber typically require simple care, such as regular washing with mild soap and water. Check manufacturer's guidelines for specific instructions. 

For wooden toys, wipe with a damp cloth and ensure they dry completely to prevent warping or cracking. Store toys in a dry place when not in use to prevent damage. 


### What's the best way to introduce dinosaur toys to my toddler?

Start by showing your toddler the toy and discussing what it is, using simple language. Point out key features like the shape, color, or movement. 

Encourage play through simple actions, like having a "dinosaur snack" or taking the toy for a "walk" around the room. This helps develop fine motor skills and imaginative play.
