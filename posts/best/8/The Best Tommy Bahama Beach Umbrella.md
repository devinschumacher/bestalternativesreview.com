## Buyer's Guide

Tommy Bahama beach umbrellas combine stylish design with practical functionality for outdoor entertaining. When selecting a Tommy Bahama umbrella, consider these key factors to find one that matches your needs and preferences. 


### Size and Span

Measure the available space where you plan to place the umbrella. The span should be at least 1.5 times the diameter of your dining table to provide ample shade. Consider the weight capacity of your table if you plan to use it with umbrellas featuring heavy canopies or built-in accessories. 

![Tommy-Bahama-Beach-Umbrella-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Tommy-Bahama-Beach-Umbrella-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Material and Construction

Choose between polyester and canvas materials, with polyester offering better UV resistance and faster drying time. Premium models feature reinforced hinges, anti-wobble bases, and powder-coated metal frames for enhanced stability in windy conditions. 


### Wind Resistance and Stability

Look for umbrellas with weighted bases that can hold at least 25 pounds of sand or water. Some models include hidden weights or sand pockets for added stability. Consider the umbrella's height-to-span ratio - shorter, wider umbrellas generally perform better in wind than tall, narrow ones. 

![Tommy-Bahama-Beach-Umbrella-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Tommy-Bahama-Beach-Umbrella-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Portability and Portability Features

If mobility is important, choose an umbrella with a carrying bag and telescoping shaft. Umbrellas featuring quick-release mechanisms for the canopy and base simplify setup and storage. Consider the weight of the umbrella when evaluating how practical it will be for your needs. 


## FAQ

### What makes Tommy Bahama beach umbrellas unique?

Tommy Bahama beach umbrellas combine elegant design with practical features. They're known for their sturdy aluminum frames and weather-resistant fabric, with designs inspired by tropical landscapes and nautical themes. 

Each umbrella comes with a heavy base to prevent tipping, and some models include features like built-in coolers or adjustable guy lines for extra stability in windy conditions. 


### How do I properly measure for a beach umbrella?

To find the right size, measure the distance between your lounge chairs or the diameter of the desired shaded area. Add 10% extra for coverage and 2 feet for the base. 

Remember to measure from the ground to the highest points when setting up your umbrella, as most brands require a minimum height clearance of 8 feet for their canopies. 

![Tommy-Bahama-Beach-Umbrella-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Tommy-Bahama-Beach-Umbrella-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What's the difference between retractable and fixed beach umbrellas?

Retractable umbrellas store the canopy inside the frame when not in use, taking up less space. They're ideal for smaller areas or locations with limited storage. 

Fixed umbrellas extend outward and are typically larger in size. They offer more shade but need more storage space. Both types require regular maintenance to operate smoothly. 


### How do I clean a Tommy Bahama beach umbrella?

For light cleaning, use a soft brush and mild soap solution. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive materials that might damage the finish. 

For deep cleaning or if the umbrella is heavily soiled, disassemble the frame and wipe each component individually. Allow all parts to dry completely before reassembly. 

![Tommy-Bahama-Beach-Umbrella-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Tommy-Bahama-Beach-Umbrella-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How much weight can a Tommy Bahama beach umbrella support?

The maximum weight capacity varies by model, typically ranging from 20 to 50 pounds. This includes the weight of the umbrella itself, furniture, and any decorative items placed under it. 

Always refer to the specific product's weight rating, as models with larger canopies or additional features may have reduced weight capacity. 


### What's the best way to store a beach umbrella?

When not in use, store the umbrella with the canopy fully closed and the frame fully extended. Place it in a covered area to protect from dust and direct sunlight. 

Some models include carrying bags or storage boxes, which help protect the umbrella during transport and minimize storage space when not in use.
