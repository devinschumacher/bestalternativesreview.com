### Sole Designs and Geometry

Cleveland putters feature different sole designs that affect how the club interacts with the ground.

### Face Materials and Construction

The putter face material and construction method impact how the club responds to impact. Options include stainless steel with various milling patterns, Carpenter 28 stainless steel with proprietary forging, and even some models featuring face-milled tungsten weights. The face composition affects both feel and potential for increased ball speed through a properly square face at impact. 


### Grip Options and Customization

Cleveland offers a range of grip options to suit different hand sizes and preferences. Standard grip sizes, larger D-grips, and even belly putter options are available. The grip shape and texture can significantly influence feel and control. Some models also offer interchangeable grip treads or dual-grip designs for additional customization.

### Fitting Considerations

Proper fit is crucial for Cleveland putters, especially when considering the club's length, lie angle, and overall balance. The putter should hang naturally at address with the center of the grip just inside the heels of your hands. The clubface should automatically square at impact with a neutral grip. Consideration of your stance width and preferred aiming technique is also important.
