## Buyer's Guide

The Coach Poppy collection combines casual comfort with classic styling. When selecting your Poppy shoes, consider several key factors to find the right pair for your needs. 


### Shoe Construction and Materials

Coach Poppy shoes feature durable canvas and leather construction. Premium models use full-grain leather while more casual styles may have synthetic canvas. Consider the material quality based on how you plan to wear the shoes. 

![Coach-Poppy-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Coach-Poppy-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Footbed and Interior Comfort

The footbed should be padded for comfort, with some models offering additional orthopedic support. Check the interior lining material - leather-lined shoes provide better breathability than synthetic options. 


### Height and Design

Poppy styles range from low-top training shoes to mid-cut models with ankle support. The height affects both comfort and how the shoe sits on your foot. Consider whether you prefer a snug fit or more roomy toe box. 

![Coach-Poppy-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Coach-Poppy-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Color and Pattern Options

Pick a color or pattern that complements your style and wardrobe. The classic white canvas with black trim is versatile, while more vibrant colors stand out. Patterns like Checks and Plaid add visual interest.
