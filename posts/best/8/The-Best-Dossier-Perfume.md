Dossier's interpretation of Woody Raspberry opens with luscious raspberry notes that gradually give way to an orange blossom heart, with hints of patchouli and honey rounding out the base. The fragrance unfolds slowly, allowing each layer to emerge gradually on the skin. While some might detect underlying similarities to traditional jasmine perfumes, the overall effect is unexpectedly fresh and slightly woody, with subtle fruit and flower nuances that make it both approachable and distinctive.

This luxuriously rich fragrance captures the essence of tuberose, the spirited Mexican flower that conquered the world with its heady scent. Notes of orange blossom, benzoin, and musk surround the heart of creamy tuberose, creating a captivatingly sensual composition that reveals deeper floral complexities as it develops. The result is a deeply elegant scent that balances natural elements with an air of sophistication, perfect for both tuberose enthusiasts and those seeking a rich, floral signature fragrance.

This discovery set lets you try 10 different Dossier perfumes, each one in a nice-sized 11 mL bottle that's perfect for travel. The scents range from sweet vanilla to fresh lavender, with options for every taste preference. While some people might only like a few of the scents, others have fallen in love with their discoveries, especially the woody sandalwood and the marshmallow fragrance that's better than Kilian's Love, Don't Be Shy. The high-quality atomizers let the delicate notes really shine, though a couple of bottles did have minor spray issues that needed addressing.

The powdery tobacco scent from Dossier offers a striking twist on the classic Tom Ford vanilla tobacco, with notes of ginger that add a spicy kick to the mix. The fragrance evolves beautifully on the skin, revealing layers of vanilla, tonka bean, and gourmand dry fruit aromas that create an opulent, sophisticated profile. While some find it slightly powdery compared to the original, most agree that it delivers exceptional longevity and an irresistibly warm, comforting base.

This impression captures the heart of Black Orchid with a rich tapestry of cinnamon, pink pepper, and ylang-ylang leading into an opulent resting place of patchouli, creamy sandalwood, plum, and vanilla. While some detect a hint of masculinity, the fragrance reveals its depth through a natural evolution that transforms the initial powdery impression into a complex, sophisticated blend of spice and florals. The result is a scent that lingers powerfully for hours, perfectly capturing the essence of exotic summer nights at a fraction of the designer's retail price.

Fruity Almond captures the essence of Carolina Herrera's Good Girl with its uplifting peach and almond notes that give way to a luxurious floral heart of tuberose and orange blossom.

A refreshed take on a classic citrusy scent, this guys' cologne opens with a sharp burst of minty-fresh ginger followed by zesty lemon notes.

## Buyer's Guide

Dossier Perfume combines the artistry of fragrance creation with practical personalization options, allowing users to create custom colognes. This guide examines the key aspects of Dossier Perfume, helping you make an informed choice based on your scent preferences and lifestyle needs. 


### Personalization Options

Customization is at the core of Dossier Perfume. You can select from thousands of fragrance ingredients to create unique scents. The system offers detailed control over notes and concentrations, allowing for precise personalization. Consider how much time you want to spend on the customization process when deciding between the different creation levels offered. 


### Scarf Technology

The perfume is stored in a special scarf that keeps the fragrance stable and pure. This technology requires careful consideration of how you'll transport and store your creation. The scarf should be protected from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures to maintain the perfume's quality. 


### Size and Travel

Standard Dossier Perfume produces approximately 100 ml of fragrance. This amount is sufficient for several months of regular use but may not be ideal for travel or frequent changes. Consider your usage patterns to determine if you need a larger or smaller initial creation. 


### Long-term Storage

The perfume's stability in the special scarf means it can be stored for extended periods without degradation. However, the scent's intensity may diminish over time. If you're creating seasonal perfumes, plan accordingly to ensure you have fresh scents available when needed.

Our collection includes both unisex and gender-specific fragrances that range from fresh and invigorating to warm and comforting notes. The perfumes are available in multiple sizes, from travel-friendly options to larger containers for daily use. 


### What makes Dossier Perfume different from other fragrance brands?

At Dossier, we focus on creating scents that offer long-lasting wear and exceptional quality without compromising on affordability. Unlike some premium brands that prioritize exclusivity, our perfumes provide remarkable value while maintaining high standards of craftsmanship. 

We also invest in diverse fragrance options, including several gender-neutral scents that appeal to a broader audience. Our commitment to modern, versatile fragrances sets us apart from brands that rely heavily on traditional masculine or feminine scent profiles. 


### How long does Dossier Perfume last on the skin?

Our fragrances are formulated to provide lasting wear of 6-8 hours with proper application techniques. Fresh applications typically last 2-4 hours, while a second application after about 4 hours can extend the scent's longevity. 

The longevity can vary based on individual skin type, the application method (spray vs. dab), and environmental factors such as temperature and humidity. For the best results, we recommend applying perfume to pulse points like wrists, neck, and behind the ears. 


### What sizes are available for Dossier Perfume?

Our collection offers several size options to suit different needs and preferences. Travel sprays range from 1 oz to 1.7 oz, while regular bottles come in 3.4 oz, 1 oz, and 0.5 oz sizes. 

We also offer medium-sized bottles of 6 oz and 12 oz for daily use or collecting. These sizes provide a balance between practicality and value, making them ideal for both personal use and gifting. 


### How should I store Dossier Perfume?

To maintain the freshness and longevity of your Dossier Perfume, store it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and extreme temperature changes. Ideal storage conditions are between 60-75°F (15-24°C). 

Avoid keeping your perfume in the bathroom, as the fluctuating temperatures and humidity can affect its quality. Keep the spray bottle upright when not in use to prevent air from entering and degrading the fragrance. 


### Can I return or exchange Dossier Perfume?
