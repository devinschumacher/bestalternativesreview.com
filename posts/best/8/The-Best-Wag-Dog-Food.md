## Buyer's Guide

Nutritious and palatable dog food is crucial for your wag's health and happiness. Understanding key aspects of dog nutrition helps you choose the right food for your pet's lifestyle and health needs. 


### Protein Quality and Source

High-quality proteins form the foundation of a healthy diet. Look for meats like chicken, beef, or fish as the primary protein source, listed first in the ingredients. Avoid foods containing fillers like meal or by-products. 

![Wag-Dog-Food-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Wag-Dog-Food-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Fresh vs. Freeze-Dried vs. Canned

Pick a format that matches your lifestyle and your wag's dietary preferences. Fresh foods offer optimal nutrition, freeze-dried options preserve more nutrients than cans, and canned foods provide excellent moisture content for dogs who don't drink enough water. 


### Carbohydrate Sources

Healthy carbohydrates provide energy and support gut health. Complex carbohydrates like sweet potatoes, green peas, and brown rice are preferable to simple carbohydrates or grain mixes.

### Additive Considerations

Avoid artificial preservatives, colors, and flavors. Opt for foods with natural preservatives like tocopherols instead. Check for essential vitamins and minerals but avoid supplements unless recommended by a veterinarian.
