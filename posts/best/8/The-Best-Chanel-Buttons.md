## Buyer's Guide

Coco Chanel revolutionized fashion with her simple yet timeless designs, and her signature buttons remain a symbol of elegance and quality. When selecting Chanel buttons, consider their authenticity, material, and intended use to ensure you're adding a piece of luxury history to your collection. 


### Authenticity Verification

Chanel buttons typically feature the signature interlocking CC logo, often gold-plated or made from mother-of-pearl. Authentic buttons usually have these details cast in a single piece, while counterfeit versions might be assembled from separate parts. The surface finish and engraving quality can also indicate authenticity. 


### Material Quality

The most valuable Chanel buttons are made from quality materials like mother-of-pearl, gold, or silver. Mother-of-pearl buttons often exhibit natural variations in color and pattern. Gold-plated buttons should have a substantial thickness, while solid gold pieces are rarer and more valuable. 


### Button Style and Size

Chanel buttons come in various styles, including plain discs, sculpted designs, and those with raised elements. Common sizes range from 10mm to 30mm, with smaller buttons often more challenging to find. Consider the specific style and size that matches your collection's aesthetic and your intended use for the buttons. 


### Care and Preservation

Proper care ensures your Chanel buttons maintain their beauty for years. Store them in a dry place away from direct sunlight and chemicals. Clean plain metal and mother-of-pearl buttons with mild soap and water, while gold-plated pieces should be cleaned with a specialized product to prevent scratching. Regular maintenance helps preserve these luxury accessories. 


## FAQ


### What makes Chanel buttons distinctive?

Coco Chanel introduced her signature buttons in the 1950s, combining simple elegance with refined craftsmanship. Each button features a raised monogram on one side, representing 'CC' or '2CC, ' and a flat back with intricate stitching called 'borders. ' The button shape can vary, from round to oval. 

Authentic Chanel buttons are recognized by their high-quality materials and precise details. The raised monogram is particularly distinctive, as it's debossed rather than engraved for lasting clarity. Many collectors and designers can identify a true Chanel button by these subtle characteristics. 


### Where can I find authentic Chanel buttons?

Original Chanel buttons are typically found in Chanel boutiques, authenticated online stores, and authorized retailers. The brand's official website occasionally offers these buttons as part of their accessory collection. 

For vintage buttons, look for reputable antique boutiques, vintage Chanel dealers, and established estate jewelry sellers. Always verify authenticity through certification from recognized sources. 


### How do I care for Chanel buttons?

Clean buttons with a soft cloth using mild soap and warm water, then allow them to air dry completely. For proper storage, place them in a button box or individually in acid-free paper to prevent damage and minimize contact with air and light. 

Avoid exposure to extreme temperatures, direct sunlight, and chemicals that can damage the materials. Regular maintenance helps preserve the button's integrity and appearance over time. 


### What materials are used in Chanel buttons?

Chanel buttons are crafted from high-quality materials including metal, mother-of-pearl, and Bakelite. Metal buttons feature a raised monogram on one side and a flat back with intricate stitching. Mother-of-pearl buttons typically display the 'CC' monogram on both sides, while Bakelite examples showcase a smooth, plastic-like surface with a raised monogram. 

The brand has occasionally used alternative materials like resin and wood for special editions, though metal remains the most common material for their signature buttons. 


### How much are Chanel buttons worth?

Price varies significantly based on condition, material, and rarity. Metal buttons in excellent condition typically range from $20 to $100, while vintage mother-of-pearl examples can fetch between $100 and $500. Authentic vintage buttons can increase in value by 10-20% annually for rare or well-preserved pieces. 

Rare or unusual varieties may command premium prices. For precise valuation, consult with an expert at a reputable auction house or vintage boutique. 


### What should I look for when purchasing Chanel buttons?

When selecting Chanel buttons, examine the raised monogram for clarity and detail. The stitching pattern on the back should be consistent and evenly spaced. Vintage pieces may display some slight wear, but should show no major damage or discoloration. 

Most importantly, verify authenticity through official channels or recognized dealers. Authenticated buttons carry a guarantee of origin, while fakes can be less valuable and require more maintenance.
