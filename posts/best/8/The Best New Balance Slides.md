The rubber sole offers decent grip, but the lack of adjustment on the top strap means they might not accommodate very wide feet. Overall, if you're looking for a pair of reliable, everyday slides that combine support with a touch of athletic style, these are definitely worth considering.

## Buyer's Guide

New Balance slides combine comfort with functionality, making them a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor footwear. Understanding the key features and considerations can help you select the right pair for your needs. 


### Materials and Construction

The upper material determines breathability and durability. Common options include mesh for ventilation and synthetic leather for added support. The sole construction affects grip and cushioning. Look for patterns that maximize traction while allowing flexibility.

### Arch Support and Fit

Proper arch support prevents fatigue during long wear. The footbed should cradle the arch but allow some natural arch movement. Ensure the shoes fit snugly in the heel and toe box, with room to wiggle your toes. 


### Weight and Dampening

Lighter shoes reduce fatigue during extended wear. The sole material and construction significantly impact weight. Consider models specifically designed for dampening high-impact activities or those with thicker soles for extra protection.

### Style and Versatility

While performance is crucial, compatibility with your existing footwear collection is important. Choose a versatile style that pairs well with both casual and athletic wear. Consider the overall design and construction quality for lasting appeal. 


## FAQ

![New-Balance-Slides-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/New-Balance-Slides-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are New Balance slides made of?

New Balance slides typically feature a durable polyethylene base with an anti-slip surface treatment. The base provides stability, while the textured surface helps prevent slipping during use. 

Some models incorporate cushioning in the heel or midsole for added comfort, though most slides prioritize basic construction for durability. 


### How do I clean my New Balance slides?

Clean your slides with a damp cloth and mild soap after each use. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners that could damage the surface. 

If the anti-slip coating shows signs of wear, you can refresh it with a specially formulated coating available at sports equipment stores.

### How long do New Balance slides last?

With regular use, New Balance slides typically provide 6-12 months of service before needing replacement. This varies based on usage frequency and care. 

Check for signs of wear, such as cracks in the base or fading of the anti-slip coating, to determine when it's time to replace your slides. 


### Are New Balance slides suitable for all seasons?

Most New Balance slides are designed for indoor use and are appropriate for year-round training. The polyethylene base maintains grip regardless of temperature changes. 

If you live in an extremely cold climate, consider models with rubber components for added traction on frozen surfaces.

### How do New Balance slides compare to similar products?

New Balance slides generally offer better cushioning and stability compared to generic options, though some competitors may match their basic construction. 

Look for models with extra grip features or cushioning if you want to differentiate between similar products. 


### Can I wear New Balance slides with socks?

While New Balance slides are designed for direct foot contact, you can wear thin moisture-wicking socks if you prefer extra cushioning. 

Avoid thick socks or shoes that might bunch up inside the slide, compromising both comfort and stability.
