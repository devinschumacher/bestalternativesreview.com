## Buyer's Guide

Sunpan furniture combines style and durability through their authentic teak wood and hand-woven rattan collections. When selecting pieces, consider the furniture's craftsmanship, material quality, and whether it matches your desired aesthetic. 


### Craftsmanship and Quality

High-quality Sunpan furniture features detailed craftsmanship with proper jointing and sturdy construction. Look for tight-weave patterns in the rattan and straight, consistent lines in the wood pieces. The furniture should feel solid without excessive weight, indicating proper material thickness.

### Material Durability

Authentic teak wood resists rot and warping, making it ideal for outdoor furniture. The wood should have a natural golden hue with distinct grain patterns.

### Aesthetic Suitability

Before purchasing, measure your space to ensure the furniture's size is appropriate. Sunpan offers several style variations including contemporary, traditional, and coastal designs. Consider how the piece will complement your existing decor, particularly the color palette and overall theme of your room or outdoor area.
