## FAQ


### What is the Mila Air Purifier?

The Mila Air Purifier is an advanced air cleaning system designed to remove dust, pollen, smoke, and other airborne particles from your living space. This compact device uses a multi-stage filtration process to improve indoor air quality. 

Mila offers several models with different filter capacities and airflow rates, allowing you to choose the right size for your room or specific air purification needs. The purifiers operate quietly and can help reduce allergens and pollutants in your home environment. 


### How effective is the Mila Air Purifier?

Independent testing has shown Mila air purifiers to be highly effective in removing common airborne particles. They capture particles as small as 0.3 microns with an efficiency rate of 99.97% or higher, making them effective against dust, pollen, mold spores, and pet dander. 

The filtration system works by drawing air into the unit, passing it through a series of filters that trap particles, and then blowing the clean air back into the room. This continuous cycle helps maintain a clean air environment in the designated space. 


### What does the filter system consist of?

Mila air purifiers use a multi-stage filtration system. The primary filters capture larger particles such as pet hair and dust, while deeper filters trap smaller particles. They may also include activated carbon filters to remove odors and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). 

The specific filter configuration varies by model. Some units feature pre-filters, activated carbon layers, and true HEPA filters. Regular maintenance requires replacing these filters according to the manufacturer's recommendations to maintain optimal performance. 


### What room sizes are appropriate for Mila air purifiers?

Mila air purifiers are designed for specific room sizes to ensure efficient operation and optimal air quality. Basic models are suitable for smaller rooms such as bedrooms or living spaces (up to 160 square feet), while larger models can handle larger rooms or multiple rooms (up to 400 square feet). 

Room size compatibility is based on the purifier's CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate) rating. This rating indicates how much clean air the unit can deliver per minute and how effectively it circulates the room. Ensure the purifier's stated CADR matches or exceeds your room's square footage for optimal performance. 


### How much noise does a Mila air purifier make?

Mila air purifiers are designed to operate quietly without disturbing your daily activities. Most models run at a sound level of 25-45 decibels, which is comparable to a soft conversation or a quiet library environment. 

The noise level varies by model and fan speed setting. Some units offer multiple fan speeds, allowing you to adjust the operating noise based on your needs. The purifiers use efficient motors and minimal fans to keep noise levels low while maintaining effective air circulation. 


### How much does it cost to run a Mila air purifier?

The operating cost of a Mila air purifier depends on the model's power consumption and how many hours it runs daily. Basic models consume around 25 watts while operating, which costs approximately $0.02 per hour at standard electricity rates. 

Filter replacement costs vary by model and frequency of use. A single filter typically costs $30-50, and replacement intervals range from 6 months to 2 years depending on usage. The total annual operating cost, including filter replacement, is usually between $20 and $100, depending on usage frequency.
