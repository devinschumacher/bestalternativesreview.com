## Buyer's Guide

Victoria Secret Angel perfumes are beloved for their distinctive scents and glamorous packaging. When selecting an Angel fragrance, consider factors like top notes, middle notes, and base notes to find a scent that matches your preferences. The collection offers a variety of interpretations, from fruity and floral to musky and woody. 


### Top Notes

The top notes are the first scents you'll detect when applying the perfume. These are typically the lightest and most volatile components. Common top notes in Angel fragrances include fruity, citrusy, and herbal elements. 


### Middle Notes

The middle notes form the heart of the fragrance and typically last longer than top notes. They develop about 15-30 minutes after application. Middle notes often include floral, green, and spicy scents that create the base's signature character. 


### Base Notes

The base notes provide the lasting finish to a fragrance and are usually the heaviest components. They develop around 30 minutes after application and can last several hours. Common base notes in Angel perfumes include vanilla, wood, and musk, which create the scent's lasting impression. 


### Sillage and Durability

Sillage refers to the intensity of the fragrance's scent trail, while longevity denotes how long the fragrance lasts on the skin. Consider your lifestyle and scents you typically pair with your wardrobe when choosing a fragrance with appropriate sillage and longevity.
