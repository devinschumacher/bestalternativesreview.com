## Buyer's Guide

Unicorn pool floats combine playful design with practical relaxation, making them a popular addition to summer pool parties and solo lounging sessions. Understanding key features will help you select a float that combines safety, durability, and aesthetic appeal. 


### Safety Features

Priority one is your personal safety. Look for floats rated for adult weight capacity, typically 220-250 pounds. The design should prevent flipping, with a stable, level floatation surface. Safety-tested material ensures it remains buoyant without leaks, while non-slip bases keep you securely positioned. 

![Unicorn-Pool-Float-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Unicorn-Pool-Float-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Aesthetic Considerations

Unicorn floats range from simple outlines to elaborate designs. Material affects visibility - clear or translucent floats are less distracting to others but might show through swimsuits. The unicorn's appearance influences visual appeal - detailed designs stand out but may be more prone to damage. 


### Size and Shape

Standard sizes fit comfortably across your torso while allowing movement. Larger shapes provide more surface area but reduce maneuverability. The unicorn's position (side-facing vs. belly-down) affects your positioning and the float's stability in water. 

![Unicorn-Pool-Float-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Unicorn-Pool-Float-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Maintenance and Durability

Materials range from inflatable PVC to solid foam, with varying lifespans. Inflated floats need regular pressure checks and storage in dry conditions. Solid foam floats resist punctures but are heavier to transport. The float's build quality affects how well it maintains its shape over time. 


## FAQ

![Unicorn-Pool-Float-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Unicorn-Pool-Float-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the dimensions of the unicorn pool float?

The standard unicorn pool float measures approximately 36 inches long by 18 inches wide. Some variations may have slightly different proportions. 

These dimensions make the float comfortable for short-term use but are not designed for extended sitting. 


### How much does a unicorn pool float typically weigh?

A typical unicorn pool float weighs around 5 pounds. This weight makes it easy to move but may not be suitable for very young children who can't lift heavier floats. 

The lightweight design also means it's less likely to cause imbalances in crowded pools. 

![Unicorn-Pool-Float-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Unicorn-Pool-Float-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What materials are unicorn pool floats made from?

Most unicorn pool floats are made from high-density closed-cell foam. This material keeps the float afloat and provides good durability. 

The foam base is often covered with a waterproof vinyl or polyester fabric featuring a unicorn design. 


### How should I maintain my unicorn pool float?

After each use, rinse the float with fresh water and allow it to air dry completely before storing. This prevents mildew growth and extends the float's lifespan. 

Store the float in a dry place when not in use to protect it from moisture damage. 

![Unicorn-Pool-Float-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Unicorn-Pool-Float-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How long do unicorn pool floats typically last?

With regular use and proper maintenance, a high-quality unicorn pool float can last 2-3 years. Factors affecting longevity include exposure to sunlight, frequency of use, and storage conditions. 

Look for foam core construction and durable cover materials to maximize your float's lifespan. 


### Can I use a unicorn pool float in saltwater pools?

While some unicorn pool floats are suitable for saltwater, it's important to check the product's rating first. Saltwater can accelerate wear and tear on the float cover material. 

If you plan to use the float in saltwater, choose one specifically designed for such environments to ensure longevity.
