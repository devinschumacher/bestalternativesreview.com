## Buyer's Guide

Doorstops are essential for protecting door frames, thresholds, and floors from damage while keeping doors open at convenient angles. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the right doorstop for your needs. 


### Design and Placement Options

Doorstops come in two primary designs: threshold-mounted and block-mounted. Threshold-mounted doorstops attach to the bottom edge of an open door, while block-mounted doorstops sit on the floor near the door's edge. Consider your space and door type to determine which mounting option works best. 

![Doorstops-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Doorstops-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Material Durability

Common materials include rubber, plastic, and metal. Rubber offers excellent impact absorption and durability, making it suitable for high-traffic areas. Plastic doorstops are lightweight and affordable but may crack over time. Metal doorstops, particularly aluminum, provide great value with minimal maintenance requirements. 


### Size and Weight Capacity

The optimal size depends on the door and the desired open angle. General guidelines suggest one doorstop per 24 inches of door height. Weigh your door to determine the appropriate weight capacity â€“ typically ranging from 30 to 50 pounds for standard doors. Heavy-duty options are available for oversized or double-doors. 

![Doorstops-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Doorstops-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Ergonomic and Weather Resistance

Ergonomic doorstops minimize strain on the user and door structure. Look for natural inclining designs that redirect pressure away from door frames. For outdoor use, choose weather-resistant materials like rubber or sealed plastic to prevent damage from moisture and temperature changes. 


## FAQ

![Doorstops-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Doorstops-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a doorstop?

A doorstop is a small, weighted device that prevents doors from closing completely, keeping them slightly open for various purposes. They come in different designs, including rubber disks, metal blocks, and adjustable brackets. 

Common uses for doorstops include holding pet gates open, maintaining proper air circulation in enclosed spaces, and allowing enough space for footwear in narrow closets. 


### What materials are doorstops typically made from?

The most common materials for doorstops are rubber, metal, and weighted blocks. Rubber doorstops are flexible and quiet when placed against doors, while metal and weighted blocks provide more stability in high-traffic areas. 

Some specialized doorstops incorporate plastic or composite materials for added durability in outdoor applications or environments with high foot traffic. 

![Doorstops-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Doorstops-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How much weight does a doorstop need to be effective?

A standard doorstop needs to weigh between 1 to 2 pounds to be effective for most household doors. Heavier doors or doors that require more force to keep open may need doorstops that weigh between 2 to 5 pounds. 

For multi-layer doors or doors with heavy curtains, consider using two doorstops placed at different heights on the door. 


### Can doorstops be damaged by chemicals or weather?

Standard rubber doorstops can be damaged by exposure to harsh chemicals like bleach or gasoline. If you need doorstops for an outdoor application or a chemical-storage area, look for models specifically designed to resist those elements. 

Metal doorstops can corrode in damp environments or when exposed to saltwater. Opt for stainless steel or coated metal doorstops for outdoor or marine applications. 

![Doorstops-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Doorstops-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the safest doorstop designs for homes with pets and children?

Smooth, round doorstops with rubber bases are ideal for homes with pets and children, as they prevent accidents and reduce the risk of injury when doors open suddenly. Avoid doorstops with sharp edges or small parts that could pose a choking hazard. 

Doorstops with built-in wheels or casters provide additional safety by rolling away from the door when pressure is applied, preventing finger injuries and door closings. 


### How should doorstops be installed to prevent damage to walls and floors?

Place doorstops on the side of the door that contacts the floor when open to prevent damage to both the door and the surrounding surfaces. Never install doorstops in high-traffic areas where people might trip over them. 

Use wall anchors or screws specifically designed for doorstops if you need to attach them to drywall or other non-structural surfaces. Always measure the door's thickness and weight capacity before installation to ensure proper support.
