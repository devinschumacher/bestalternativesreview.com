## Buyer's Guide

When selecting a Qanba drone, consider key factors such as camera quality, flight time, control range, and durability. The drone's camera should match your photography and videography needs, with options for both basic and professional features. Flight time affects how long you can shoot without landing, while control range determines how far you can operate the drone from its base. Durability is crucial for protecting your investment, especially when shooting in challenging environments. 


### Camera Features

For basic users, a 1080p camera with 10x optical zoom is sufficient for stable videos and clear photos. Professionals may prefer higher resolutions like 4K or 8K, with options for higher zoom capabilities. Consider whether you need features like ND filters, time-lapse modes, or specialized lenses for different shooting scenarios.

### Flight Performance

Key flight specifications include maximum speed, hover time, and flight range. Most consumer drones offer speeds between 30-60 km/h, with hover times typically ranging from 15-25 minutes. The drone's flight range usually extends between 1-5 kilometers, though some models offer extended ranges. 


### Battery Life and Charging

Look for drones with at least 15-minute flight times for basic shooting needs. For longer videos, prioritize models with 20-25 minute flight times. Consider the charging system: some drones support quick charging, while others require longer periods. USB-C charging is standard, though some older models use Micro-USB ports.

### Weather Resistance and Size

Professional drones often feature IP ratings for weather resistance, with higher numbers indicating better protection against rain, snow, and dust. The drone's size affects its stability and ease of transport. Most consumer drones measure between 30-60 cm, while larger models can reach 100 cm or more in length. 


## FAQ

![Qanba-Drone-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Qanba-Drone-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is the Qanba Drone?

The Qanba Drone is a portable, wireless device designed for aerial photography and videography. It features an extendable arm that supports a 4K camera and stabilizes the video feed for smooth footage. 

Users control the drone via a companion app on their smartphone or tablet, which also provides basic editing tools for the captured media. 


### What makes Qanba Drones different from other aerial photography devices?

Qanba drones stand out with their simple, one-handed operation thanks to the extendable arm that holds the camera. This design eliminates the need for complex controllers, making them accessible to beginners while still offering professional-quality results. 

Unlike multi-rotor drones that require careful flight planning, Qanba's stabilization technology allows for more creative and intuitive shooting angles with minimal technical knowledge. 

![Qanba-Drone-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Qanba-Drone-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How does the camera stabilization work?

Each Qanba drone uses a combination of gyroscopes and accelerometers to stabilize the camera, compensating for slight movements and vibrations that could affect video quality. 

The stabilization system works effectively within a 10-meter range, keeping the camera steady even during short flights or when the user is moving slightly. 


### What is the flight time like?

Standard Qanba drones offer approximately 15 minutes of flight time on a single charge, which is sufficient for most casual shooting sessions. 

The flight duration can extend to 20 minutes with larger capacity batteries, though these require additional purchase. 

![Qanba-Drone-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Qanba-Drone-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can the drone be used in windy conditions?

Wind resistance varies by model, with some Qanba drones performing well up to 15 mph wind speeds. The arm and camera mount are designed to reduce impact from gusts. 

Users should avoid flying in heavy winds or storms, as even stabilized cameras may struggle to capture clear footage under these conditions. 


### Is setup and maintenance complicated?

Setup is straightforward, requiring a basic connection to the companion app via Wi-Fi and loading the battery. After that, most functions are controlled through the app's interface. 

Maintenance primarily involves checking the battery health and cleaning the camera lens after use. The extendable arm and drone body benefit from occasional inspection for wear and tear.
