Silver glitter stars twinkle on these vintage Havana Ray sneakers, while pink stripes add a playful pop at the heel. The synthetic-upper footwear features a slim profile with extra-wide sizing options, though some may find the fit on the tight side.

The Forever sneaker from Vintage Havana combines a smooth leather upper with striking cheetah-print calf hair panels and a side star patch, creating a memorable statement shoe. The low-top silhouette features a slip-on design with no-tie laces, while the lightly cushioned footbed and slightly chunky outsole create a comfortable, modern look that's surprisingly versatile for both casual and dressed-up occasions.

## Buyer's Guide

Vintage Havana sneakers blend classic design elements with a touch of Cuban charm. Understanding key features will help you find authentic pairings that offer both style and comfort. 


### Authenticity and Condition

Original Havana sneakers feature distinct characteristics such as natural rubber soles, canvas uppers, and leather accents. Look for properly stitched detailing and the trademark Havana logo. The condition should show signs of regular wear rather than excessive damage.

### Size and Fit

These sneakers typically run small, so consider ordering a half-size larger than your standard footwear measurement. Check for proper arch support and toe room, as vintage pairs may not offer the same level of cushioning found in modern footwear. 


### Color and Pattern Preservation

Authentic Havana sneakers feature rich brown leather with subtle Havana branding. Natural fading and minor scuffs are expected, but avoid pairs with excessive wear or discoloration. The canvas upper should maintain its shape without sagging.

Vintage Havana sneakers range from $50 to $200 depending on condition and provenance. Be wary of significantly lower prices, as they may indicate counterfeit items. Consider the total cost including shipping and any additional documentation.
