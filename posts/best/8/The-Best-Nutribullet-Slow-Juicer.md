## Buyer's Guide

A Nutribullet Slow Juicer combines powerful blending capabilities with slower speed settings to produce juice while retaining more fiber from fruits and vegetables. The slow juicing process helps maintain enzymatic activity and nutrient content compared to high-speed alternatives. This guide examines essential aspects of Nutribullet Slow Juicers, helping you select the right model for your dietary needs. 


### Core Features and Capabilities

Nutribullet Slow Juicers typically offer multiple speed settings, with lower speeds dedicated to juicing and higher speeds for blending. The included juicer attachments allow you to extract juice from both soft and hard produce. Most models come with several preset programs for different juice types, automatically adjusting speed and timing.

### Versatility and Portability

The blender component of Nutribullet Slow Juicers doubles as a portable drink maker, making it convenient for both home and on-the-go use. Many models feature travel-friendly accessories such as portable blending cups that can be charged and used without power. The blender base often includes multiple settings for smoothies, soups, and purees beyond juicing capabilities. 


### Capacity and Workspace Requirements

Standard capacity ranges from 12 to 20 ounces per cycle, suitable for single servings or quick batch juicing. The juicer base typically occupies minimal counter space, while the blending component requires slightly more room when not in use. Consider your juicing frequency when selecting a model that matches your kitchen workspace.

### Maintenance and Cleaning

Most Nutribullet Slow Juicers feature dishwasher-safe parts for easy cleaning, though the motor base needs careful handling to avoid water damage. The juicing mesh filters are reusable but require regular cleaning and occasional replacement. Proper maintenance of blades and juicing components ensures optimal performance and longevity. 


## FAQ

![Nutribullet-Slow-Juicer-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Nutribullet-Slow-Juicer-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Is the Nutribullet Slow Juicer worth the investment?

The Nutribullet Slow Juicer offers several advantages over standard juicers, including shorter processing times and less foaming. However, it's slightly larger and more expensive than some other models. 

Most users find the extra capabilities worth the initial investment, especially for those who also need a blender. The premium price reflects the additional features and durability of the product. 


### Does the slow juicing process remove more nutrients?

Research indicates that the slower juicing process can retain more nutrients compared to high-speed blending. The Nutribullet's system breaks down cell walls without generating excessive heat or oxygen exposure, which can degrade nutrient content. 

While nutrient retention varies with each fruit and vegetable, the slow juicer generally provides a more nutritious extraction method. 

![Nutribullet-Slow-Juicer-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Nutribullet-Slow-Juicer-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What maintenance requirements are there for the slow juicer?

The unit itself requires minimal maintenance. The blades and feed chute need regular cleaning to prevent residue buildup and maintain performance. The included brush makes quick work of these tasks. 

The juicer's detachable parts should be hand washed after each use. The motor housing and base need occasional cleaning with a damp cloth to remove surface residue. 


### Can the Nutribullet handle tough stems and seeds?

While the Nutribullet is capable of processing some tough stems and seeds, its primary design focuses on soft fruits and vegetables. It's best suited for items like carrots, apples, and celery rather than items with excessively tough cores. 

Hard materials can damage the blades and affect performance. If you frequently need to juice items with tough stems, consider a specialized juicer designed for that purpose. 

![nutribullet-slow-juicer-1](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/nutribullet-slow-juicer-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What's the difference between the slow juicer and regular blender?

The Nutribullet Slow Juicer combines elements of both a slow juicer and a blender. It processes items more slowly than a regular blender to reduce foam and retain nutrients, but it's not as specialized for slow juicing as dedicated systems. 

Unlike a standard blender, it's designed to handle softer fruits and vegetables without heating, making it suitable for both juice and smoothie making. 


### How long does the Nutribullet's motor last?

The motor in the Nutribullet Slow Juicer is built to last, with many users reporting decades of reliable performance. The company backs it with a warranty, though the typical lifespan extends well beyond the warranty period. 

To maintain motor longevity, avoid overloading the unit and ensure proper ventilation. Regular maintenance of other parts can also prevent issues that might affect motor performance.
