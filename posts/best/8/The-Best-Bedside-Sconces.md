These wall sconces combine modern LED technology with a sleek black finish and clear acrylic shade to create a soft, energy-efficient glow.

### [Phenas Creative Humanoid Wall Light Fixtures](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Bedside+Sconces?utm\_term=phenas-creative-humanoid-wall-light-fixtures)

![Phenas Creative Humanoid Wall Light Fixtures | Image](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcTn6m5c1tT7hbeRIitakQ21Ieqt\_462qjIJBllObWal4kfs2qbHvIn\_nUCmkCOnRo4tfd0audHFXuU7vN8MCilC0HAqxz\_d&usqp=CAY)

A cute humanoid wall light fixture that doubles as a modern bedside lamp, featuring an ornate iron design with a baked-on paint finish that resists corrosion. The E26 base accepts both Edison bulbs and LED balls up to 60W. While it looks right at home in kids' rooms or cafes, the single light source isn't ideal for task lighting. The surface-wired installation requires some DIYskills, particularly for the push-button wall switch installation.

## Buyer's Guide

Sidelighting transforms your bedside table into a reading nook, setting the perfect mood for a good book. When choosing the right bedside sconce, consider how it will complement your room's style, how it'll function for evening reading, and which features are essential for your needs. 


### Style and Design

Sidelighting fixtures come in a wide range of styles, from traditional bronze finishes to modern brushed nickel. Consider how the fixture's design elements, such as its height, width, and decorative details, will match your bedroom's existing fixtures and decor. The fixture's base size should allow at least 2 inches of clearance between the shade and your nightstand. 

![Bedside-Sconces-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Bedside-Sconces-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Lighting Options

Most bedside sconces offer a choice between incandescent, compact fluorescent (CFL), or LED bulbs. Incandescent bulbs provide warm, ambient lighting and are inexpensive to purchase, but less energy-efficient. LED bulbs are the most energy-efficient choice, offering long-lasting, bright illumination in smaller wattages. Consider your sleep habits and preferred reading light levels when selecting a bulb type. 


### Adjustable Elements

Find fixtures with adjustable components for precise lighting. Some models feature tilting shades that allow you to direct the light where you need it most. Others may include dimmer switches for customizable brightness levels. These features enhance both practicality and aesthetics, ensuring your bedside fixture serves multiple purposes throughout the night. 

![Bedside-Sconces-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Bedside-Sconces-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Installation Considerations

Ensure the sconce's mounting height allows for proper shade positioning without obstruction. Check the fixture's weight capacity matches your nightstand's support. Consider the socket type (bayonet or screw) compatibility with your bulb selection. Proper installation requires access to electrical wiring behind the nightstand, so measure carefully before purchasing. 


## FAQ

![Bedside-Sconces-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Bedside-Sconces-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a bedside sconce?

A bedside sconce is a wall-mounted fixture that provides reading or ambient light for your bedroom. These fixtures typically feature adjustable arms that direct the light toward or away from the user. 

Unlike traditional table lamps, sconces stay put on the wall, creating a clean, clutter-free nightstand while still providing the lighting you need for reading. 


### How do I choose the right color temperature for my bedside sconce?

The color temperature of a light bulb affects the ambiance of your room. Warm white (2700-3000K) creates a cozy, relaxing atmosphere suitable for bedtime reading or meditation. 

Cool white (4000-5000K) provides better visibility for reading but can make the room feel more alert and awake. Consider your personal preference and the primary function of the room when selecting a color temperature. 

![Bedside-Sconces-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Bedside-Sconces-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How much space do I need for a bedside sconce?

Most bedside sconces have a mounting depth of 4-6 inches. Choose a fixture with a longer arm to reach wider beds or to place the light source closer to your reading area. 

The distance between the sconce and your bed should be at least 12-18 inches to prevent glare and ensure comfortable reading height. Wall height should be measured from floor to the center of the fixture. 


### What is the typical voltage requirement for bedside sconces?

The standard voltage for residential fixtures, including bedside sconces, is 120 volts. Always check the fixture's specifications to ensure compatibility with your electrical system. 

Some modern LED sconces may be available in both 120V and 277V options. Make sure the fixture matches your home's voltage to avoid electrical issues or reduced performance. 

![Bedside-Sconces-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Bedside-Sconces-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do I properly hang a bedside sconce?

Start by measuring exactly where you want the fixture to hang. Mark the wall at this point and install mounting brackets for the sconce. The electrical box should support at least 25 times the fixture's weight. 

Attach the mounting hardware, connect the fixture's wires to your home's electrical supply, and secure the sconce to the brackets. Test the fixture before use to ensure proper installation and safety. 


### What maintenance is required for bedside sconces?

Regular cleaning of the fixture's surface helps maintain its appearance and ensures optimal light output. Use a soft cloth and mild soap for cleaning, avoiding harsh chemicals that can damage the finish. 

Check the bulb's condition monthly. Replace burned-out bulbs promptly, and consider changing bulbs when they start to flicker or dim. Always unplug the fixture during cleaning or bulb replacement for safety.
