From the house that brought us Blue De Chanel, this Versace gentlemen's fragrance captures the freshness of Calabrian bergamot and grapefruit, with warm hints of patchouli and black pepper that give it staying power throughout the day.

The tiny 1oz bottle makes it great for travel or touch-ups throughout the day.
