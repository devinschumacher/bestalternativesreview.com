### Motorized Performance

Powered by an optimized motor design, these brushes deliver consistent oscillations between 31,000 and 40,000 strokes per minute, significantly more than manual brushing. The motor maintains this speed across various brush heads and pressure levels. 


### Customization Options

### What makes the Oral B Pro 1000 unique?

The Oral B Pro 1000 combines essential plaque-removing technology with basic features for those just starting their electric toothbrush journey. Its innovative pulsating action effectively cleans while being gentle on gums. 

Key features include three cleaning modes and two-minute countdown timers, helping establish good brushing habits. The handle is ergonomic and rechargeable, with a simple yet effective design. 


### How does the pulsating action work?

The pulsating technology of the Oral B Pro 1000 creates thousands of gentle cleaning motions per minute, far surpassing manual brushing capabilities. This action helps loosen and remove plaque efficiently without harsh scrubbing. 

Each pulsation lasts 40 milliseconds, designed to reach below the gum line and clean both visible and hidden tooth surfaces. The result is a more thorough clean compared to traditional brushing methods.

### What are the three cleaning modes?

Users can choose between three specialized modes: Clean, White, and Sensitive. Clean mode provides a standard deep clean for daily use, while White mode focuses on removing surface stains. Sensitive mode offers reduced pressure for comfort during brushing. 

Each mode automatically adjusts the brush head speed and pulse pattern to target specific dental needs. This feature allows users to tailor their brushing session to their current oral health requirements. 


### How long does it take to charge, and when should I charge it?

The Oral B Pro 1000 charges fully in 3.5 hours using the provided USB-C cable. A full charge delivers approximately seven days of usage based on daily three-minute brushing sessions. The handle lights indicate battery status: green for full, yellow for low, and red for very low. 

It's recommended to charge the toothbrush every night before bed to maintain optimal performance. The LED indicator will warn you when the battery is getting low, prompting you to plug it in for a quick charge before your next brushing session.

### What's included in the box?

The Oral B Pro 1000 comes with the toothbrush handle, one brush head, and the USB-C charging cable. Additionally, some versions include a carrying case and extra brush head options. 

Each purchase usually includes a travel-friendly box that doubles as storage. Basic models stick to the essential items, while premium versions may offer more accessories like a travel pouch and additional brush heads. 


### How should I maintain the toothbrush?

To keep your Oral B Pro 1000 in optimal condition, store it in an upright position with the brush head facing down when not in use. Avoid leaving it in water, as this can damage the motor. 

After each use, remove the brush head and rinse under running water. Store brush heads in a dry toothbrush cup or holder to prevent bacteria growth. Replace the brush head every three months or sooner if the bristles become frayed.
