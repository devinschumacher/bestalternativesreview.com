I recently got my hands on the Kosas Home Benny 18"x18" Throw Pillow in Multi Color, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer for my living space. The hand-embroidered design adds a touch of artisanal charm, and the 100% Belgian flax linen gives it a classic, traditional feel.

The Alexander Home vintage boho global throw pillow feels like a touch of the past in your living room. I love the vibrant colors, and the patterns are just the right amount of geometric for that bohemian vibe. 

However, I have to say, it's a bit heavier than your average pillow. It's more of a floor pillow, really â€“ not for your couch! Despite the size, I'm still a fan of its unique style, and it brings an element of global chic to any space. 

Now, my only wish is that it came with the polyester filling instead of just the cover. Other than that, it's a fabulous addition to my home.

Its understated design allowed it to seamlessly integrate with my existing setup, giving my living space an uplifting atmosphere without feeling too over-the-top. 

Additionally, I appreciated how easy it was to care for: simply spot clean when needed. And even though it's a delicate cotton, it's been holding up quite well over time. 

However, despite its durability, I wish they had provided more detailed instructions for spot cleaning, just to ensure that the pillow cover stays looking its best for as long as possible. 

All in all, I'm quite pleased with my experience using the Noble House Beacon Boho Cotton Pillow Cover. The blend of colors, pattern, and sturdiness has made it the perfect addition to my living space.

I recently had the pleasure of trying out the Oversized Reversible Linen Square Throw Pillow with Frayed Edges by Threshold, designed by Studio McGee. Let me tell you, it exceeded my expectations in a variety of ways. First and foremost, the pillow is incredibly soft and comfortable, making it perfect for snuggling up while watching TV or reading a book. 

One of the standout features of this pillow is its reversible design. It comes with two covers, so you can easily switch between cream and a darker neutral shade depending on your mood or the room's color scheme. The frayed edges add a lovely touch of bohemian charm, making the pillow look effortlessly cool and stylish. 

The 24-inch size of the pillow is just right - not too big or too small, but perfectly oversized for maximum comfort. The zip closure on the cover is a thoughtful feature, as it allows for easy removal when it's time for cleaning. And speaking of cleaning, the removable cover makes this pillow a breeze to maintain. 

However, there were a couple of minor drawbacks. While the pillow feels soft and comfortable, it doesn't hold its shape as well as I would have liked. And although the frayed edges are a nice design touch, they can feel a bit rough against the skin, especially after washing. 

Overall, I would highly recommend this pillow to anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable addition to their living space. Its attractive design, soft texture, and convenient features make it a worthwhile investment for both your home and your well-being.

However, with an overwhelming range of options available, deciding which one suits you best can be daunting. In this purchaser's guide, we'll highlight significant features, aspects, and general advice to guide you in selecting the perfect boho cushion for your home. 


### Size and Shape

When selecting the perfect boho cushion, the size and shape are essential factors to consider for both comfort and style. Contemplate the dimensions of the cushion and make sure it's appropriate for the space and furniture where it will be positioned. Standard sizes for boho cushions range from 18 inches to 22 inches, with smaller sizes perfect for accent cushions and larger sizes providing a cozier seating experience.

### Filling and Comfort

Boho cushions provide a variety of filling options, which impact both their comfort and structure. Common fillings include down, feathers, polyester, and cotton. Down and feather fillings offer a luxurious and soft feel, making them a preferred option for many. Polyester and cotton fillings are more budget-friendly and durable, offering a more affordable alternative. It's crucial to consider your personal preferences and requirements when selecting a filling, as some may be more allergenic or heavier than others. 


### Material and Design

Boho cushions come in various materials and designs, each adding a unique touch to your space. Some popular materials include cotton, linen, velvet, and suede. Ponder factors such as durability, washability, and texture when picking a material. In terms of design, boho cushions often feature intricate patterns, bold colors, or organic textures. These patterns can be anything from paisley and floral prints to exotic animal or tribal motifs. Select a design that complements the overall style and color scheme of your space.

### Maintenance and Care

To keep your boho cushion in tip-top condition, proper care and maintenance are crucial. Read the manufacturer's care instructions to ascertain the recommended method to clean and store your cushion. Generally, it's best to avoid washing boho cushions with fillings like down or feathers, as overwashing can harm the filling. Spot cleaning using a gentle detergent and warm water is often a safer option. For cushions with outer covers, ensure they are regularly aired out, protecting them from dust, dirt, and potential stains.
