<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Office+Safe?utm_term=steel-security-safe-with-biometric-lock"><img alt="tracker-safe-s12-b2-security-safe-in-black-with-biometric-lock-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tracker-safe-s12-b2-security-safe-in-black-with-biometric-lock-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try out the Tracker Safe S12-B2 Security Safe. The first thing that caught my eye was the sleek design and textured black finish. The build quality seemed solid, with a 14 gauge steel exterior. 

Upon opening the safe, I was impressed by the biometric lock that it comes equipped with. I was able to easily register my fingerprints and access the safe without any issues. Although the keypad backup option is available, it's nice to have the added convenience of a biometric lock. 

One feature I particularly enjoyed was the easy-to-use nature of the safe. The single user codes can be 4-8 digits long, with numbers allowed to be repeated for added security. Additionally, the safe can be secured to the floor or wall, making it even more secure. 

However, there were a couple of downsides. Firstly, the removable shelf was a bit flimsy and didn't feel as sturdy as I would have liked. Secondly, the exterior appeared to have a molded plastic-like finish, which wasn't my preferred choice. 

Overall, the Tracker Safe S12-B2 Security Safe has served its purpose well in securing my valuables. With its biometric lock, easy-to-use keypad and sturdy build, it's a great option for those looking for a reliable and convenient way to store their belongings.
