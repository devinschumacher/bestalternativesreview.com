## Buyer's Guide

Choosing the right black paper towels means finding a balance between quality, absorbency, and value. This guide helps you understand key features and decide which characteristics are most important for your needs. 


### Material Quality

Black paper towels come in different materials, with premium options using uncoated papers that offer better absorbency. Heavier gauge towels typically perform better than thinner alternatives. Check if the product specifies the material weight (gsm) for an objective comparison. 

![Black-Paper-Towels-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Black-Paper-Towels-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Absorbency and Strength

Look for towels with high wet-strength to prevent tearing while maintaining a soft texture. Absorbency ratings can vary; premium black paper towels often exceed 12 grams per sheet when wet. Consider purchasing samples if possible to test both absorbency and tear-resistance in person. 


### Environmental Considerations

Many black paper towels now offer environmental benefits through uncoated paper, recycled content, or sustainably sourced materials. Biodegradable options also reduce waste. While black color can indicate heavier coating, check labels for certified eco-friendly claims. 

![Black-Paper-Towels-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Black-Paper-Towels-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Value and Cost

Calculate total cost per use including purchase price, replacement frequency, and any subscription savings. Premium black paper towels often offer better value despite higher upfront costs. Consider bulk purchasing for homes with higher usage. 


## FAQ

![Black-Paper-Towels-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Black-Paper-Towels-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Why are paper towels made black?

Black paper towels are typically made from recycled materials, and the color comes from adding activated carbon or carbon black pigment. This process enhances their absorbency and makes them ideal for cleaning greasy or oily messes. 

The darker color also helps prevent the transmission of germs by making stains and spills more visible, allowing users to identify and replace soiled towels promptly. 


### Which brands offer black paper towels?

Some popular brands that manufacture black paper towels include Dixie cups, Scott, and Ultra. These brands offer a range of pack sizes from 12 to 120 rolls per pack to accommodate different household needs. 

Scott's Black Diamond and Ultra's Black Diamond are two highly rated options that consistently perform well in absorbency tests conducted by independent researchers. 

![Black-Paper-Towels-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Black-Paper-Towels-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How many sheets are in a black paper towel roll?

Most black paper towel rolls contain 350-400 sheets. The exact number may vary slightly depending on the brand and size of the roll. 

For comparison, a standard 12-pack of 400-sheet rolls provides approximately 4,800-4,800 sheets of paper towels, while a 12-pack of 350-sheet rolls offers about 4,200-4,200 sheets. 


### What is the average cost of black paper towels?

Black paper towels typically cost between $1.50 and $3.00 per 12-pack, depending on the brand and retail outlet. Higher-quality options may command slightly higher prices. 

Brands like Scott and Ultra often offer promotions and bulk buying discounts, which can bring the cost per roll down to approximately $0.50 to $1.00 for a 12-pack. 

![Black-Paper-Towels-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Black-Paper-Towels-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How should black paper towels be stored?

Black paper towels should be stored in a cool, dry place to maintain their quality. Avoid direct sunlight and extreme temperatures that can cause the paper to become brittle. 

For maximum convenience, store rolls in a dispenser that keeps them tangle-free and accessible. This prevents waste and ensures you always have clean towels available. 


### How long do black paper towels last?

Unopened black paper towel rolls typically have a shelf life of 2-3 years from the production date. Once opened, rolls should be used within 6 months to maintain optimal quality. 

Store opened rolls in a sealed container or resealable bag to protect them from moisture and dust. This helps prevent the growth of mold and mildew and maintains the towels' effectiveness.
