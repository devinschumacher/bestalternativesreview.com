## FAQ


### What is an Old English Scratch Cover?

The Old English scratch cover is a protective sleeve designed to wrap around a vehicle's fuel tank, providing an additional layer of defense against scratches and dents. It's made from durable plastic or PVC material that conforms to the tank's shape. 

These covers are commonly found in older vehicles, particularly in garages or storage facilities where scratches are more likely to occur due to poor placement or frequent moving of the vehicle. 


### What types of damage can an Old English scratch cover prevent?

The primary function of an Old English scratch cover is to protect the fuel tank's surface from scratches, swirl marks, and minor dents that can occur during vehicle movement or storage. 

These covers can also help prevent damage from corrosive materials that might spill onto the fuel tank surface, providing an extra barrier between the tank and potential contaminants. 


### How do Old English scratch covers attach to the fuel tank?

Old English scratch covers typically use a combination of friction and sometimes Velcro straps to secure to the fuel tank. The cover is slid over the tank and held in place with the strap system. 

Some newer models may incorporate more advanced attachment methods like clips or magnets, but the traditional friction fit remains the most common design. 


### What is the typical lifespan of an Old English scratch cover?

With regular cleaning and proper installation, an Old English scratch cover can last 5-7 years before showing signs of wear and tear. 

The lifespan can be shortened by exposure to extreme weather conditions, chemical exposure, or improper storage practices like leaving the cover on during washing. 


### Can I install an Old English scratch cover myself?

Yes, installing an Old English scratch cover is a simple process that can typically be done in 15-20 minutes with basic tools. 

You'll need to clean the fuel tank surface, ensure the cover fits properly, and secure it with the included straps or clips. Some models may require more precise measurements for optimal fit. 


### What maintenance is needed for Old English scratch covers?

Regular maintenance involves cleaning the cover with mild soap and water, checking for cracks or warping, and ensuring the attachment system remains functional. 

Inspect the cover annually for signs of aging or damage, and replace it if you notice any significant wear, such as yellowing plastic or fraying straps.
