## Buyer's Guide

Canik holsters offer a practical solution for securing your firearm while maintaining quick access. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the right holster for your needs. 


### Carry Position

Decide whether you prefer concealment or accessibility. Inside-the-waistband (IWB), outside-the-waistband (OWB), or ankle holsters each have distinct advantages depending on your carry preference and clothing style.

### Retention Level

Choose a holster with an appropriate retention level based on your carry location and legal requirements. Drop-proof retention is essential for IWB carry, while OWB holsters may prioritize convenience over maximum retention. 


### Molded vs. Molded-to-Shape

Molded holsters provide basic retention through shape and positioning, while molded-to-shape holsters create a custom fit around the grip and frame for enhanced retention and concealment.
