## Buyer's Guide

Squeezy cheese dispensers are a practical and convenient way to serve cheese at home or in restaurants. These containers keep cheese fresh while making it easy to apply in precise portions. When choosing a squeeze cheese container, several factors come into play, from material durability to design functionality. 


### Material and Construction

The container's material affects both its durability and the cheese's quality. Common materials include high-density polyethylene (HDPE), which is BPA-free and food-safe, and stainless steel, which offers excellent corrosion resistance but is heavier. Glass containers provide superior visibility and are reusable but can break.

### Size and Dispensing Features

Capacity options range from small portable sizes for travel to large containers for catering. Consider a wide-mouth design for easy filling and a precision nozzle for controlled dispensing. Some containers feature built-in scales for measuring specific quantities, while others have adjustable flow control knobs. 


### Closure and Sealing

A secure seal is crucial for maintaining cheese freshness. Look for containers with snap-tight lids or flip-top closures that form a complete seal. Some designs include vacuum-sealing features to maximize freshness, while others may require occasional manual venting to prevent pressure buildup. 

![Squeeze-Cheese-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Squeeze-Cheese-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Maintenance and Cleaning

Materials that are dishwasher-safe simplify cleaning but may not be suitable for all users. For optimal hygiene, choose containers with smooth, easy-to-clean surfaces that prevent cheese residue buildup. Some designs feature removable parts for thorough cleaning, while others require more frequent hand washing. 


## FAQ

![Squeeze-Cheese-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Squeeze-Cheese-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is squeeze cheese?

Squeeze cheese, also known as press cheese, is a style of cheese that has a spreadable, pudding-like consistency. It's made by adding moisture and sometimes additives to cheese to create a convenient, portion-controlled form. 

This cheese can be softer than traditional block cheese and is commonly used for spreadable cheese applications, such as topping crackers or sandwiches. 


### What types of cheese are available in squeeze form?

Squeeze cheese comes in many varieties, including cheddar, mozzarella, cream cheese, and others. Most major cheese manufacturers offer squeezeable versions of their products. 

The specific types available may vary by region and store, so it's worth checking the dairy aisles of supermarkets to find what's locally available. 

![Squeeze-Cheese-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Squeeze-Cheese-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How should squeeze cheese be stored?

Most squeeze cheese varieties require refrigeration after opening to maintain freshness and prevent spoilage. Keep the container tightly sealed when not in use. 

Unused portions will last several days in the fridge, while fully opened containers may keep a week or more with proper storage. 


### Are there any health considerations?

Squeeze cheese is generally safe for most people to consume in moderation. However, individuals with cheese sensitivities or allergies should check ingredients before purchasing. 

Some varieties contain additional ingredients like stabilizers or emulsifiers, so those watching their sodium or additive intake should read labels carefully. 

![Squeeze-Cheese-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Squeeze-Cheese-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Are there any alternatives to traditional squeeze cheese?

Many dairy-free alternatives are available, including almond, cashew, and coconut-based cheese spreads. These can be suitable for vegan diets or those avoiding dairy. 

Beyond alternatives, some manufacturers offer reduced-fat or lower-sodium versions of their squeeze cheese products for those monitoring their nutrition. 


### How does squeeze cheese compare to traditional cheese?

Squeeze cheese is generally milder in flavor and softer in texture than traditional cheese blocks. It's designed for quick serving and spreading rather than slicing. 

While convenient for certain applications, it may not be suitable for cooking or melting. Traditional cheese offers more versatility in use but requires proper storage and handling.
