Evaluate factors such as size, weight capacity, inflation type (manual or electric pump), and any additional safety features like grab handles or impact protection before making a selection. 


### What safety features should I look for in a towable?

Mandatory safety features include proper inflation, secure attachment points for tow ropes, and visible reflective elements. Additional safety enhancements can include grab handles for quick release, impact pads for critical areas, and dual chambers to prevent sinking.

### How do I maintain my boat towable?

Regularly inspect the towable for visible damage, wear, or signs of degradation, particularly in high-stress areas like attachments and seams. Store the towable in a dry place when not in use, and inflate it properly before each use to maintain optimal performance. 

After each use, clean the towable thoroughly to remove saltwater, sand, and dirt, which can damage the material over time. Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for inflation and storage recommendations to extend the life of your towable. 


### What should I consider when buying used boat towables?

When purchasing used towables, inspect them closely for signs of wear, especially in critical areas like handles, straps, and floor surfaces. Avoid units with visible punctures, torn seams, or compromised inflation systems. 

Check the overall condition of the towable's attachments and fittings, as these can affect both performance and safety. Consider the age of the towable, as newer models may offer better materials and safety features than older versions.
