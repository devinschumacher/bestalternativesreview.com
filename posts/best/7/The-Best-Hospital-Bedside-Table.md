### What features should I look for in a hospital bedside table?

Hospital bedside tables need to be sturdy and reliable, with features that enhance both functionality and patient comfort. Key considerations include a smooth, easy-to-clean surface, adequate storage options, and adjustable height capabilities. The material should be durable, such as steel or hospital-grade plastic, to withstand frequent use and disinfection. 

Storage solutions like drawers or shelves can help manage medical supplies and personal items, while wheels or casters allow for easy mobility if the patient needs to move around the room. The table's design should promote proper posture, with the surface at an appropriate height for reading or writing. 


### How can I ensure the bedside table meets hospital standards?

The table should be certified for medical use, meeting standards set by organizations like the Joint Commission or UL Healthcare. Look for surfaces made from antimicrobial materials that resist bacteria and viruses, ideal for healthcare environments. The design should facilitate thorough cleaning and disinfection between uses. 

Manufacturers should provide detailed specifications about material composition, including resistance to scratches, stains, and UV degradation. Additionally, they should offer warranties covering both material defects and workmanship, ensuring long-term reliability in a demanding usage environment.

### What safety features are important for hospital bedside tables?

Edges should be safely rounded to prevent accidental injuries, especially in patient rooms where mobility aids may be in use. The table's legs should be stable, with non-slip bases to prevent tipping, particularly when moving patient care equipment on or near the surface. 

Braking mechanisms on mobile tables are essential for preventing accidental movement when the table needs to be stationary. The construction should support heavy loads without distortion, and the frame should distribute weight evenly to prevent sagging under pressure. 


### How do I choose the right height for a hospital bedside table?

The ideal height ranges from 24 to 28 inches above the floor, ensuring that patients can reach the surface comfortably while sitting in bed. This height allows for natural arm positioning, making it easier to access items and reduce strain during use. 

Adjustable height features are particularly valuable in hospitals where patients may be at different stages of recovery or mobility. This feature enables caregivers to set the table at optimal heights for specific tasks, from medication administration to personal care activities.

### What are the space-saving options available for hospital bedside tables?

Tables with foldable legs can significantly reduce the footprint when not in use, making them ideal for rooms with limited space. Some models feature slim profiles or can be mounted on the wall, freeing up floor space while still providing essential storage and surface area. 

Multi-functional designs, such as those with hidden storage compartments or adjustable surfaces, maximize space efficiency. These innovations help hospitals manage limited room sizes while maintaining essential patient care functionality. 


### How should I maintain a hospital bedside table?

Regular cleaning with appropriate disinfectants is essential for maintaining hygiene standards. The surface should be wiped down daily with soap and water, followed by an appropriate hospital-grade disinfectant suitable for medical environments. 

Storage areas should be emptied and cleaned regularly to prevent buildup of debris or dust. When not in use, the table should be returned to its proper height and locked in place to prevent unauthorized movement or damage.
