## Buyer's Guide

Madewell sunglasses combine vintage styling with modern comfort, offering a distinctive blend of affordability and quality. Understanding the key aspects will help you select a pair that matches both your style preferences and practical needs. 


### Frame Materials and Construction

Madewell frames are available in several materials: acetate offers lightweight durability, nylon provides a more substantial feel, and stainless steel frames combine premium quality with lasting strength. The construction quality can vary between these materials, so higher-end models typically feature reinforced temples and precise nose padding for improved comfort during extended wear. 


### Lens Options and UV Protection

Standard Madewell lenses block 100% of UV rays, protecting your eyes while maintaining clear vision. For enhanced visual performance, consider polarized lenses which reduce glare from reflective surfaces like water or pavement. Photochromic lenses automatically adjust their darkness based on lighting conditions, making them useful for changing environments. 


### Care and Maintenance

Proper maintenance extends the life of your Madewell sunglasses and keeps them looking their best. Store them in the included case when not in use to protect the frames and lenses. Clean the lenses gently with a microfiber cloth or specialized lens cleaner to remove dirt and oils. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials which can scratch the lenses or damage the frame finish. 


### Size and Fit Considerations

Madewell offers multiple size options to ensure a comfortable fit for various face shapes. Measure your head circumference at the largest point between the ears to determine your frame size. The glasses should sit flat on your nose with minimal pressure, and the arms should lie smoothly against your ears without pinching. If you prefer a slightly snugger fit, consider sizes 1-2 steps smaller than your head measurement. 


## FAQ


### What materials are used in Madewell sunglasses?

Madewell uses a combination of acetate and nylon for their sunglass frames, providing both durability and flexibility. 

The lenses are made from polycarbonate or Trivex material, offering excellent impact resistance and UV protection. 


### How do I care for my Madewell sunglasses?

Clean your sunglasses with a soft, lint-free cloth or a microfiber cloth specifically designed for eyewear. 

Avoid exposing your sunglasses to extreme heat, harsh chemicals, or abrasive materials, which can damage the frame and lenses. 


### What sizes are available for Madewell sunglasses?

Madewell offers multiple frame sizes to accommodate different face shapes and styles, typically ranging from size 4 to 6. 

Most styles come in sizes 4, 5, and 6, while some collections include additional sizes 2 and 3. 


### Does Madewell offer lens tint options?

Madewell provides several lens color options, including classic gray, brown, and black, which can affect both appearance and visual comfort. 

Most styles offer basic photochromic properties that automatically darken in sunlight, enhancing UV protection and visual clarity. 


### Are Madewell sunglasses suitable for water sports?

Madewell's polarized lenses reduce glare from water surfaces, making their sunglasses suitable for water sports activities.

### How do I know which size and style will fit me best?

Measure the circumference of your head at the level where you want your sunglass frame to sit, typically just above your ears.
