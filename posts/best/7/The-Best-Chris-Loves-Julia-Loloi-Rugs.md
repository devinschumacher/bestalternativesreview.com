## Buyer's Guide

Loloi's Chris Loves Julia collection offers a blend of comfort and visual interest through its plush construction and intricate patterns. When selecting a rug from this series, consider several key factors to ensure you choose a quality option that matches your space's needs. 


### Size and Scale

The right rug size can significantly impact the room's flow and proportions. Measure your space before selecting a rug to ensure it feels both welcoming and appropriately scaled. For living rooms, consider a rug that extends about 24 inches beyond the largest piece of furniture in all directions. In smaller spaces, a runner or smaller area rug can add warmth without overwhelming the room.

### Pile Height and Density

Chris Loves Julia rugs come in various pile heights, from ultra-soft to medium density. Thicker piles are excellent for high-traffic areas and bedrooms, while thinner options work well in offices or guest spaces where comfort is less of a priority. Consider the room's use and your personal preference for softness when selecting the appropriate pile height. 


### Color and Pattern Selection

The collection features rich earthy tones and detailed patterns. When choosing colors, consider how they interact with your existing décor and lighting. Warmer tones complement wood and brick, while cooler shades work well with marble and stone floors. The pattern's scale should match the room's size - larger patterns suit bigger spaces, while smaller patterns work better in tighter rooms.
