The New Balance 327 takes classic '70s running shoe design and gives it a modern twist. The women's version of this sneaker features a sleek brown finish with striking asymmetrical 'N' branding and aggressive outsole lugs that give it a trail-inspired look. Like many reviewers have noted, sizing can be tricky - some find them a bit too roomy, while others need to size up to get a proper fit. Those with wide feet might have an easier time though, as the generous toe box provides plenty of room. The rubber sole offers decent grip, but don't expect the same level of performance as dedicated running shoes. Overall, it's a stylish addition to the brand's popular 327 lineup, though finding your perfect pair might take some trial and error.
