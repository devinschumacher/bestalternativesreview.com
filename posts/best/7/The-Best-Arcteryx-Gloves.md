## Buyer's Guide

Arcteryx gloves combine exceptional warmth with remarkable dexterity, making them a popular choice for winter sports and extreme cold-weather conditions. Understanding their key features will help you select gloves that match your specific needs and activities. 


### Insulation Materials

Arcteryx uses advanced materials like PrimaLoft and Thinsulate for superior warmth retention without excessive bulk. The construction often features multiple layers: a main insulating layer, wind-blocking fabric on the outer layer, and moisture-wicking liners. 


### Hand and Finger Design

Most Arcteryx gloves have a slightly longer hand length for better warmth, with minimal cuff overlap. The finger designs vary: some models offer separate finger compartments for enhanced dexterity, while others use a mitten-style construction for maximum warmth. 


### Water Resistance and Moisture Management

Outer materials typically include water-repellent coatings or treatments to prevent snow and moisture from penetrating. Inner layers often have moisture-wicking properties to keep hands dry during intense activity. Some models feature vented thumb areas to prevent fogging. 


### Fit and Adjustability

A proper fit is crucial for Arcteryx gloves - oversized gloves can be cold and restrictive, while undersized ones compromise dexterity and warmth. Most models offer adjustable wrist closures, thumb tabs, or hook-and-loop straps for customizable fit. 


## FAQ


### What makes Arcteryx gloves different from other outdoor gloves?

Arcteryx gloves combine premium materials with advanced construction techniques, resulting in exceptionally durable, moisture-wicking, and temperature-regulating gloves suitable for harsh environments. The brand's commitment to sustainability is evident in their use of recycled materials and Bluesign® approved fabrics. 

Key features include reinforced fingertips, breathable membrane layers, and ergonomic designs that enhance grip and dexterity while providing crucial protection against the elements. 


### How do Arcteryx's waterproofing technologies work?

Waterproofing in Arcteryx gloves is achieved through a combination of membrane technology and seam sealing, where the waterproof/breathable layer (commonly Gore-Tex PrimeFit) is bonded directly to the outer shell fabric. This eliminates bulky seams and creates a continuous barrier against water infiltration. 

Seams are sealed using Arcteryx's proprietary Taped construction, which applies an additional waterproof coating to the areas most prone to leaks, such as zipper pulls and thumb channels. 


### What should I consider when choosing an Arcteryx glove?

The primary consideration is intended use. Arcteryx offers specialized gloves for climbing, skiing, mountaineering, and general outdoor activities, each optimized for specific conditions and tasks. Hand size and shape are also crucial, as gloves that are too loose can allow water ingress, while those that are too tight can restrict blood flow. 

Additional features to consider include climate-specific insulation options (like PrimaLoft® or synthetic blends), moisture management capabilities, and tactical elements for performance-based activities. 


### How should I care for my Arcteryx gloves?

Regular maintenance is essential for preserving the performance and longevity of Arcteryx gloves. After each use, wipe down the exterior with a damp cloth and allow them to air dry naturally away from direct heat sources. Avoid using detergents or harsh chemicals, which can damage the waterproof coating and membrane. 

For extended storage, stuff the gloves with crumpled newspaper to maintain their shape and protect them from compression damage. If the gloves become wet, hang them to dry completely before storing to prevent mold and mildew growth. 


### What sizing options are available in Arcteryx gloves?

Arcteryx offers a comprehensive sizing chart that matches each glove model to specific hand sizes and shapes. Most models come in multiple width options (Regular, Wide, Extra Wide) to accommodate different hand profiles. Women's-specific models may have additional sizing variants to account for differences in palm width and finger length. 

It's recommended to measure your hand using a flexible measuring tape before ordering, focusing on wrist circumference and middle finger length. The brand's Size Guides provide detailed measurements for each model to help determine the right fit. 


### How do I know if my Arcteryx gloves need replacement?

Signs that indicate it's time to replace your Arcteryx gloves include significant wear on the fingertips, loss of waterproofing, reduced breathability, or discomfort during use. The gloves should still maintain their original shape and elasticity. Check for signs of degradation around the seams, especially in high-wear areas like the thumb channel and zipper pulls. 

Quality Arcteryx gloves typically last 3-5 years with regular use, depending on the frequency of use and care. If you notice a decline in performance or if the gloves no longer feel comfortable, it's a good indicator that replacement is needed.
