## Buyer's Guide

Cep compression socks combine graduated pressure with moisture-wicking fabrics to enhance circulation and prevent swelling, making them popular among travelers, athletes, and individuals with certain medical conditions. Understanding their features and benefits helps you select the right pair for your needs. 


### Key Features

Graduated compression (most pressure at the ankles, decreasing up the calf) promotes blood flow while preventing vein strain. The sock's construction typically includes moisture-wicking materials like polypropylene to keep feet dry, and reinforced stitching in high-wear areas. 

Elasticated bands at the top secure the sock without causing discomfort, while the sock's length (ankle, crew, or knee-high) depends on your specific needs and activities. Some models offer additional features like padded footbeds, antimicrobial treatments, or specific arch support. 


### Pressure Options

Compression levels range from light (15-20 mmHg) for general comfort and improved circulation to more intense options for medical use. Light compression is suitable for most active individuals, while higher pressures may be prescribed for specific medical conditions. 

For travel-related swelling, moderate compression (20-30 mmHg) provides additional benefits. Medical-grade compression requires a prescription, typically ranging from 30-40 mmHg for severe cases like chronic venous insufficiency. 


### Materials and Construction

High-quality compression socks use blend fabrics that combine elasticity with moisture management. Common materials include polyester, nylon, and spandex, with variations in blend ratios affecting both comfort and durability. 

Look for reinforced stitching around the heel and toe to prevent wear, and consider the sock's construction for your specific activity. The legging band's material and design affect how well the sock stays in place during movement. 


### Evaluation and Fit

Proper fit is crucial for effective compression. Socks should feel snug but not constricting, with no bunching at the top or bottom. The arch support, if present, should sit correctly under your arch without shifting during wear. 

Check the sock's length for comfort and functionality - too short may provide less support, while excessively long can bunch up around the ankles. Following the manufacturer's sizing recommendations ensures a proper fit based on foot and leg measurements. 


## FAQ


### What makes Cep compression socks unique?

Our compression socks are designed to provide graduated pressure support, with the most pressure at the ankles and decreasing towards the top of the sock. This patented design helps improve blood flow and reduce leg fatigue during daily activities and exercise. 

The premium materials used in Cep socks are moisture-wicking and quick-drying, keeping your feet cool and comfortable during long days on your feet. Each pair is also reinforced in high-stress areas like the toes and heels to extend the life of the socks. 


### Do Cep compression socks require machine washing?

Yes, machine washing is recommended for Cep compression socks to maintain their shape and compression properties. Use a gentle cycle and cold water to preserve the elasticity of the material. 

Avoid using bleach or fabric softeners, as they can damage the compression fibers. Instead, opt for mild detergent and consider washing them separately to prevent tangling with other socks. 


### How long do Cep compression socks typically last?

With proper care, Cep compression socks usually last 3-6 months, depending on usage frequency and wear pattern. Heavy daily use may shorten their lifespan, while occasional use can extend it. 

Signs that indicate it's time to replace your socks include visible thinning of the material, loss of compression pressure, or the formation of holes or runs in the seams or toes. 


### Can Cep compression socks be worn with prescription shoes?

Our compression socks are designed to fit comfortably under most prescription shoes, including orthopedic footwear. The double-elastic construction allows for a secure and comfortable fit while maintaining proper compression levels. 

For the best results, choose a sock size that is one size smaller than your regular shoe size. This ensures the compression remains effective without bunching up inside your shoes. 


### Are Cep compression socks suitable for all weather conditions?

Yes, Cep compression socks are available in both short- and long-sleeved options to accommodate various weather conditions. The moisture-wicking properties help keep your feet dry in warmer conditions, while the thermal insulation provides warmth during colder weather. 

Our socks dry quickly, making them ideal for changing seasons or travel. However, it's important to note that the compression properties may be reduced when the socks are wet. 


### Who should avoid wearing Cep compression socks?

Individuals with circulatory problems, such as deep vein thrombosis or poor circulation, should consult their doctor before wearing compression socks. These conditions may require specific medical compression levels that differ from our standard options. 

People with significant foot deformities, open wounds, or severe allergies to natural rubber latex should also avoid wearing Cep compression socks. Always perform a patch test on a small area of skin before regular use to check for allergic reactions.
