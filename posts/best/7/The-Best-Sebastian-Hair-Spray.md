## Buyer's Guide

Hair spray is essential for maintaining hairstyle integrity and combating humidity. When choosing the right hair spray, consider the hold strength, product type, and specific hair needs. Hold strength ranges from light to strong, with sprays labeled accordingly. Product types include clear, colored, and styling sprays, each serving distinct purposes. Hair-specific considerations focus on styling needs, scalp compatibility, and product ingredients. 


### Hold Strength

Hold strength determines how firmly the hair spray maintains your style. Light hold is ideal for everyday styling and adjustable looks, while strong hold suits formal events and long-lasting styles. Medium hold offers versatility between the two extremes, making it suitable for most occasions. 


### Product Types

Market options span clear, colored, and styling sprays. Clear sprays provide hold without altering the hair's appearance, making them ideal for daily use and natural hair colors. Colored sprays add shine and enhance hair color, perfect for blonde highlights or light-colored hair. Styling sprays combine hold with texture creation, useful for achieving specific looks like volume or waviness. 


### Styling Needs

Consider your hair type and styling goals when selecting a hair spray. Fine hair requires lighter products to avoid weighing it down, while thick hair may need stronger hold. Curly hair benefits from products with conditioning properties, while straight hair can use more styling-focused formulas. Scalp sensitivity calls for fragrance-free and hypoallergenic options to prevent irritation. 


### Product Ingredients

Key ingredients include hold polymers, alcohol for setting, and humectants for moisture retention. Hold polymers create the desired level of stiffness. Alcohol evaporates to lock the style in place, while humectants attract moisture to prevent dry, brittle hair. Pay attention to additional ingredients like fragrance, which can cause scalp irritation in sensitive individuals.

### How should Sebastian Hair Sprays be applied for best results?

For most formulas, apply a small amount of spray from a distance of 10-15 inches away from the hair, working the product through the mid-lengths to ends. Start from the top of the head and work downward for uniform hold. 

Avoid direct application to the roots to prevent greasy buildup and ensure a natural-looking finish. The best results come from using the right product for your specific hair type and style goals.

### How long do Sebastian Hair Sprays typically last before needing replacement?

Sebastian Hair Sprays generally last 6-12 months when stored properly in a cool, dry place. The spray may become less consistent or may stop producing a steady stream after this period.
