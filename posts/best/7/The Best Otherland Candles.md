## Buyer's Guide

The Otherland Candles collection offers a curated selection of scented candles, each designed to transform your living space. Understanding the key aspects of these candles will help you choose the right ones that best suit your preferences and needs. 


### 1. Fragrance Selection

Choose candles with fragrances that align with your personal preferences. The collection features a variety of scents from floral and fruity to earthy and woody notes. Consider whether you prefer subtle, medium, or strong scents, as intensity can vary between formulations. 


### 2. Size and Style Options

Select candles that match your storage space and decorative style. The collection includes various sizes from travel-friendly miniatures to centerpiece-worthy large formats. Consider the candle's height-to-diameter ratio, as taller candles may not perform as well in diffusers. 


### 3. Quality of Materials

Invest in candles made with high-quality materials for both performance and longevity. Opt for those with natural cotton wicks and soy wax blends, as these typically provide better burn characteristics and environmental benefits compared to synthetic alternatives. 


### 4. Scent Throw and Diffusion

Evaluate how effectively a candle releases its fragrance into its surroundings. Higher-quality candles achieve better "scent throw" and diffusion patterns, meaning the scent is more widely distributed throughout the room. Consider whether you need a candle that works in a diffuser or for simple room scenting. 


## FAQ


### What is Otherland Candles' mission?

Our mission is to create handcrafted candles that blend natural ingredients with modern design, bringing warmth and fragrance to your space. Each candle is made from premium soy wax and features unique scents inspired by botanical and natural elements. 

We're committed to sustainability and ethical practices, using recyclable packaging and sourcing materials from environmentally responsible suppliers. By burning an Otherland candle, you're not just getting a beautiful scent, but supporting a greener, more conscious approach to home fragrance. 


### What makes Otherland candles unique?

Our candles stand out through their commitment to natural ingredients and sustainable practices. Unlike many candles on the market, we avoid paraffin and artificial fragrances, instead using pure soy wax and essential oils derived from botanical sources. 

Each candle is hand-poured and features a unique scent profile inspired by natural elements. From fresh pine forests to tropical gardens, our fragrances captivate and relax, creating truly immersive experiences. 


### What's the burn time like?

At 16 oz, an Otherland candle will burn for approximately 70-80 hours, depending on how consistently it's burned. This generous burn time makes them an economical choice compared to many other candles on the market. 

To get the most out of your candle, always allow it to burn until the wax reaches the edges of the container - this 'melting' process ensures an even burn pattern and maximizes the fragrance throw. 


### How do I maintain my candle?

Regular maintenance extends your candle's life and enhances its performance. Before lighting, trim the wick to about 1/4 inch. If you notice the flame getting too high, you can extinguish it and trim the wick again to control the burn. 

Avoid placing your candle in drafty areas as this can cause the flame to flicker and affect the burn pattern. Keep the candle away from walls and other surfaces to prevent any potential wax drips. 


### What scents are available?

We offer a diverse range of scents inspired by nature, including Pine Forest, Ocean Breeze, Jasmine Flower, and Fresh Mint. Each scent is designed to create a relaxation response and enhance your environment. 

Our scents change seasonally, so you can look forward to new fragrance options throughout the year. Whether you're into earthy woods or floral blends, there's an Otherland candle scent for you. 


### Are they safe for my home?

Our candles are crafted from natural soy wax and essential oils, making them a safer alternative to paraffin candles. They release no harmful chemicals during burning and are non-toxic to pets and humans. 

That said, as with any open flame, use caution when burning candles. Keep them away from fabrics, curtains, and other flammable materials. Extinguish the candle if the flame gets too high or flickers uncontrollably.
