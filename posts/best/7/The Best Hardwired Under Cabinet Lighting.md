## Buyer's Guide

Hardwired under cabinet lighting transforms kitchen countertops and storage areas into functional works of art. Understanding the basics of this installation will help you choose the right fixtures for your space. 


### Power Requirements and Compatibility

Under cabinet lights typically draw between 12 and 20 watts per fixture, depending on the bulb type. Check your home's electrical capacity before installation. Use fixtures designed for your specific ceiling height and cabinet configuration. Always wire according to local electrical codes and use appropriate junction boxes. 


### Bulb Options and Brightness

Common bulb types include LED, CFL, and halogen. LED bulbs are the most energy-efficient and have the longest lifespan, starting at around 25,000 hours. Consider the room's purpose when selecting brightness levels (measured in lumens). Task lighting below countertops should range from 400 to 1,000 lumens per fixture. 


### Installation Complexity and Tools

Basic installation requires a drill, wire stripper, and screwdriver. For more complex setups, you may need a voltage tester, wire nut kit, and insulated wiring. Consider professional installation for multi-circuit systems or if electrical work is required. Factor installation time into your budget and timeline. 


### Design and Style Considerations

Choose fixtures that complement your cabinet style and color. Opal or frosted glass diffusers create soft, indirect lighting, while clear glass provides precise task illumination. Track systems allow flexible lighting placement and can accommodate multiple fixtures without additional drilling. 


## FAQ


### What is hardwired under cabinet lighting?

Hardwired under cabinet lighting is a permanent installation that mounts directly beneath kitchen or bathroom cabinets. Unlike their plug-in counterparts, these fixtures require professional installation to connect to your home's electrical system. 

The installation process typically involves running electrical conduit from your breaker panel to the cabinets, mounting junction boxes, and wiring each fixture individually. This creates a clean, professional look while providing even, directional lighting perfect for task areas like countertops or vanities. 


### Are hardwired fixtures safe to install?

While home electrical projects can be safe with proper knowledge and tools, installing hardwired under cabinet lighting requires understanding electrical principles and code requirements. Incorrect wiring can lead to electrical shock, fire hazards, or equipment damage. 

For most homeowners, it's recommended to hire a licensed electrician to perform the installation. This ensures compliance with local electrical codes and provides peace of mind regarding your home's safety standards. 


### What types of under cabinet fixtures are available?

Common fixture styles include surface-mount fixtures that clip onto the cabinet bottom, flush-mount fixtures that sit directly against the cabinet surface, and semi-flush fixtures that extend slightly beyond the cabinet for added illumination. 

Many manufacturers also offer specialized fixtures like LED strips, wall washers, or accent lights that can create unique visual effects while maintaining proper illumination levels. 


### How do you choose the right fixtures?

The correct fixture height depends on your cabinet type and desired lighting effect. Standard cabinet heights range from 24 to 36 inches, with most fixtures measuring between 2 and 6 inches in height. 

Consider your specific needs - task lighting for kitchen preparation areas typically requires higher placement, while ambient lighting for bathroom vanities can be lower. Always measure your space before selecting fixtures to ensure proper installation and visual balance. 


### What are the main benefits of hardwired fixtures?

Hardwired under cabinet fixtures provide consistent, reliable lighting without the risk of power loss from extension cords or damaged plugs. They're also more cost-effective over time due to energy-efficient LED technology and the absence of additional power consumption from adapters. 

The professional installation results in a sleek, modern appearance with no visible electrical components, making them ideal for contemporary kitchen and bathroom design. 


### How do you maintain hardwired fixtures?

Regular cleaning is essential to keep your fixtures functioning properly and maintaining their appearance. Use a dust mop or vacuum attachment under cabinets to remove debris, and wipe fixtures with a soft cloth or sponge to prevent accumulation of dirt and grime. 

LED fixtures have a lifespan of 25,000 to 50,000 hours, requiring minimal maintenance. Check fixtures annually for loose connections or damaged wiring, and replace bulbs when they fail to maintain their original brightness level.
