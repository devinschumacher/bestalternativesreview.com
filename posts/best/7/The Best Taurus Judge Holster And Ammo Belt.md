### Installation and Fit

Installation requires measuring your pant waist for the correct belt length and checking the holster's width compatibility with your gun model. The belt installs easily using standard belt loops, while the holster screws on quickly with a 1/4-inch hex key. 

Adjust the holster height to achieve proper concealment while maintaining quick access. The dual retention straps allow fine-tuning of the holster's position on the belt for optimal carry. 


### Carry Considerations

For concealed carry, position the holster low on the hip with the magazine carrier tucked under the belt. The thumb rest should align with your natural hand position for quick draws. 

During activities, check that the holster isn't shifting or binding against the belt. The metal buckle should face inward to prevent snagging and maintain comfort.

### Maintenance and Cleaning

Regularly inspect the holster for wear on straps and screws. The polymer surface can be wiped clean with a damp cloth, while metal parts should be spot cleaned with mild soap and water. 

Apply a thin layer of lubricant to the retention straps and magazine carrier for smooth operation. Store the holster and belt in a dry place away from direct sunlight to prevent cracking or degradation.
