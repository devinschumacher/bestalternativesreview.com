## Buyer's Guide

When selecting a Dewalt multitool, several key factors determine its value and versatility. Understanding these features helps you choose the right tool for your needs. 


### Power Sources

Dewalt offers multitools with three power sources: corded (120V), cordless (18V and 20V Li-ion), and pneumatic. **Corded** tools provide constant power without recharging but need access to an electrical outlet. **Cordless** tools offer greater flexibility, with 20V models typically delivering more power. Pneumatic tools require compressed air but can be as powerful as electric alternatives. 


### Bit Capacity and Holder System

Look for a tool with a bit capacity of at least 1/4" and a system that accepts various adapter attachments for different bit sizes. The **Quick Change System** is efficient but requires additional adapters, while universal systems like **Hex Key Holder** or **Star Wrench System** offer more versatility without extra parts. 


### Tool Features and Accessories

Essential features include torque control, impact drive for tough jobs, and interchangeable collet sizes. Consider a tool with **LED Light** for tough environments and **Storage Clip** for carrying extra bits. A **Voltage Display** helps monitor battery life for cordless models. 


### Build Quality and Warranty

Invest in a tool with drop-tested construction and die-cast gearing for durability. Dewalt's **3-Year Warranty** typically covers manufacturing defects, but larger tools often come with extended coverage. Consider tools with **Corrosion-Resistant Coatings** if you'll use the tool in harsh conditions. 


## FAQ


### What is a Dewalt Multitool?

A Dewalt Multitool is a versatile power tool that combines multiple functions in one portable device. It features interchangeable tools for tasks like driving screws, cutting materials, and measuring distances.

### Can I use my existing Dewalt tools and accessories with this multitool?

If your Dewalt tools and accessories are compatible with 18V lithium-ion batteries, they should work with most Dewalt Multitools. Check the compatibility matrix on the Dewalt website for specific model information. 

Some accessories may be specific to certain models, so it's wise to verify compatibility before purchasing additional tools or attachments. 


### How should I maintain and care for my Dewalt Multitool?

Regular maintenance for a Dewalt Multitool includes keeping the battery charged, storing attachments and tools properly, and cleaning any dust or debris from the tool body.
