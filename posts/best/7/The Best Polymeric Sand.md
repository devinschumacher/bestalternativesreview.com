Techseal EZ Sand makes installing interlocking pavers simple with its built-in binder that prevents weed growth and keeps joints strong. The polymeric sand creates a solid base that resists weather damage, though results can vary based on installation technique and joint width. 


## Buyer's Guide

Polymeric sand is a specialized type of sand used in hardscaping projects, particularly for filling the spaces between interlocking concrete pavers. This binding sand sets through a chemical reaction with calcium chloride, creating a strong bond between paver joints. Understanding the key aspects of polymeric sand will help you select the right product for your paving project. 


### Product Types

Two main types of polymeric sand are available: conventional and blended. Conventional polymeric sand sets through calcium chloride hydration. Blended sand combines calcium chloride with other chemicals for longer-lasting results. Choosing the right type depends on local climate and project requirements. 


### Project Considerations

Carefully measure the joints between your pavers to determine how much sand you'll need. Consider the project location's exposure to foot traffic and weather conditions, as these factors affect sand selection and application timing. Prepare the paver surface by removing weeds, debris, and loose particles before application. 


### Application Process

Application typically requires an edge restrainer to prevent sand loss. Distribute the sand evenly using a broom or sand spreader, then compact it firmly with water-resistant tools. Work in sections to maintain proper moisture levels during setting. Sweeping excess sand from the surface helps prevent clogging of paver joints. 


### Maintenance Requirements

Regular maintenance prevents the growth of weeds and maintains the joint's appearance. Annual cleaning with a pressure washer removes organic matter and maintains joint integrity. Promptly address any joints that become loose or unsightly to preserve the paver's performance and aesthetics. 


## FAQ


### What is polymeric sand?

Polymeric sand is a specialized sandbox material that combines regular sand with a polymer activator. When water is added, it forms a flexible, water-impermeable bond, locking small stone edges together in paver joints. 

This unique property prevents weed growth and water infiltration while maintaining joint flexibility, making it ideal for weather-resistant hardscape installations. 


### How is polymeric sand applied?

The installation process begins with moistening paver joints. The sand is then spread evenly, compacted, and swept into the spaces. Excess sand is removed before the polymer activator is sprinkled on top to initiate the binding process. 

Application typically requires 6 hours of curing time, after which the joints become fully bonded, providing longevity and stability for outdoor paver projects. 


### What are the advantages of using polymeric sand?

The primary benefits include enhanced joint stability, improved walkability on paver surfaces, and prevention of weed growth through its water-blocking properties. The material resists shifting underfoot and maintains its effectiveness over time without regular maintenance. 

Additionally, polymeric sand prevents sand loss that occurs with traditional sand filled joints, ensuring clean, secure paver installations that retain their appearance. 


### Who should use polymeric sand?

This material is particularly suitable for outdoor landscape contractors, DIY hardscaping enthusiasts, and residential property owners looking to install or maintain paver walkways, driveways, and patios. 

Its durable performance makes it ideal for both new installations and existing joint repairs, though it's important to note that it may not be appropriate for areas with heavy vehicular traffic or extreme temperature fluctuations. 


### What conditions affect polymeric sand's performance?

Polymeric sand performs best in dry to moderately wet conditions. Extreme cold can prevent the polymer activator from activating effectively, while standing water can wash away the bound sand and compromise joint integrity. 

The material excels in areas with moderate foot and vehicular traffic, maintaining its performance without excessive wear. Installation guidelines must be followed to ensure proper application and curing under varying environmental conditions. 


### How does polymeric sand compare to regular sand?

Regular sand can shift over time, especially under foot traffic and around wet conditions, leading to uneven paver surfaces and increased maintenance. While initially less expensive, it requires regular reapplication and can support weed growth through its permeable structure. 

Polymeric sand offers superior joint stability and water resistance at a similar installation cost. Its long-term benefits include reduced maintenance needs and improved safety due to its walkable, consistent surface.
