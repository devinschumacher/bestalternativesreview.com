## Buyer's Guide

Our Reduce Cups guide helps you make an informed choice about buying cups that minimize environmental impact while meeting your needs. We'll cover key aspects like material, durability, and practical features to help you select a sustainable cup that fits your lifestyle. 


### Material Options

Popular materials include stainless steel, glass, and BPA-free plastic. Stainless steel offers excellent durability and doesn't retain flavors, while glass provides superior visibility. BPA-free plastic cups balance affordability and practicality but may not be as eco-friendly.

### What categories of cups are included in the Reduce Cups collection?

The Reduce Cups collection encompasses a diverse range of cups, including travel mugs, coffee cups, and reusable water bottles. These products are specifically designed to reduce single-use plastic and paper cup consumption. 

This comprehensive selection caters to various daily needs, from morning coffee to road trips, helping users make sustainable choices without compromising on convenience. 


### How do these cups compare in terms of insulation and temperature retention?

Most cups in the Reduce collection feature double-wall insulation, effectively maintaining drink temperatures for 6-8 hours. This keeps hot beverages warm and iced drinks cold, matching the performance of similar premium insulated cups. 

Some specialized cups even include vacuum insulation technology, extending temperature retention to 24 hours for hot drinks and 12 hours for iced drinks, making them ideal for all-day use. 

![Reduce-Cups-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Reduce-Cups-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What materials are used in these cups, and how do they affect durability?

The cups are predominantly made from BPA-free materials, including stainless steel, glass, and food-grade plastic. These materials provide varying levels of durability - stainless steel cups are the most resistant to denting and scratching, while glass options offer superior transparency and ease of cleaning. 

Polycarbonate plastic cups provide a balance of durability and cost-effectiveness, maintaining their shape well under normal use conditions. All materials undergo rigorous testing to ensure longevity and safety. 


### How much space do these cups save in my bag or vehicle?

Thanks to their compact designs and folding features, these cups significantly reduce bulk. Many travel mugs and water bottles can be nested or partially collapsed for easier storage. This space-saving aspect makes them particularly practical for commuters and outdoor enthusiasts. 

The lighter weight of reusable cups also contributes to reduced strain when carrying multiple items, whether in a backpack or vehicle.

### What are the environmental benefits of switching to these cups?

By choosing a reusable cup over single-use alternatives, you can significantly reduce your environmental impact. The average user can prevent over 1,000 plastic cups from entering landfills each year through regular use of a reusable option. 

These cups also reduce energy consumption associated with producing and disposing of disposable cups, contributing to lower greenhouse gas emissions and waste management costs. 


### How should I clean and maintain these cups?

Most cups in the Reduce collection can be hand-washed or placed in the dishwasher for easy cleaning. Special attention should be given to the lids and seals, which may require manual cleaning to prevent residue buildup. 

To maintain optimal performance and hygiene, avoid using abrasive cleaners or steel wool on the interiors. Regular cleaning and proper storage help extend the life of your cups and ensure they remain hygienic for daily use.
