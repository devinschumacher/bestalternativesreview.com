## Buyer's Guide

A right-angle impact driver combines the power of an impact driver with the precision of a 90-degree bit orientation, making it ideal for tight spaces and specialized applications. Understanding its key features and capabilities will help you select the right tool for your project. 


### Power & Torque Specifications

Impact drivers measure their performance through voltage ratings, usually 12V, 18V, or 20V Li-ion. Higher voltage generally correlates with greater torque output. Torque specifications range from 600 to 1,200 inch-pounds, with higher values suitable for heavier-duty applications. 


### Bit Compatibility & Accessory Kit

Standard bits are typically 1/4" or 3/8" drive, though some premium models offer 1/2" options. Evaluate the included bit set to ensure compatibility with your existing tools and accessories. A separate drill chuck can accommodate wider drill bits and special attachments. 


### Compact Design & Ergonomics

Tools with a slim, ergonomically designed handle maximize comfort during extended use, especially in tight spaces. Look for features like a locked-off handle design and finger-friendly contours. The weight distribution should balance power with manageable heft. 


### Charging & Battery Life

Lithium-ion batteries dominate the market for their balance of power and runtime. Evaluate the tool's battery compatibility with other devices in the same family. Consider tools with multi-voltage capabilities for versatile power needs. 


## FAQ


### What is a right angle impact driver?

A right angle impact driver is a power tool that delivers high torque in a compact design, allowing for deep penetration in tight spaces. The "right angle" refers to the 90-degree offset between the handle and the bit, which enables working in confined areas where traditional drills can't reach. 

This versatile tool combines the power of an impact driver with the precision needed for detailed work, making it essential for professionals in construction, automotive, and electronics repair. 


### What are the main benefits of using a right angle impact driver?

Right angle impact drivers excel in tight spaces and deep holes where standard drills struggle. Their reverse mode helps remove stubborn bolts, and the torque settings provide precise control for different applications. 

These tools typically feature interchangeable bits and powerful motor technology, though they're generally less powerful than their straight counterparts and may have shorter battery life. 


### What types of bits can I use with a right angle impact driver?

The most common bits for right angle impact drivers are 1/4-inch and 3/8-inch hex-shank variants. These include drill bits, impacted bits (for heavier-duty tasks), and specialized attachments like screwdrivers and chucks. 

Ensure your bits match the driver's specifications to maintain optimal performance and tool longevity. 


### How do I maintain a right angle impact driver?

To maintain proper function, regularly lubricate the trigger mechanism and clean debris from the chuck. Store the tool properly and check the battery regularly for optimal performance. 

Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for cleaning and maintaining the specific model you own, as different models may have unique maintenance requirements. 


### What are the key factors to consider when choosing a right angle impact driver?

The primary considerations are power output, bit capacity, and ergonomic design. Most users also prioritize battery life, tool weight, and the presence of additional features like LED lighting or torque settings. 

Factor in your intended use case (light, medium, or heavy-duty applications) to select a tool that matches your needs and workspace constraints. 


### How long does a right angle impact driver battery last?

Battery life varies based on usage intensity and the specific tool model. Standard runtime ranges from 15 to 30 minutes per charge, with Lithium-ion batteries providing longer life than older Nickel-Cadmium options. 

Absorbent Glass Mat (AGM) batteries offer superior performance in cold temperatures and require less maintenance, though they typically cost more than regular Lithium-ion batteries.
