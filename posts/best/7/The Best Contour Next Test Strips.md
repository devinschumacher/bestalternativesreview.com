### What are Contour Next Test Strips?

Contour Next test strips are specifically designed for use with Abbott's Contour Next blood glucose monitoring system. These precision-engineered strips enable accurate measurement of glucose levels in the blood, providing essential information for managing diabetes. 

Each test strip combines a thin layer of glucose oxidase with sophisticated chemical processes that react with blood to generate a precise electrical signal. This signal is then converted into a glucose concentration measurement displayed on the Contour Next meter. 


### How do Contour Next Test Strips work?

When a blood sample is applied to the test strip, enzymes on the strip oxidize glucose present in the sample. This reaction generates hydrogen peroxide, which is detected by the strip's sensor. The sensor converts the hydrogen peroxide concentration into an electrical signal that is transmitted to the Contour Next meter. 

The meter processes this signal through advanced algorithms to calculate the glucose concentration in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or millimoles per liter (mmol/L), based on the meter's calibration settings. 

![Contour-Next-Test-Strips-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Contour-Next-Test-Strips-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What makes Contour Next Test Strips different?

The Contour Next system incorporates several innovations to improve test accuracy and reliability. These include a unique two-part design with a separate testing window for each strip, reducing contamination and improving consistency. 

Each strip also contains a built-in quality control feature that checks for correct insertion and proper blood sample application before measuring glucose levels. This ensures that only valid test results are displayed on the meter. 


### How are Contour Next Test Strips priced?

Contour Next test strips typically come in boxes containing 30 or 50 strips, depending on the specific product variant. Pricing varies by region and retailer, but a 50-pack usually costs between $40 and $60 USD, while a 30-pack ranges from $30 to $45 USD. 

The cost per strip is significantly higher compared to some other glucose test strips, with prices around 25-35 cents per strip for a 50-pack. However, this reflects the advanced technology and clinical validation of the Contour Next system. 

![Contour-Next-Test-Strips-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Contour-Next-Test-Strips-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Where can Contour Next Test Strips be purchased?

Contour Next test strips are available through Abbott's official website and authorized retailers worldwide. Many pharmacy chains, diabetes supply stores, and online retailers also carry these test strips. 

Some countries have specific pricing structures, with government programs or health insurance providing coverage for diabetes supplies. It's advisable to check with local pharmacies or healthcare providers for the most accurate pricing information. 


### How long are Contour Next Test Strips effective?

Contour Next test strips have a shelf life of two years from the date of manufacture when stored properly. This includes keeping the strips in their original package and protecting them from extreme temperatures and humidity. 

Once removed from their sealed package, open test strips should be used within 60 days. For optimal performance, it's recommended to store open strips in the refrigerator (between 36-86°F or 2-30°C) to extend their shelf life.
