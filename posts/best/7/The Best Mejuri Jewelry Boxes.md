## Buyer's Guide

Choosing the right jewelry storage solution is crucial for protecting your delicate pieces and maintaining their sparkle. Mejuri jewelry boxes offer an elegant way to store and display your favorite accessories, combining style with practicality. Here's what to consider when selecting a Mejuri jewelry box that matches your needs and lifestyle. 


### Size and Shape Considerations

Mejuri offers various box sizes to accommodate different jewelry collections. Consider the number and size of your pieces when selecting a box. The shape of the box should complement your display space while providing optimal storage. Round boxes work well for compact spaces, while rectangular boxes offer more surface area for display. 


### Material Quality and Construction

Investing in a jewelry box with high-quality materials ensures both durability and protection for your pieces. Look for boxes made from glass or crystal with metal bases for added stability. The interior should feature padded compartments or soft cloths to prevent scratches and damage during storage. 


### Display vs. Storage Options

Consider whether you want a box primarily for storage or display. Display boxes often feature open designs with glass lids, allowing you to showcase your jewelry prominently. Storage boxes typically provide more closed compartments for protecting pieces while minimizing dust exposure. 


### Personal Style and Aesthetics

Select a jewelry box that matches your personal style and home decor. Mejuri offers various design options with different finishes, from matte metal to lacquered surfaces. The box's size, shape, and finish should complement your existing pieces while adding a touch of elegance to your storage solution. 


## FAQ


### What materials are used in Mejuri jewelry boxes?

Mejuri jewelry boxes feature a richly detailed lid crafted from solid hardwood, providing a luxurious centerpiece for your jewelry collection. The interior is lined with soft, protective velvet to prevent scratches and damage. 

Both the lid and sides are finished with an elegant black lacquer, complemented by an adjustable felt-covered rail system that keeps your jewelry organized and secure. 


### How many pieces of jewelry can fit in a Mejuri jewelry box?

The box's generous interior can accommodate approximately 40-50 small to medium-sized pieces of jewelry, depending on their size and shape. 

With its deep compartments and multi-tiered design, the box is particularly well-suited for rings, necklaces, and pairs of earrings. 


### Is the Mejuri jewelry box watertight?

While the box is designed to protect your jewelry from dust and minor scratches, it is not watertight and should not be submerged in water. 

Evaluate the design for its effectiveness in preventing dust and air circulation, which can affect the longevity of your jewelry. 


### Can the jewelry box be personalized?

Each Mejuri jewelry box is shipped with a black ribbon for personalization. The box itself cannot be monogrammed, but you can use the ribbon to create a custom label or attach a note. 

The box also includes an information card about the jewelry box's materials and care instructions, which you can customize with your own notes. 


### What is the return policy for Mejuri jewelry boxes?

If you're not satisfied with your jewelry box, you can return it within 30 days for a full refund, provided that the box is unused and in its original condition. 

Contact Mejuri's customer service to initiate the return process and ensure that you receive a pre-paid shipping label and detailed instructions for returning the box. 


### Are Mejuri jewelry boxes suitable for travel?

Yes, the jewelry box's compact size and protective interior make it ideal for travel. The box includes a telescoping handle for easy carrying and storage. 

However, consider the box's durability during transport and whether the protective features will adequately safeguard your valuable jewelry during travel.
