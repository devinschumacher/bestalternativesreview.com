These sandals combine comfort, durability, and lightweight design to provide a practical alternative to traditional footwear. Understanding the key features will help you select a pair that meets your needs.

### Fit and Sizing

Proper fit is crucial for lasting comfort. Most Jesus sandals run true to size, so measure your foot before purchasing. Consider slightly wider options if you have wide feet or plan to wear socks with the sandals. The heel should sit snugly in place without bunching. 


### Care and Maintenance

Sandals made from quality leather require regular care to maintain their shape and extend their lifespan. Use a leather conditioner monthly to keep the material supple. Wipe down your sandals daily with a damp cloth to remove dust and debris. Store them in a cool, dry place when not in use to prevent warping.

The heel counter plays a crucial role in stability, so choose sandals with a supportive heel cup. This feature helps prevent sliding and provides better balance during walking.
