## Buyer's Guide

Purple nails add a bold pop of color to any manicure, but choosing the right shade and products can make or break your favorite color trend. This guide helps you select a lasting purple polish and proper nail care routine. 


### Choosing the Right Purple Polish

Purple pigments vary widely, from soft lavender to rich eggplant. Consider the occasion and your skin tone to pick a shade that complements your style and complements your natural coloring. Look for polishes specifically formulated for longevity and chip resistance to maintain your look throughout the week. 

![Purple-Nails-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Purple-Nails-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Cleanup and Touch-Ups

After your initial manicure, regular touch-ups prevent ragged edges and maintain a polished appearance. Invest in quality nail scissors and clippers for precise shape definition. A good base coat and top coat system protect your polish investment and keep nails looking fresh longer between applications. 


### Color Coordination

Orange and gold complement most purple shades, while black and dark blue create striking contrasts. Consider the color scheme of your outfit and accessories when choosing your purple nail color. Neutral base colors like white or beige extend the versatility of your purple polish choice. 

![Purple-Nails-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Purple-Nails-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Maintenance Tips

Protect your purple nails from fading by applying a clear top coat every two days. This seals in color and adds shine. Remove old polish with acetone-free nail polish removers to prevent damage. Regular hand moisturizing keeps nails strong and prevents peeling around the cuticles. 


## FAQ

![Purple-Nails-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Purple-Nails-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What colors are considered true purple?

Pure purple is a combination of red and blue, creating a rich, deep shade. Our selection features true purple hues, with some products offering lighter lilac tones while others provide deeper royal purple. 

Our darkest shade is nearly black with purple undertones, while lighter options range from mauve to lavender, allowing you to choose the perfect intensity for your preference. 


### Can these nails be used for both fingernails and toenails?

Yes, all of our purple nail products are suitable for both fingernails and toenails. The only consideration is the size compatibility - make sure to choose a shade and base that works well with the nail area you're coloring. 

Toenails may require slightly longer drying times due to thickness, and some users prefer a slightly thicker base coat for better adherence. Fingernails typically have fewer issues and can be more easily shaped and polished after application. 

![Purple-Nails-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Purple-Nails-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How long do these nails last?

Properly applied purple nail polish typically lasts 7-10 days, with careful maintenance. This duration may vary based on individual nail habits, such as frequent hand washing or nailbiting. 

To extend wear, it's recommended to use good quality base and top coats, avoid soaking your nails in water, and maintain the nails' health through regular moisture and nutrient balance. 


### Are these purple nails easy to remove?

Most of our purple nail products come with both fast-acting and regular remover solutions, making them relatively easy to remove. Fast-acting remover typically works in 1-2 minutes, while regular remover can soften the polish in 10-15 minutes for easier scraping off. 

Common tips for removal include not going back over the same area multiple times to avoid chipping, and using gentle back-and-forth motions to minimize damage to natural nails. 

![Purple-Nails-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Purple-Nails-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What's the difference between nail lacquer and nail polish?

Nail lacquer and nail polish are essentially the same product - both are clear liquids applied to nails to create a base coat. The key difference is in the pigmented shades. 

Purplish nail lacquers contain color pigments, while true nail lacquer maintains clear color clarity. Nail polish typically refers to the fully pigmented version, while nail lacquer is more commonly used for base and accent layers. 


### Are these products safe to use during pregnancy?

Our purple nails products contain ingredients generally considered safe during pregnancy. However, it's important to consult with your healthcare provider before using any new nail products during pregnancy. 

Key ingredients to avoid include formaldehyde, toluene, and DBP (dibutyl phthalate), which are not present in our formula. Always ensure the product is specifically labeled as safe for use during pregnancy.
