## Buyer's Guide

A Blackstone griddle is a versatile cooking appliance that combines grill marks with flat-top cooking surface. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the right size and performance level for your cooking needs. 


### Size and Capacity

The standard Blackstone griddle measures 16 inches by 28 inches, while the larger 17-inch model offers slightly more cooking surface. Consider your meal portions and the number of people you typically cook for when choosing between these sizes. The larger griddle allows more space for cooking multiple items simultaneously. 


### Cooking Surface and Heat Distribution

The cooking surface should be smooth and feature a grid pattern for even heat distribution. The 17-inch griddle maintains consistent temperature across its surface, ideal for cooking burgers, steaks, and vegetables. Look for models with adjustable thermostats and built-in temperature indicators for precise control. 


### Material and Durability

Blackstone griddles are typically made from heavy-duty cast aluminum with a stainless steel coating for lasting performance. The stainless steel surface resists scratches and holds its shine well. Check that the griddle has ergonomic handles and a secure grip to prevent accidents during cooking. 


### Maintenance and Cleaning

Proper maintenance extends the life of your Blackstone griddle and ensures optimal cooking performance. Use non-abrasive cleaners and avoid harsh chemicals that can damage the cooking surface. The griddle comes with a lifetime warranty, but regular care with appropriate cleaning supplies will help maintain its condition over time.
