## Buyer's Guide

Earthy and enigmatic, scarab bracelets blend natural beauty with cultural significance. These pieces draw inspiration from ancient Egyptian symbols, combining polished stones with intricate designs. Understanding the key aspects of scarab bracelets can help you select a piece that resonates with your style and values. 


### Materials and Stones

Most scarab bracelets feature hematite or black onyx stones, symbolizing protection and power. Rarer variations use green stone like malachite for rejuvenation or carnelian for energy. The material's quality impacts durability and visual appeal, with polished stones presenting the best finish. 


### Design and Symbolism

Authentic Egyptian scarab designs incorporate royal blue lapis lazuli or clear glass for the scarab's eye. Modern interpretations use various elements, from simple bands to complex filigree work. Pay attention to the scarab's orientation - forward-facing symbols aid in manifestation, while backward-facing protect against negative energy. 


### Size and Fit

These bracelets typically measure around 8-9 inches in length, with adjustable options available for customization. The stone should fit comfortably in your palm when held naturally. Consider wearing the bracelet alone or stacking it with other wrist accessories. 


### Care and Cleaning

Most scarab bracelet materials require basic care. Wipe with a soft cloth after each wear and store in a dry place to prevent damage. Hematite and black onyx can be cleaned with mild soap and water, while more fragile stones may need professional cleaning to maintain their brilliance.
