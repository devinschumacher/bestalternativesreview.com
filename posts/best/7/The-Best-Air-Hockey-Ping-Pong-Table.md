Some tables incorporate double-D shoot sensors for competitive scoring and improved response time. Consider whether you prefer basic gameplay or advanced features that enhance match intensity. 


### Construction Quality

### Power Consumption and Maintenance

## FAQ

![Air-Hockey-Ping-Pong-Table-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Air-Hockey-Ping-Pong-Table-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is an air hockey ping pong table?

Also known as air hockey tables, these gaming devices combine elements of air hockey and table pong. They feature a smooth surface with circular holes, computer-controlled targets, and fans that create an air cushion for the puck. 

The game involves two players controlling air hockey sticks to strike a plastic puck across the table, scoring goals by hitting the computer targets. The interactive element of the computer opponents and the fast-paced gameplay make it a popular choice for arcade and home entertainment. 


### What are the main components of an air hockey table?

Key components include the playing surface (usually made of tempered glass), air hockey sticks, a plastic puck, computer targets, and fans that create the air cushion. The table also features sensors and electronic scoring systems. 

Each player uses an air hockey stick to hit the puck towards the opponent's target. The computer-controlled targets respond to puck impacts, registering goals and tracking scores. The air system keeps the puck floating just above the surface for smooth gameplay. 

![Air-Hockey-Ping-Pong-Table-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Air-Hockey-Ping-Pong-Table-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How does an air hockey table work?

When the game is turned on, fans beneath the play surface create an air cushion that suspends the puck just above the holes in the table. This allows for smooth, gliding motion while preventing the puck from going through the holes. 

The computer-controlled targets use infrared sensors to detect when the puck hits them, registering goals and updating the score display. Players control their sticks to hit the puck and aim for the opponent's target, with the computer automatically positioning its target based on puck contact. 


### What are the dimensions of an air hockey table?

Standard air hockey tables are typically 48 inches (122 cm) long, 24 inches (61 cm) wide, and 21 inches (53 cm) tall. The playing surface itself measures 47.5 inches (120.7 cm) long and 22.5 inches (57.2 cm) wide. 

The design allows for easy gameplay while keeping the table manageable for home or arcade settings. The slightly smaller playing area compared to regulation ice hockey rinks creates distinct challenges and adds to the game's speed and strategy. 

![Air-Hockey-Ping-Pong-Table-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Air-Hockey-Ping-Pong-Table-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How is scoring determined in air hockey?

Each goal scored against the computer opponent is worth one point. The first player to reach a predetermined score (usually 5 or 10 points) wins the game. Scoring is automatically tracked by the table's electronic system. 

Players can customize the score system, with some tables allowing settings for different game lengths or point values. The electronic display shows both player scores, and the computer target moves to defend its goal, making each game competitive and engaging. 


### What maintenance does an air hockey table require?

The table needs regular dusting of the playing surface and wiping down of the exterior. The fans and electronic components should be checked for proper functioning, with filters cleaned or replaced as needed to maintain optimal air flow. 

Weekly maintenance includes checking the air cushion system for consistent performance, ensuring all electronic components are properly connected, and testing the scoring system. With regular care, an air hockey table can last for many years of enjoyable gameplay.
