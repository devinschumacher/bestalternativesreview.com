Apply Kenneth Cole Reaction cologne to pulse points such as the wrists, neck, and behind the ears for the best results. 

Avoid applying too much in one spot, as this can lead to an artificial or overpowering scent. A few light spritzes across multiple pulse points is ideal.

### What is the recommended usage for Kenneth Cole Reaction cologne?

Use Kenneth Cole Reaction cologne as your primary fragrance, applying once daily unless instructed otherwise by the specific product. 

Avoid layering with other strong fragrances, as this can create an unpleasant chemical reaction and mask the intended scent profile. 


### Are Kenneth Cole Reaction colognes suitable for all skin types?

Most Kenneth Cole Reaction colognes are alcohol-based and may be suitable for most skin types, but individuals with sensitive skin should perform a patch test first. 

If you experience any irritation, redness, or allergic reactions after application, discontinue use and consider a fragrance-free alternative.
