## FAQ


### What are Coach loafers made of?

The leather used in Coach loafers varies by style and price point. Most feature premium full-grain leather uppers that provide durability and a classic look. Some styles incorporate canvas or suede for added texture and feel. 

Many Coach loafers also include synthetic materials for additional durability, particularly in areas that experience wear, like the heel counters and toe caps. The linings and insoles are typically made from breathable materials like mesh or cotton. 


### What styles of Coach loafers are available for women?

Coach offers several women's loafers, including the classic Wallabee, which features a rubber sole and quilted leather upper. Other styles include the Nala, with its moccasin construction and flexible rubber outsole, and the Nala II, which adds a leather overlay for a modern touch. 

Color options range from neutrals like black, white, and brown to deeper tones like navy and burgundy. Many styles offer interchangeable sole options, allowing you to switch between rubber and leather soles based on your preference or occasion. 


### How do Coach loafers compare to other women's loafers?

Coach loafers stand out for their blend of classic design with modern touches. While brands like Toms and Dr. Martens offer quality loafers, Coach's versions typically feature more premium materials and distinctive details like the brand's signature double-C logo. 

When compared to other luxury brands, Coach loafers often offer a more balanced approach to style and affordability. While not as expensive as Gucci or Versace loafers, they provide a similar level of attention to detail and quality construction. 


### What sizes are available in Coach loafers?

Coach offers a standard U. S. sizing chart across their women's loafers, with options ranging from US 5 to 11. The brand often includes half sizes, making it easier to find your perfect fit. Special sizing notes are included for specific styles, such as the Wallabee, which runs slightly smaller than other models. 

For the most accurate size information, it's recommended to consult the product page for your specific style. Coach regularly updates their sizing charts, so it's a good idea to check the latest sizing guide for the most precise measurements. 


### Are Coach loafers comfortable to wear?

Coach loafers are designed with comfort in mind, particularly in styles like the Nala and Nala II, which feature a slightly more relaxed fit than their predecessors. The quilted construction helps distribute pressure evenly across your foot, while the rubber outsoles provide good grip and cushioning. 

While most women find Coach loafers comfortable right out of the box, some may need to break them in slightly, especially if they have wider feet or prefer a looser fit. The brand recommends wearing them in gradually to prevent any potential break-in discomfort. 


### How should I care for my Coach loafers?

Coach recommends cleaning your loafers with a damp cloth and mild soap when needed. For stubborn dirt or stains, they suggest using a soft brush to gently scrub the affected area before wiping clean. The brand recommends avoiding the use of harsh chemicals or abrasive materials that could damage the leather. 

For storage, Coach suggests keeping your loafers in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. If you need to store them for an extended period, consider using a dust bag to protect them from dust and scratches. Regularly applying a leather conditioner can help maintain the integrity and appearance of the leather over time.
