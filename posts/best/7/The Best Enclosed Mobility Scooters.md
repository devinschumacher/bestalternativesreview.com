## Buyer's Guide

Enclosed mobility scooters offer greater protection from weather and elements compared to open designs. Considerations include size dimensions, weather-resistant features, and enclosed storage solutions. The folding mechanism affects portability and storage space requirements. 


### Sized for Weather Protection

These scooters come in standard and compact sizes to fit different vehicle and storage needs. Standard scooters measure around 28-36 inches wide and 54-60 inches long when folded, while compact models reduce width to 24-26 inches and length to 48-54 inches. The lower width and length dimensions make them easier to store in cars and garages.

### Features for Rain and Snow

Look for scooters with sealed electronics, water-resistant controls, and canopy designs that shield the operator. The canopy should sit at least 36 inches above the seating position to provide adequate headroom. Some models feature double-layered canopies with rain channels, while others have integrated windshield wipers or rear window defrosters for snow removal. 


### Storage Solutions

Check if the scooter has built-in storage compartments under the seat or behind the canopy for personal items. The storage capacity ranges from small accessory pouches to larger containers that hold coats, umbrellas, or medical supplies. The design should prevent items from shifting during operation.

### Folding Mechanism

The folding system affects both portability and storage space requirements. Single-fold designs typically reduce the scooter's width to 24-26 inches and length to 48-54 inches, while double-fold models further compress the size. Consider a manual folding system for compact storage or an electric system for easier operation, though electric folding costs more.
