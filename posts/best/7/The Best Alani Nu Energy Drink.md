### Can you explain the ingredients in Alani Nu?

Research has shown that L-theanine helps to reduce stress and promote relaxation, making it particularly beneficial for maintaining calm focus during intense activities. Unlike caffeine, which can cause jitteriness, L-theanine works in synergy with caffeine to enhance cognitive function and reduce mental fatigue.

Avoid consuming multiple servings in quick succession, as this can lead to excessive caffeine intake. Always listen to your body and adjust consumption based on your individual tolerance and activity level. 


### Are there any side effects to consider?

While generally safe for most adults, excessive caffeine consumption can cause side effects such as jitters, rapid heart rate, and difficulty sleeping. Individuals sensitive to caffeine or with pre-existing health conditions should consult a healthcare provider before use. 

Alani Nu is not recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women, children, or individuals taking certain medications. Always check with your doctor if you have specific health concerns or are unsure about consumption.
