## Buyer's Guide

Microsoft Surface Laptop chargers are crucial components for keeping your device powered and performing optimally. This guide outlines key features and considerations to help you choose the right charger for your Surface Laptop. 


### Power Output Specifications

Surface Laptop chargers supply power via USB-C ports. The standard charger outputs 65W, which is sufficient for most daily use scenarios. If you frequently use graphics-intensive applications or external displays, a 96W charger may be more appropriate to avoid frequent charging interruptions. 


### Charger Compatibility

Ensure the charger you select matches your Surface Laptop's model and port configuration. Microsoft Surface laptops typically use a 2-Port USB-C dock, so verify the charger's compatibility with this setup. Avoid using third-party chargers unless they are explicitly certified by Microsoft for Surface devices. 


### Additional Features

Look for chargers with additional safety features like overvoltage protection and short-circuit protection. Some chargers include LED indicators to show charging status, which can be helpful for monitoring battery levels. 


### Physical Design and Build Quality

Invest in a charger with a robust build quality to ensure reliable power delivery. The charger housing should resist deformation under stress. Consider the charging cable's flexibility and durability, as these factors affect both performance and longevity. 


## FAQ


### What types of Microsoft Surface Laptop chargers are available?

Microsoft offers two primary types of Surface Laptop chargers: the Surface Laptop 4 and 5 chargers, which provide 65W of power, and the Surface Laptop 3 charger, which supplies 96W of power. These chargers are specifically designed for their respective models and include a USB-C port for charging the laptop. 

Each charger comes with a power brick that meets energy efficiency standards and is durable enough for daily use. The charger cables are also certified to handle the power requirements of the Surface Laptop while maintaining safety standards. 


### What features do the Surface Laptop chargers have?

The 96W charger includes a USB-C pass-through port, allowing you to charge your Surface Laptop while using a USB-C accessory. Both the 65W and 96W chargers feature LED indicators that show the charging status: green for charged, orange for charging, and red for error. 

Each charger is backed by Microsoft's 18-month warranty and comes with a wall-mounter for convenient storage or desk placement. The chargers are compatible with both desktop and laptop computers, as well as travel situations. 


### How long does it take to charge a Microsoft Surface Laptop?

The charging time varies depending on the laptop model and its battery percentage. However, with the 65W charger, you can expect about 1 hour of use per 20 minutes of charging. The 96W charger can provide similar usage time per charging period. 

For a fully depleted battery, the 65W charger typically takes 2-3 hours to reach 100% charge, while the 96W charger can achieve the same in about 1.5-2.5 hours. 


### Can I use a different charger with my Surface Laptop?

Microsoft recommends using the original charger for optimal performance and battery health. Using a different charger can affect charging speed and potentially damage your laptop's battery. 

If you need to use a different charger temporarily, ensure it provides at least 65W of power for Surface Laptop 4 and 5, and at least 96W for Surface Laptop 3. The charger should also have USB-C input and output ports. 


### How should I care for my Microsoft Surface Laptop charger?

Store the charger in a dry environment away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures. Avoid bending or kinking the power cord, and keep the power brick upright when not in use. 

Check the charging port regularly for dust accumulation and clean it using compressed air or a soft brush if necessary. Avoid using liquids or harsh chemicals to clean the charger, as this can damage its electronic components. 


### How long does a Microsoft Surface Laptop charger last?

The charger's expected lifespan is typically around 3-5 years with normal use. Signs that indicate a charger may need replacement include flickering lights, increased charging times, or difficulty charging the laptop. 

If you notice these issues, or if the charger is physically damaged, it's recommended to replace it. Microsoft offers replacement chargers through their official website or authorized dealers.
