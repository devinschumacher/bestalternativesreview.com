## Buyer's Guide

Wall-mount keyboard trays offer a sleek solution for maintaining ergonomics while freeing up desk space. These versatile stands keep your workspace organized and your back comfortable by keeping your keyboard at a properly elevated and positioned height. 


### Supported Weight and Size Compatibility

Consider the weight capacity of the mount to ensure it can support your specific keyboard and any accessories you plan to use. Most wall mounts can handle between 10-25 pounds, though heavier models are available. Measure your keyboard and mouse together to determine the maximum width and depth the mount should accommodate.

### Installation Requirements and Wall Types

Check if the wall mount requires surface mounting or drilled hole installation. Determine your wall type (drywall, brick, concrete) to choose the appropriate mounting hardware. Some mounts include universal wall anchors for versatility. 


### Adjustability and Configuration Options

Look for mounting systems that offer height, tilt, and sometimes rotation adjustments. Evaluate if the mount supports single or dual keyboards, and if it includes cable management features to keep your cords organized.

### Mounting Options and Aesthetic Considerations

Choose between standard L-shaped or corner mount options depending on your desk layout. Consider the profile of the mount - some designs are more discreet than others. The mount's color and finish should complement your existing furniture while providing adequate visibility for cable connections. 


## FAQ

![Wall-Mount-Keyboard-Trays-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Wall-Mount-Keyboard-Trays-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Why use a wall-mounted keyboard tray?

A wall-mounted keyboard tray helps maintain proper posture by keeping your hands at a natural height while typing. The vertical setup reduces wrist strain and prevents shoulders from hunching forward. 

These trays also save desk space and improve cable management, as they store wires behind the wall. They're particularly useful for small offices or home offices with limited space. 


### What materials are these trays typically made of?

Common materials include steel, aluminum, and plastic-coated metal. Steel offers the most durability but can be heavy, while aluminum provides a lighter alternative. Plastic-coated metal combines strength with reduced weight. 

The surface material usually matches these, with options like powder-coated finishes for steel or UV-resistant plastic coatings. The back panel often uses a different material, like MDF or particle board, for mounting. 

![Wall-Mount-Keyboard-Trays-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Wall-Mount-Keyboard-Trays-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do you install a wall-mounted keyboard tray?

Most models require basic tools like a drill and level. You mark the wall with the provided template, drill pilot holes, and then secure the mounting plate using screws. 

Installation typically takes 15-30 minutes, though some models with complex mounting systems may take longer. The entire process requires a level, drill, and possibly a stud finder. 


### What size considerations are important?

Standard keyboards need trays measuring at least 24 inches wide, while extended keyboards require 30 inches. Taller users may need trays 3 inches deeper than standard keyboards. 

The height adjustment range usually between 18-24 inches, allowing you to position the tray between 26-30 inches from the seat. Monitor mounts often need at least 6 inches of clearance from the tray. 

![Wall-Mount-Keyboard-Trays-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Wall-Mount-Keyboard-Trays-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Are wall-mounted trays compatible with all computers?

Most modern computers and laptops are compatible, though older models or those with unique designs might require additional adapters or mounting solutions. 

The key factors are USB ports for power and data, and a display size that allows proper positioning of both monitor and keyboard. Touchpads typically work fine, though some users prefer external mice. 


### What maintenance do these trays require?

Regular cleaning involves wiping the surface weekly with a damp cloth and mild soap, followed by drying thoroughly to prevent water spots. The mounting hardware should be checked bi-annually for tightness. 

For electronic components like USB ports, keep them free of dust and debris. Some models have special instructions for cleaning monitor mounts or adjusting height mechanisms.
