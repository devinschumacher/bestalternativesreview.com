### Size and Space Considerations

Measure your available space before selecting an ottoman's dimensions. Standard sizes range from 18 to 24 inches tall and 20 to 40 inches wide. Keep in mind that larger ottomans provide more storage capacity but consume more floor space when not in use.

Match the ottoman's finish, color, and style elements to your existing furniture and room decor. Consider the scale of your other pieces when selecting an ottoman size and shape. For a cohesive look, choose an ottoman that complements your room's existing furniture rather than standing out as a statement piece.
