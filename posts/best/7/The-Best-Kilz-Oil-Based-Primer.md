## Buyer's Guide

Kilz oil-based primer is a popular choice for achieving proper paint adhesion and enhancing the durability of your painting project. Understanding its key features and proper application techniques will help you achieve professional-looking results. 


### Key Features of Kilz Oil-Based Primer

Oil-based primers like Kilz provide excellent coverage and adhesion, making them ideal for preparing surfaces before painting. Their long drying time and slower evaporation rate allow for better penetration into the substrate, sealing pores and leveling texture. This type of primer also offers good alkali resistance and hides minor imperfections in the surface. 


### Surface Preparation

Before applying Kilz primer, thoroughly clean the surface to remove dirt, dust, and contaminants. For new or primed surfaces, sand lightly to ensure the primer adheres properly. For old paint or finishes, use a wire brush or sandpaper to remove loose material and provide a textured surface. Always clean the area with a degreaser to remove any oils or wax buildup. 


### Application and Coverage

Kilz oil-based primer typically requires two coats for best results, with adequate drying time between applications. To apply, use a brush, roller, or spray for even coating. Apply the first coat, allowing it to dry according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually 4-6 hours. When dry, lightly sand any rough spots and apply the second coat, following the same drying procedure. 


### Cleanup and Storage

Use water-based cleaners for tools and supplies that came into contact with the primer. Clean up immediately after use to prevent the oil-based primer from drying on equipment. Store the remaining primer in its original container, away from heat and direct sunlight. Keep the lid tightly sealed when not in use to maintain its performance qualities.

The oil-based formula penetrates deeply into the substrate, creating a strong bond between the primer and the surface being painted. This results in a durable basecoat that helps prevent paint failure and improves the longevity of your paint job. 


### What Surfaces Can Kilz Oil-Based Primer Be Used On?

This primer is versatile and can be applied to a wide range of surfaces, including concrete, metal, wood, drywall, and masonry. It works particularly well on porous materials and provides superior adhesion to surfaces that may not bond as readily with water-based products. 

However, it's not recommended for use on freshly painted surfaces, as the oil-based primer can interfere with the adhesion of subsequent coats of paint. Always allow adequate time for new paint to cure before applying primer. 


### How Many Coats Are Needed?

Typically, one coat of Kilz oil-based primer is sufficient for most surfaces. For optimal performance, especially on porous or absorptive substrates, a second coat may be applied after the first coat has dried completely. 

Always follow the manufacturer's instructions on the specific product you're using, as application requirements may vary slightly between different formulations. 


### What Type of Paint Should I Use After Priming?

A oil-based primer should be followed with oil-based paint for best results. This ensures compatibility between the primer and finish coat, maintaining the integrity of the paint system. 

If you're planning to use a water-based paint, apply a coat of oil-based primer and then apply a sealer primer specifically designed for bridging between oil- and water-based systems before applying the topcoat. 


### How Long Should I Wait Between Coats?

Allow the primer to dry completely between coats, which typically takes 4-6 hours at room temperature. The exact drying time will depend on factors such as temperature, humidity, and airflow in your environment. Check the manufacturer's recommendations for the specific product you're using. 

Always test the surface with your finger or a paint scrap – if it feels tacky or leaves residue, it's not yet dry enough to apply another coat. 


### What if I Need to Sand the Surface First?

Before applying primer, ensure the surface is clean, dry, and free of contaminants. For concrete or raw wood, light sanding or wire brushing may be necessary to remove dust and debris. Apply primer to a smooth surface that's free from loose particles. 

For metal surfaces, remove any rust or oxidation using a wire brush or rust remover. Sand the area until it's clean and free of loose material, then apply the primer. Rust inhibitor primer may be necessary on heavily rusted surfaces.
