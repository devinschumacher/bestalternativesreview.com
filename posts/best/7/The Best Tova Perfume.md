Base notes form the final layer of scent, lasting several hours and giving the perfume its distinctive character. 


### Perfume Concentrations

Understanding perfume concentrations can help you select a product that matches your lifestyle and application preferences. Parfum or Eau de Parfum typically contains 15-20% fragrance oils and provides the strongest lasting scent, suitable for daily wear. Eau de Toilette contains 8-12% fragrance oils, offering a balanced concentration that lasts 3-4 hours. Eau de Cologne usually has 3-8% fragrance oils and is best for layering or daytime use. 


### Application and Care

Proper application technique can significantly impact how a fragrance performs. Apply perfume to pulse points like the wrists, neck, and behind the ears where the skin's natural warmth helps the fragrance develop. Avoid applying near the hairline, as heat from the scalp can alter the scent profile. To extend longevity, avoid applying perfume directly to clothing and allow each application to dry before layering additional scents. 


### Personal Consideration

Choosing a Tova fragrance involves considering your personal preferences, lifestyle, and intended wear occasion. Consider whether you prefer fresh, woody, floral, or oriental fragrance profiles. Think about how the fragrance will complement your skin tone and any existing skincare routine. Testing the perfume on your skin and wearing it for several hours can help determine if it suits your taste and lifestyle. 


## FAQ

Tova's fragrances showcase a harmonious blend of oriental, woody, and florals. Each collection captures distinct scent profiles that evolve from top, middle, to base notes, creating a rich olfactory experience. 

The base notes often include warm tonalities of sandalwood and vanilla, while the top notes might feature crisp bergamot or spicy cardamom. Middle notes typically feature a range of floral elements, from delicate jasmine to sensual rose, suspended between these opposing extremes. 


### How does Tova's scent range cater to different occasions?

The brand's diverse collection allows for versatile use across various occasions. Modern classics like "Ethereal" offer timeless appeal for daily wear, while "Intrigue" and "Seduction" showcase bolder compositions suitable for special events. 

Tova also provides options for personal care products, such as lotions and body oils, that complement their signature fragrances. These additional items help extend the longevity and intensity of the perfume, making them a practical addition to any fragrance collection. 


### What makes Tova's perfumes distinctive in the market?

The brand stands out through its combination of quality ingredients and sophisticated packaging. Each bottle features elegant, travel-friendly designs that protect the fragrance while adding a touch of class to any bathroom collection. 

Tova frequently collaborates with renowned perfumers to develop unique compositions, resulting in scents that blend classic elements with contemporary flair. This approach has earned their fragrances recognition in competitive market segments. 


### How should one properly apply Tova perfume for maximum effect?

To optimize your fragrance, apply Tova perfumes to pulse points like the wrists, neck, and behind the ears. Start with a light mist to catch your scent naturally before adding targeted applications to specific areas. 

Avoid applying perfume directly to clothing, as this can transfer easily and may alter the scent's character. Consider using a perfume roller ball on specific areas for added intensity while keeping your overall scent fresh. 


### What tips can you offer for extending a fragrance's longevity?

Application technique plays a crucial role in how long a perfume lasts. Applying to your pulse points helps because the natural warmth of your skin enhances the scent's longevity. Mist your entire body before applying, allowing a brief moment for the perfume to dry, which helps fix the initial notes more effectively. 

Opt for application in a cooler environment when possible, as heat can cause fragrances to evaporate more quickly. The time of day you apply can also affect longevity - applying in the morning can allow the fragrance to develop throughout the day. 


### How should I store my Tova perfume to maintain its quality?

To preserve your Tova fragrance, keep it in its original bottle away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures. The ideal storage location is a cool, dry spot like a closet or drawer, protected from air exposure. 

Avoid storing fragrance near chemicals or strongly scented products as this can alter the scent's integrity. Regularly checking your perfume's condition by smelling it can help you identify any potential changes in quality.
