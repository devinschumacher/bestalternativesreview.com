## FAQ


### What makes a Ducky Mini Keyboard different from a full-size keyboard?

These compact keyboards maintain all the essential features of a full-size model, including dedicated function keys, navigation keys, and multimedia controls. The miniaturization process optimizes key spacing and layout to ensure comfortable typing and precise control, despite the reduced footprint. 


### How much space do Ducky Mini Keyboards take up?

When placed on a desk, a Ducky Mini Keyboard occupies roughly 30% of the space required for a full-size keyboard. Their compact design makes them ideal for small offices, home desks, or spaces where keyboard real estate is limited. 

These keyboards ship in slim packaging that measures approximately 250mm x 110mm x 30mm, making them easy to store when not in use. Most models include a carrying bag or protective case for safe transportation and protection during travel. 


### What are the main connectivity options for Ducky Mini Keyboards?

The most common connection methods for Ducky Mini Keyboards are USB Type-C and Bluetooth 5.0. USB-C allows for quick charging and data transfer, while Bluetooth provides wireless connectivity with a range of up to 10 meters, enabling use with multiple devices without interference from other USB hubs. 

Some models also include USB-A ports for charging and data transfer, making them versatile options for users who need additional connectivity features in a compact package. 


### How do Ducky Mini Keyboards handle power consumption?

Thanks to their compact design and efficient components, Ducky Mini Keyboards typically consume less power than traditional full-size keyboards. Many models feature energy-efficient processors and optimized circuitry to minimize power usage while maintaining responsive performance. 

Their smaller size also means they produce less heat during operation, allowing for quieter keyboard usage without the need for additional cooling systems. This makes them suitable for use in environments where power consumption and heat generation are concerns. 


### What type of maintenance do Ducky Mini Keyboards require?

Proper maintenance for a Ducky Mini Keyboard includes regular dusting of the surface and ventilation ports to prevent overheating. Users should avoid harsh chemicals and instead use a soft cloth with mild soap and water for cleaning the surface. 

Key maintenance focuses on keeping the keys clean and free from debris. Users can use compressed air to remove dust from between keys and apply approved key cleaning solutions to maintain optimal performance. The built-in LED indicators and USB ports require protection from water and dust to prevent damage. 


### Can Ducky Mini Keyboards handle gaming and-intensive tasks?

While Ducky Mini Keyboards excel in everyday use and typing, their performance for gaming and intensive tasks can vary based on the specific model and use case. Most models feature anti-ghosting technology and 100% mechanical key switches, which are suitable for basic gaming but may not match the response times of dedicated gaming keyboards. 

For gaming and professional use, look for models with dedicated gaming features such as 100% PBT keycaps, anti-ghosting technology above 6 keys, and optimized mechanical switches. These features enhance durability and responsiveness while maintaining the compact design's benefits.
