## Buyer's Guide

A king size weighted blanket combines warmth and pressure therapy in one cozy cover, ideal for improved sleep and relaxation. We'll guide you through key features to consider, helping you find the perfect weighted blanket for your needs. 


### Weight Considerations

Weighted blankets come in various levels, typically ranging from 5 to 30 pounds. King sizes usually fall between 30 and 45 pounds. Newer, smaller versions start around 10 pounds. The right weight should make you feel comfortable and relaxed, but not restrict movement. Factors like your body type, sleep style, and temperature sensitivity influence the ideal weight. 


### Filling Materials

Materials affect both comfort and durability. Glass beads provide a consistent weight distribution and uniform feel but can be heavier. Polyfill and buckwheat hulls offer lighter alternatives while maintaining pressure. Modern alternatives like memory foam chips adapt to your body shape and temperature. Quality filling should resist shifting and clumping over time, maintaining even weight distribution. 


### Construction and Durability

Look for reinforced stitching, especially around corners and weight pockets, to prevent unraveling. The blanket's surface quality matters: soft fabrics like cotton or bamboo blend are most comfortable for daily use. Premium materials often feature multiple layers for increased comfort and thermal regulation. Consider the blanket's ease of care, with options like removable covers and machine-washable materials being practical for daily use. 


### Additional Features

Some blankets include special features like built-in heating pads, cooling patches, or lavender-filled sachets for additional comfort. Consider how these features interact with the blanket's weight and filling. For individuals with specific needs, look for blankets with moisture-wicking properties, waterproof covers, or those designed for pets. 


## FAQ


### What is a weighted blanket?

A weighted blanket is a type of therapeutic blanket that provides deep pressure stimulation, similar to a gentle hug. This sensation can help reduce anxiety, improve sleep quality, and promote relaxation. 

These blankets typically weigh between 10% to 20% of a person's body weight and contain glass or plastic pellets evenly distributed throughout the fabric. 


### What makes a king size weighted blanket different?

A king size weighted blanket offers more coverage and space, with dimensions typically measuring 76 inches by 80 inches (193 cm by 203 cm). 

This larger size is ideal for couples who need separate blankets while sleeping or for individuals who prefer extra coverage, providing the same relaxation benefits across a larger surface area. 


### What are the benefits of a king size weighted blanket?

King size blankets combine the proven therapeutic effects of weighted blankets with generous dimensions, making them suitable for larger sleepers and couples who share a bed. 

The increased surface area helps distribute weight evenly, providing consistent pressure across the body for enhanced relaxation and sleep quality. 


### What should I consider when choosing a king size weighted blanket?

Key factors include the blanket's weight (adjusted to your body weight), filling material (glass or plastic pellets), and temperature regulation features. 

Consider the blanket's durability, ease of cleaning, and any additional features like machine washability or reversible designs to find the right balance of comfort and practicality. 


### How do I wash a king size weighted blanket?

Most king size weighted blankets are machine washable, though you may need to use a larger wash cycle or split the blanket into sections for easier handling. 

Follow the manufacturer's care instructions, typically recommending gentle cycles with air drying to prevent excessive wear on the filling material. 


### Are there any drawbacks to using a king size weighted blanket?

Some people might find the weight too heavy, especially if the blanket's weight exceeds 20% of their body weight. This could be discomforting, particularly for those with limited mobility. 

Additionally, the thickness and weight might not be practical for hot sleepers, as they can make it difficult to regulate body temperature during the night.
