## Buyer's Guide

The Kleenex Cool Touch facial tissue offers a refreshing alternative to traditional tissues during hot weather. These specially designed tissues feature a patented cooling technology that provides a temporary 5-second chill upon contact with your skin. 


### Key Technical Specifications

Each Kleenex Cool Touch tissue contains a proprietary gel pack that remains cold for several hours after initial activation. The tissues are available in standard box packaging containing 200 tissues per pack. 

![Kleenex-Cool-Touch-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Kleenex-Cool-Touch-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Activation and Usage

Simply unfold the tissue and apply it to your skin to activate the cooling mechanism. The gel pack begins to cool the tissue immediately and maintains its temperature for approximately 5 seconds before gradually returning to room temperature. 


### Cooling Effectiveness

The cooling sensation is most effective when used in conjunction with exposure to ambient temperatures. While the tissues may not provide significant relief in extremely hot environments, they can offer a noticeable refreshment in less extreme conditions. 

![Kleenex-Cool-Touch-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Kleenex-Cool-Touch-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Additional Considerations

These tissues are not designed for repeated use and should be discarded after single application. The cooling technology activates during the unfolding process, so it's important to use them promptly after removal from the wrapper. 


## FAQ

![Kleenex-Cool-Touch-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Kleenex-Cool-Touch-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What makes Kleenex Cool Touch different from regular tissues?

Kleenex Cool Touch tissues contain a specialized cooling agent that creates a refreshing sensation when applied to the skin. This helps alleviate discomfort from colds, flu symptoms, and congestion. 

The cooling effect can also help reduce inflammation and soothe irritation, making these tissues particularly soothing for sensitive noses and throats. 


### How do the cooling tissues work?

The tissues contain a patented formula that combines activated carbon with a cooling agent. When pressed against the skin, the moisture from your body activates the cooling component. 

This rapid cooling effect provides immediate relief from nasal congestion and other cold symptoms, offering a more comfortable alternative to traditional tissues. 

![Kleenex-Cool-Touch-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Kleenex-Cool-Touch-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Are these tissues suitable for children?

Yes, Kleenex Cool Touch tissues are safe for children to use under adult supervision. The cooling formula makes them particularly effective for young children who often have more sensitive nasal passages. 

Always ensure children dispose of used tissues properly and wash their hands to prevent the spread of germs. 


### How long does the cooling effect last?

The cooling effect typically lasts for about 30-45 seconds after each use, making multiple applications effective throughout the day. 

For optimal results, keep a package of Kleenex Cool Touch tissues in your vehicle, at your desk, or in your bag to use as needed. 

![Kleenex-Cool-Touch-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Kleenex-Cool-Touch-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can these tissues be used with contact lenses?

Yes, the cooling tissues are safe for use with contact lenses. The moisture released during use helps prevent lens dryness and discomfort during cold and flu season. 

Always clean your contact lenses according to your eye care provider's instructions to maintain optimal eye health. 


### Are these tissues eco-friendly?

The Kleenex Cool Touch tissues are made from 70% recycled fiber, making them a more environmentally friendly option than traditional single-use tissues. 

The compact package design also helps reduce waste, as it contains 20% fewer tissues than standard boxes while providing the same number of sheets.
