## Buyer's Guide

Bellevue candles combine elegance with affordability, making them a popular choice for both homeowners and businesses. Understanding their key features and considerations will help you select the perfect candles for your space. 


### Materials and Construction

Most Bellevue candles are made of soy wax, known for its natural properties and clean burn. The container typically features durable vitreousware or ceramic, providing both aesthetic appeal and long-term value. Opt for products with a secure lid to prevent spillage and contamination. 

![Bellevue-Candles-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Bellevue-Candles-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Burning Requirements

The candles require minimal maintenance, needing to be placed on a stable, heat-resistant surface away from drafts. Allow the initial burn to reach the candle's widest point to establish an even burn path. Regularly trim the wick to ¼ inch to prevent mushrooming and ensure consistent burning. 


### Differentiators

While basic Bellevue candles offer reliable performance, some variations include premium coatings, specialized wick designs, or larger sizes. Consider these features based on your specific needs and usage frequency. Always check the manufacturer's recommendations for optimal performance.
