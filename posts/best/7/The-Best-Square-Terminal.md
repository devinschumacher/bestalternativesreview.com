## Buyer's Guide

A Square terminal transforms your smartphone or tablet into a powerful point-of-sale (POS) system, making it easier than ever to process payments. Here's what you need to consider when choosing the right Square terminal for your business. 


### Payment Processing Features

Look for a terminal that supports credit and debit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and other popular payment methods. Some terminals offer advanced features like EMV chip and PIN support, which are essential for secure card transactions. Consider whether the terminal can process contactless payments and if it can handle both magnetic stripe and chip cards. 


### Mobile Compatibility

The terminal should be compatible with your device's operating system. While iOS and Android support are standard, verify that the terminal works with your specific model and version. Check if the terminal pairs easily with your device and if there are any additional setup requirements. 


### Additional Features and Accessories

Some terminals offer extra features like built-in receipt printers, barcode scanners, or the ability to take photos of receipts. Consider if these features are important for your business. Also, check if the terminal requires a physical dock or if it can be used wirelessly via Bluetooth or cellular data. 


### Cost and Value

Terminal costs vary based on features and compatibility. Factor in setup fees, monthly charges, and potential integration costs with your existing point-of-sale system. Consider the total cost of ownership, including maintenance, software updates, and any additional accessories you might need. 


## FAQ


### What is the Square Terminal?

The Square Terminal is a payment processing device that enables small businesses to accept card payments directly from customers' devices (like phones and tablets). It's compact, magnetic-stripe capable, and works with the Square point-of-sale app. 

The Terminal connects to any iOS or Android device via Bluetooth, allowing you to process payments, manage your business, and stay connected to your online Square account. It's ideal for merchants who want a simple, mobile payment solution without the need for a traditional credit card reader. 


### How does the Square Terminal work?

First, you need to download the Square point-of-sale app and link it to your Square account. The Terminal then pairs with your device using Bluetooth. When a customer presents a card, you swipe the card through the Terminal's magnetic stripe reader, which captures the payment information. 

The app processes the transaction and charges your customer's card. You can also accept card-present EMV chip cards if your device supports NFC payments. The entire process requires no special software or installation, making it accessible for merchants of all skill levels. 


### What are the payment processing fees?

Square charges a 2.6% + 10¢ fee per transaction processed through the Terminal on iOS and Android devices. This fee applies to all payments made, with no minimum transaction amount. 

Unlike some competitors, Square doesn't offer free transaction tiers. However, the company provides a comprehensive suite of business tools that can help offset these fees, including inventory management, employee scheduling, and sales reporting features. 


### What are the technical requirements?

The Square Terminal requires a supported iOS or Android device running the latest operating system version. The device must have Bluetooth 4.0 or later and be at least 32GB. The app also needs a stable internet connection to sync with your Square account. 

For EMV chip card support, your device must have NFC capabilities. The Terminal itself needs a 9-volt battery, which charges from USB and can process up to 800 transactions between charges. The device should be kept powered on to maintain connection to the app. 


### Is the Square Terminal secure?

Square employs multiple layers of security for the Terminal and app, including tokenization of payment data and encryption of all communication between the device and Square servers. The company conducts regular security audits to maintain industry-leading protection standards. 

However, as with any payment processing solution, it's important to keep the device secure and protect your Square account login information. The app requires multi-factor authentication, and Square encourages users to enable additional security features like app-specific passwords. 


### Can I use the Square Terminal internationally?

Square supports international payments through the Terminal, but the merchant account must be set up for multi-currency processing. Transactions are converted to the merchant's primary currency, with currency conversion fees applied. 

The app allows you to switch between different merchant accounts and currencies, making it suitable for businesses operating in multiple countries. However, not all payment networks support international transactions, so you may face limitations depending on your specific location and credit card types.
