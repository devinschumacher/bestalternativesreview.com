## Buyer's Guide

Lilac essential oil combines the delicate floral notes of lilac with therapeutic properties that can benefit both mind and body. When selecting a lilac essential oil, consider factors such as purity, concentration, and intended use to ensure you choose the right product for your needs.

### Concentration

Lilac essential oil typically comes in two forms: diluted in a carrier oil or in pure form. The concentration affects both effectiveness and application method. Higher concentrations can provide stronger therapeutic benefits but require proper dilution for external use. 


### Intended Use

Consider how you plan to use the essential oil. For aromatherapy, pure or diluted drops in a diffuser can create a relaxing atmosphere. For topical application, dilution is essential to avoid skin irritation. Always perform a patch test before widespread use.
