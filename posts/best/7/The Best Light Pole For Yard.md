## Buyer's Guide

Light poles transform outdoor spaces by illuminating pathways, highlighting features, and enhancing security. When selecting a pole, consider these key factors to find the right balance of functionality and aesthetics. 


### Light Output and Wattage

Calculate your lighting needs based on the pole's intended use and the area to be illuminated. Consider the lumen output, which determines brightness. For residential use, poles typically range from 100-200 lumens per foot of height.

### Mounting Options and Pole Height

Evaluate different mounting options like wall-mounted, post-mounted, or underground. Decide on the ideal height based on your space, with general guidelines being 10-20 feet for residential and 20-30 feet for commercial applications. 


### Material Durability and Maintenance

Common materials include aluminum, stainless steel, and weather-resistant PVC. Consider factors like corrosion resistance, weight capacity, and ease of maintenance. Higher-quality materials often provide longer-lasting performance and reduced maintenance costs.

## FAQ

![Light-Pole-For-Yard-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Light-Pole-For-Yard-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is the difference between a light pole and a regular yard light?

A light pole is specifically designed to support outdoor lighting fixtures in residential or commercial landscapes. Unlike regular yard lights, which are typically small, standalone fixtures, light poles provide a higher mounting point for illumination, often reaching heights of 10-20 feet. This elevated position allows for better coverage of large areas and improved visibility. 

Light poles are engineered to handle the weight of various lighting options and are installed with proper structural supports to ensure stability in different weather conditions. They usually come with adjustable mounting points for multiple fixtures or flexible arm extensions, allowing you to direct light where it's needed most. 


### How do I choose the right height for my light pole?

The ideal height for a light pole depends on your specific needs and the surrounding environment. Consider the height of your trees, shrubs, and buildings to ensure the light pole doesn't block neighboring properties' views. A general rule of thumb is to install the light pole at least 6 feet above the ground to provide adequate clearance for pedestrians and vehicles. 

Elevations between 10-15 feet are commonly recommended for residential yards, as they offer good coverage while minimizing glare. Commercial applications may require taller poles (15-20 feet) for broader illumination of parking lots, sidewalks, or building facades.

### What materials are commonly used in light pole construction?

The most common materials for light poles are aluminum and steel, chosen for their durability and resistance to corrosion. Aluminum poles are lightweight, making them easier to install, and available in various colors through anodizing. Steel poles, often coated with a protective finish like PVC or powder coating, offer greater strength and are available in black or natural steel tones. 

Other materials include concrete for shorter, decorative poles, and galvanized steel for agricultural applications. Consider the local climate and intended use when selecting a material, as aluminum performs best in coastal environments, while steel is more suitable for industrial or rural settings. 


### How should I maintain my light pole to ensure it lasts?

Regular maintenance is crucial for the longevity of your light pole. Check the bolts and mounting points quarterly to ensure they're tight and properly secured. Apply a fresh coat of paint or protective coating to exposed metal surfaces as needed to prevent corrosion. 

Inspect the pole for signs of damage, such as cracks, dents, or loose pieces, especially after severe weather events. Replace any cracked paint or missing components promptly. For aluminum poles, consider applying a corrosion inhibitor to prevent oxidation over time.

### What are the main types of fixtures that can be mounted on light poles?

Light poles support a variety of fixtures, including floodlights, spotlights, and fixtures with adjustable arms. Floodlights provide wide-area illumination and are ideal for large yards or open spaces. Spotlights offer focused light in specific directions and are useful for highlighting architectural features or pathways. 

Many poles also accommodate bollard-style fixtures, which sit horizontally on the pole and are used for accent lighting or decorative purposes. Some poles feature adjustable arms that allow you to direct the light in multiple directions, while others support a single fixture with a built-in mounting bracket. 


### How do I properly install a light pole?

Installing a light pole requires careful planning and proper equipment. Begin by marking the pole's location and excavating a hole that's slightly deeper than the pole's length. Line the hole with concrete, ensuring it's level and secure. Place the pole in the hole and fill it with concrete, allowing it to cure according to the manufacturer's instructions. 

For taller poles, consider using a concrete underpinning system or a trench foot base for added stability. Always install on a flat, solid surface and leave enough space between the concrete and the pole's base to allow for expansion. If mounting multiple fixtures, ensure the pole's weight distribution allows for proper support.
