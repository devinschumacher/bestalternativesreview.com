### Performance Considerations

Measure your vehicle's curb weight and intended usage (e. g. , light duty, hauling, off-roading) to determine suitable load-carrying capacity. Consider your driving environment - heavier snowfall areas require different specifications than coastal regions. Proper inflation is crucial; refer to your vehicle's manual for the correct tire pressure for all conditions. 


### Tire Specification Basics

The tire size (e. g. , P235/75R16) indicates width, aspect ratio, construction type, and rim diameter. The load index reflects maximum supported weight per tire. Temperature ratings (A, B, C) measure the tire's resistance to heat buildup during operation. Always consult your vehicle's owner manual for recommended tire specifications.

### Maintenance and Storage

Check tire pressure monthly and before trips, especially when storage conditions change. Store tires in a dry, cool place away from direct sunlight if not in use. When switching between sets, check for uneven wear patterns that might indicate improper rotation or installation. For best results, rotate tires every 6,000 to 8,000 miles, or according to the vehicle manufacturer's recommendations.

Falken's all-terrain tires are engineered for both on-road and off-road versatility, with features like open shoulder designs and deep grooves for mud and snow traction. All-season tires, in contrast, prioritize year-round performance on dry and wet paved surfaces.
