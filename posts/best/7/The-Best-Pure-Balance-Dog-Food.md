## Buyer's Guide

Pure Balance dog food stands out in the market due to its focus on whole ingredients and nutritional balance. Understanding the key aspects of their diet can help you choose the right formula for your pet. 


### Nutritional Profiles

Pure Balance offers several formulas, each designed to meet specific nutritional needs. Their Chicken and Brown Rice Formula focuses on balanced macronutrients, while the Turkey and Potato Formula emphasizes hypoallergenic properties. Consider your dog's age, activity level, and health status to determine the most suitable profile. 


### Ingredient Quality

The quality of ingredients directly impacts your dog's health. Pure Balance uses real meat as the first ingredient in most formulas, which is preferable to meat meal or by-products. Their recipes also limit artificial preservatives and additives, making them a good choice for dogs with sensitive stomachs. 


### Protein Sources

Protein is crucial for dog health, and Pure Balance prioritizes high-quality protein sources like chicken, turkey, and salmon. Look for recipes with a higher percentage of protein compared to fillers like rice or potatoes. This ensures your pet receives adequate nourishment for muscle development and overall health. 


### Bolusing Nutritional Balance

The company's recipes account for appropriate ratios of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. While grains provide energy, they shouldn't dominate the formula. Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are especially important for skin health and coat quality, so verify these are included in the correct balance.
