## Buyer's Guide

Orchid bark is a popular growing medium for orchids due to its excellent drainage properties and ability to retain just the right amount of moisture. Understanding the unique requirements of orchids helps in selecting the most suitable bark type and size for your plants. 


### Drainage and Moisture Retention

Orchid bark's primary function is to provide adequate drainage while maintaining moisture levels. Look for bark that has been processed to create various particle sizes, as different orchid species have different moisture and drainage needs. Fine bark suits miniature orchids and epiphytes, while coarse bark is more suitable for larger plants with thicker roots. 

![Orchid-Bark-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Orchid-Bark-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Organic Content and pH Levels

Quality orchid bark is typically made from aged pine or fir wood, which has natural beneficial properties for orchids. Organic content improves air circulation around the roots and provides essential nutrients. The pH level of the bark affects your orchid's nutrient uptake, with most orchids preferring a slightly acidic environment between 5.5 and 6.5. 


### Preparation and Reconditioning

Before using fresh orchid bark, it's important to sterilize it to prevent the spread of pests and pathogens. This can be done by soaking the bark in a solution of one part bleach to nine parts water for 30 minutes, then rinsing thoroughly. Once used, dormant bark can be refreshed by soaking and rinsing it, but active root systems may need a complete replacement every 1-2 years. 

![Orchid-Bark-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Orchid-Bark-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Selecting the Right Bark Size

The correct bark size depends on the maturity of your orchid and its specific needs. Generally, younger plants benefit from finer bark ( < 1/8 inch) to allow for better root development, while mature plants can handle larger particles (1/4 to 1/2 inch). Monitor your plant's health and adjust the bark size as needed to optimize its growth conditions. 


## FAQ

![Orchid-Bark-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Orchid-Bark-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is orchid bark, and why is it important?

Orchid bark is a natural medium made from processed bark, typically Quercus robur ( English oak), specifically designed for orchid cultivation. It provides an ideal environment for orchid roots to grow and help prevent overwatering while allowing proper drainage. 

Its properties include excellent water retention, a neutral pH, and a lack of nutrients, which helps prevent root rot and encourages strong root growth. The bark's structure also provides air pockets that promote root respiration. 


### What are the different types of orchid bark available?

Common types include fine-grade (1/8" - 1/4") for mounting plants or small pots, medium-grade (1/4" - 1/2") for general potting, and coarse-grade (1/2" - 1") for larger containers or as a base layer. Some mixes also include sphagnum moss for additional moisture retention. 

Specialized grades are available for specific orchid types: Corky-ribbed bark provides better moisture control for epiphytic species, while Pleurothallis-grade bark has a finer texture suitable for terrestrial species. 

![Orchid-Bark-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Orchid-Bark-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How should orchid bark be prepared before use?

Before use, soak the bark in water for at least 24 hours to remove dust and debris. This prevents contaminated particles from introducing disease to your plants. Rinse to remove any excess water and allow it to thoroughly dry before potting. 

For outdoor cultivation, place the bark in the sun for several days to dry completely and kill any potential pests or diseases. This helps prevent them from affecting your plants during transplanting. 


### How is orchid bark different from other potting mediums?

Unlike traditional potting soils, orchid bark lacks nutrients and maintains a drier environment, which is crucial for epiphytic orchids that naturally grow on trees where they receive minimal soil nutrients. It typically contains 20-30% organic material compared to conventional potting mixes, which can be up to 70% organic matter. 

The physical properties of orchid bark, including its size range and porous nature, create an ideal environment for aerobic root growth. Nutrient-rich potting soils can encourage root growth too closely to the surface, where they are more susceptible to rotting. 

![Orchid-Bark-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Orchid-Bark-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can orchid bark be reused?

Yes, orchid bark can be reused, but it needs to be refreshed regularly. After removing any remaining plant material and thoroughly rinsing, the bark can be reused in the same pot or combined with fresh bark. It typically needs replacing every 1-2 years to maintain optimal conditions. 

However, if the bark appears overly worn, smells musty, or has visible debris, it should be discarded to prevent introducing pathogens to the plants. Fresh bark should be added to top-dress the pot or mix with the old material. 


### Where can I buy orchid bark?

Orchid bark is available online through specialized gardening retailers and in-store at nurseries and garden centers that carry orchid supplies. It's also found in the orchid section of larger garden centers or through local orchid societies. 

Some options for online purchase include websites dedicated to orchid supplies, hydroponic stores, and specialized garden centers with an extensive selection of orchid-growing materials.
