## FAQ


### What is the capacity of the Callaway Org 14 cart bag?

The Callaway Org 14 cart bag features a spacious design with 14.5 liters of storage capacity. This ample space can accommodate up to 14 standard golf clubs, plus additional accessories and clothing for your round. 

The bag's design prioritizes organization and accessibility, with separate pockets for balls, snacks, and personal items while maintaining enough room for your golf clubs. 


### How is the Callaway Org 14 cart bag organized?

The bag includes a dual-action side entry with one large main compartment and one expandable chest pocket. The main compartment holds up to 14 clubs, with the chest pocket providing extra space for practice balls, towels, or personal items. 

Below the main compartment, there's a lower storage area featuring additional pockets for balls, gloves, and personal gear, ensuring all your essentials are within easy reach. 


### Rigid vs. Non-Rigid Frame: What's the Difference?

A rigid frame provides better stability and protection for your clubs during transport, with less flexing and potential damage. Most cart bags on the market today use rigid frames for this reason. 

Non-rigid bags are generally lighter and more flexible, which can be advantageous for storage or carrying when not in use. However, they offer slightly less protection for your clubs during transport. 


### What are the dimensions of the Callaway Org 14 cart bag?

The bag measures approximately 26 inches in length, 14 inches in height, and 9 inches in width at its widest point. These dimensions strike a balance between portability and storage capacity. 

The compact footprint makes the bag easy to store in your garage or car when not in use, while the generous height allows for comfortable access to your clubs without bending. 


### How does the Org 14 compare to Callaway's other cart bags?

The Org 14 represents the upper tier of Callaway's cart bag lineup, offering more features and slightly better organization than their mid-tier models like the Org 12. It falls just below the premium Org 14 V2 in terms of technology and functionality. 

Users who value the bag's specific features, such as the dual-action entry or extra storage pockets, will find it superior to the Org 12 but slightly less advanced than the latest Org 14 V2 model. 


### Are the materials water-resistant?

The bag's exterior features a water-resistant coating to protect your equipment and personal items from light rain or dew. While it's not fully waterproof, it effectively prevents water damage in typical golfing conditions. 

The bottom panel and base of the bag incorporate extra protection with a reinforced, non-water-absorbent construction to prevent pooling or direct water damage during use.
