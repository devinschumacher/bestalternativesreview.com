These products come in numerous forms, each designed to stimulate different senses while providing a tactile outlet for restlessness or anxiety. When selecting the right fidget toy, consider factors such as the type of sensory input it provides, its portability, durability, and whether it requires assembly or power.

Sensory fidget toys engage various senses including touch, pressure, and movement. Textured materials, weighted components, and motorized features all stimulate the nervous system differently. Consider which type of sensory input you prefer or find most effective for your needs.
