The system requires an internet connection and the HP Smart app, which provides tools for organizing and printing documents from various sources. 

Printers with HP Smart can also act as a hub for other HP devices in the same network, sharing files and printing capabilities. This functionality requires an active internet connection and may incur data usage charges for some features. 


### What media sizes are supported by the HP Deskjet 2755e?

The printer supports standard paper sizes up to A4, with automatic document feeder handling originals up to 5.5 x 8.5 inches. It can print on various media types including photo paper, standard paper, and select cardstock. The print capacity is estimated at 6,000 pages with normal use.

### Are there any additional costs associated with using the HP Deskjet 2755e?

In addition to ink costs, users may incur data usage charges for certain HP Smart features that require internet access. Monthly subscription fees may apply for document storage or cloud printing services through the HP Smart ecosystem. 

The printer's built-in router function draws power continuously, which increases electricity usage and costs compared to traditional wired printers. However, the device eliminates the need for separate networking equipment, potentially offsetting some power consumption benefits.
