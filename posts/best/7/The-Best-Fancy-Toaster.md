## Buyer's Guide

Fancy toasters combine basic toaster functionality with additional features for enhanced convenience and improved toast quality. Understanding the key components and options will help you select a toaster that matches your needs and style preferences. 


### Number of Slots

Choose between single, dual, or multi-slot toasters based on your household size and meal preferences. Single-slot toasters are ideal for individuals or smaller families, while dual-slot models accommodate two slices simultaneously, perfect for breakfast preparation. Multi-slot toasters offer flexibility for various baking needs but require more countertop space. 


### Toasting Features

Modern fancy toasters feature adjustable temperature controls for precise browning, preset toast settings for common preferences, and defrost modes for frozen items. Some models include dark, medium, and light settings, while others offer single-degree control for professional-grade customization. Consider how versatile these features are for your cooking habits. 


### Browning Control and Evenness

Even heating and consistent browning come from proper toaster design. Look for broad heating elements that cover the entire slice width, adjustable slots, and parallel slot alignment to prevent skewing. Digital browning controls with pre-programmed settings often provide the best combination of accuracy and ease of use. 


### Additional Convenience Features

Modern toasters frequently include bagel modes, extra-wide slots for oversized breads, and quick-heat settings for reheating leftovers. Some models feature easy-clean interiors, removable crumb trays, or quiet operation for late-night use. Consider which features enhance daily usage without compromising countertop space or cleaning requirements. 


## FAQ


### Which fancy toaster has the most even toasting?

While many fancy toasters excel at even toasting, the Breville BFD680XL stands out. Its True Toast technology uses six vertical heating elements and precise temperature control to produce consistently golden-brown slices. 

For those seeking a highly-rated alternative, the Popart PF5000XL offers similar performance with its eight heating elements and toast-level indicator lights, making it easier to achieve perfectly toasted bread. 


### What features should I look for in a fancy toaster?

A good fancy toaster should include adjustable browning controls, easy-to-clean crumb trays, and multiple slot options for various bread sizes. Look for models with non-slip feet and ergonomic handles for convenience during use. 

Advanced features might include pop-up toast indicators, reheat function, and defrost settings. Consider the width of the slots and whether the toaster has adjustable height for different bread types. 


### How do I clean a fancy toaster?

Most fancy toasters have removable crumb trays that can be emptied and washed regularly to prevent odor buildup. The interior toaster walls can usually be cleaned with a soft cloth or sponge while the appliance is cool. 

Avoid using abrasive cleaners or steel wool, as these can scratch the interior surfaces. Some models feature self-cleaning functions, but always ensure the toaster is completely cool before attempting any cleaning. 


### What is the best fancy toaster for French toast?

The Black & Decker 12 Slice French Toast Maker is specifically designed for thick slices of bread and includes heating bands dedicated to French toast, ensuring consistent results for this popular breakfast dish. 

For those who prefer a vertical toaster, the Breville BFD680XL's extra-wide slots and six heating elements work well for thick bread, including Canadian bacon and eggs on the side. 


### How long do fancy toasters last?

With proper care, a quality fancy toaster can last 8-10 years. The lifespan often depends on usage frequency and maintenance - keeping the crumb tray clean and ensuring the appliance is unplugged when not in use can significantly extend its life. 

Regularly inspect the heating elements and interior surfaces for wear, and replace the appliance if you notice uneven toasting or unusual smells. Most manufacturers offer 1-2 year warranties on their toasters, which can cover defects during this period. 


### Can I use different types of bread in a fancy toaster?

Most fancy toasters perform well with standard bread, bagels, and English muffins. Their adjustable slots and heating elements typically accommodate slices ranging from 1/2 inch to 2 inches thick. 

For thicker bread or items like baguettes, adjust the toaster settings to a lower level to prevent burning. Some models, like the Black & Decker 12 Slice, have dedicated slots for specific bread types, making them ideal for versatility.
