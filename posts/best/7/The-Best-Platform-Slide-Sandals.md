These platform slide sandals are all about that perfect balance of height and comfort. The beige hue pairs beautifully with the metal buckles and stud details, making them a versatile addition to any casual outfit. The elevated 2-inch wedge heel gives the faux-heel look without the stand-out height, so you can walk around in style all day long. 


### [Steve Madden Kali Suede Platform Slide](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Platform+Slide+Sandals?utm\_term=steve-madden-kali-suede-platform-slide)

These Steve Madden platform slide sandals combine bold buckled straps with a 2.5-inch heel for a striking look. The suede upper and chunky platform make them a conversation starter, though some find the weight challenging. Adjustable straps and multiple top buckles offer customization, but the heavy sole requires careful walking. While some love the stylish detail, others struggle with comfort, particularly around the ankle strap. 


### [Women's Pillars Platform Slide Sandal](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Platform+Slide+Sandals?utm\_term=womens-pillars-platform-slide-sandal)

![Women's Pillars Platform Slide Sandal | Image](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcShOsl8fnLxXkb9eMMQNQ8X1aRQT-z4BE1nz7E821JVXRAdba\_MG4Sh27vsusPFhBZwld5RUnQku9twsv79jyLIymDn9ymK&usqp=CAY)

Crocheted fabric pillars add height and texture to these women's slide sandals, though the 2.5-inch platform can be a bit heavy on the feet. While the jute-wrapped midsole and padded footbed aim to provide some comfort, many reviewers noted painful blisters and difficultly walking in them for extended periods. The open-toe design and crisscross straps look great, but the shoes tend to be too loose and lack proper support for daily wear.

The Dayspring sandals by Sorel combine comfortable height with versatile style, though sizing can be inconsistent.
