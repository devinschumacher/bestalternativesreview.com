## Buyer's Guide

Wave grease is a specialized type of lubricant designed for maritime applications. It's crucial to choose a wave grease that can perform reliably in salty, humid environments while maintaining its properties under load. This guide outlines key considerations for selecting the right wave grease for your marine equipment. 


### Water-Resistant Properties

Wave greases contain additives that prevent water penetration and maintain lubrication even when immersed. Look for products with a water-resistant rating that matches your operating conditions.
