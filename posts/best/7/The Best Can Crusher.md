## Buyer's Guide

Can crushers reduce the size of aluminum and steel cans for easier storage and recycling. They're ideal for households, camping trips, and anywhere you need to save space for empty cans. Understanding their features will help you choose the right one for your needs. 


### Capacity and Size

Crushers range from small countertop models to large floor-standing units. Consider how many cans you typically need to dispose of, as this will determine the required capacity. For most households, a 100-can capacity is sufficient. Portable models are convenient for picnics and outdoor events. 

![Can-Crusher-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Can-Crusher-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Design and Portability

Some crushers feature wheels or stands for easier mobility. Wall-mounted models save counter space but require fixed installation. Portable options often include carrying handles, while wall mounts need drilling for installation. 


### Operational Features

Manual crushers use simple levers or handles to compress cans, while electric versions can crush multiple cans at once with a push of a button. Safety features like automatic shut-off prevent accidents, while progressive resistance helps prevent hand injury. 

![Can-Crusher-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Can-Crusher-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Maintenance and Durability

Crushers requiring regular maintenance (like emptying waste bins) may need more frequent cleaning. Materials affect durability; aluminum frames are lighter but more prone to dents, while stainless steel provides lasting performance but at a higher cost. 


## FAQ

![Can-Crusher-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Can-Crusher-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a can crusher?

A can crusher is a device that reduces aluminum and other types of cans to a smaller size, making them easier to store and transport for recycling or disposal. 

These machines efficiently compact cans using a powerful hydraulic mechanism or motor-driven rollers, significantly reducing their volume while maintaining the integrity of the metallic material. 


### How does a can crusher work?

Most can crushers feature a hinged mechanism that clamps down on a can placed inside. When activated, this closes the jaws around the can, applying force to compress it. 

For hydraulic models, there's often a crank or lever that increases pressure for more aggressive crushing. Motorized versions rely on electricity to drive the compression rollers. 

![Can-Crusher-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Can-Crusher-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What types of cans can be crushed?

These devices typically handle standard aluminum cans, including 12-ounce and 16-ounce sizes. Some models are also capable of crushing steel cans and aerosol containers. 

While popular for aluminum drinks and food cans, note that some can crushers may have limitations with specialty can sizes or shapes. 


### Are can crushers safe to use?

Can crushers are generally safe when used properly. Always ensure the can is properly positioned and the machine is stable before activating. 

Avoid crushing cans that are dented, rusted, or contain residue. For optimal safety, never place fingers near the crushing mechanism when operating. 

![Can-Crusher-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Can-Crusher-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What maintenance is required for a can crusher?

Regular maintenance includes checking the mechanism for proper alignment and lubricating moving parts as needed to prevent wear. 

After each use, clean the mechanism to remove debris and check for signs of damage that might affect future performance. 


### How much space do I need for a can crusher?

Most countertop models require only a small footprint, measuring around 12 inches by 12 inches. These are ideal for kitchen or office use. 

For larger storage spaces or commercial use, consider floor-standing models that may need a 24-inch by 24-inch base.
