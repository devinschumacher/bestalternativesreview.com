## Buyer's Guide

Martha Stewart's towel collection combines luxury textiles with practical functionality. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the perfect towels for your home. 


### Material Quality

Opt for towels made from premium cotton, such as Egyptian or Pima varieties, which offer superior softness and durability. Look for high-thread-count options (600 threads per square inch or higher) that provide both plush comfort and increased longevity. 


### Size and Design

Standard bath towels measure approximately 30" x 60", while hand towels are typically 12" x 18". Kitchen towels usually come in 18" x 27" dimensions. Consider the space and usage before selecting quantities and sizes. Martha Stewart offers both solid-color and patterned designs, so match your towels to your existing decor. 


### Breathability and Absorbency

Higher-quality towels wick moisture away from the skin more efficiently. Look for towels with a texture that feels slightly rough to the touch, indicating natural air holes that enhance breathability while maintaining comfort. 


### Care Requirements

Most Martha Stewart towels can be machine washed on a gentle cycle using mild detergent. Avoid fabric softeners as they can reduce towel absorbency. For optimal preservation, dry towels thoroughly after each wash and store them loosely to maintain their shape and softness.
