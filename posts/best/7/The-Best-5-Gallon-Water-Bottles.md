### What is the capacity of a 5-gallon water bottle?

A standard 5-gallon water bottle has a capacity of 64 U. S. fluid ounces or 1.89 liters. This measurement is based on the most common water bottle size, but some variations may exist.

### What materials are commonly used for 5-gallon water bottles?

Most 5-gallon water bottles are made from food-grade plastic, specifically polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or high-density polyethylene (HDPE). These materials are chosen for their durability and ability to resist bacterial growth.

Regular cleaning, proper storage, and using the bottle within its intended capacity can significantly extend its lifespan. Replace any bottle showing signs of wear or damage to ensure safe use. 


### What maintenance requirements do 5-gallon water bottles have?

Regular maintenance for a 5-gallon water bottle includes thorough cleaning after each use and thorough drying before storage. This helps prevent bacterial growth and extends the bottle's life.
