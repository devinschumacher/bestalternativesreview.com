## Buyer's Guide

Easel TV stands offer a unique alternative to traditional console designs, providing a slim, minimalist display solution. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the right stand to complement your space and TV size. 


### Design and Orientation

Easel stands typically feature two vertical supports with a horizontal display surface, creating an open and airy look. Consider the stand's orientation - standard models face forward, while some offer angled or rotated options for better viewing angles. 


### TV Compatibility

The stand's maximum weight capacity, typically measured in pounds or kilograms, should comfortably support your TV's weight plus any additional hardware. Check the stand's dimensions to ensure it matches your TV's width and bezel depth requirements. 


### Stability and Construction

Look for stands with wide bases for improved stability, especially for larger TVs. The construction materials (e. g. , metal, glass, wood) affect both weight capacity and visual appeal. Ensure the stand's internal structure securely holds the TV and prevents tipping. 


### Additional Features

Some easel stands include adjustable feet for leveling, cable management channels, or integrated storage solutions. Consider features that enhance both functionality and aesthetics, such as slim profiles or decorative elements that match your room's design style. 


## FAQ


### What is an Easel TV stand?

Easel TV stands feature a distinctive freestanding design with legs and an adjustable support arm. Unlike traditional wall mounts, these stands allow you to display your TV at an angle that's comfortable for viewing from various positions, particularly in smaller spaces or apartments. 

These stands typically support TVs weighing up to 85 pounds (38 kg) and come with adjustable brackets that allow you to tilt the screen between 0° and 15°. The freestanding nature of easel stands provides stability through their base design, though the adjustable arm restricts depth compared to fixed-wall mounts. 


### What are the benefits of using an Easel TV stand?

Key benefits include flexible viewing angles, improved ergonomics, and stylish freestanding design. These stands can enhance TV placement in rooms where wall space is limited, particularly in apartments or smaller living spaces. 

Adjustable arm designs allow you to find the optimal viewing angle, while the freestanding nature prevents the need for wall mounts. The versatile placement options make them ideal for multi-room setups or rearranging your living space. 


### What are the main limitations of Easel TV stands?

While aesthetically pleasing, their primary limitation is reduced depth compared to wall mounts, which can affect cabinet and furniture placement behind the TV. Additionally, the maximum supported weight is typically between 65-85 pounds, depending on the model. 

The adjustable arm design restricts TV placement to specific dimensions, and heavier TVs may place additional strain on the support mechanism. Installation requires careful measurement to ensure proper screen positioning and stability. 


### How do Easel TV stands compare to wall mounts?

Easel stands offer more flexibility in viewing angles and freestanding design, making them suitable for smaller spaces and uneven wall surfaces. Wall mounts provide deeper TV mounting options and generally support heavier TVs. 

Wall mounts maximize space efficiency by utilizing available wall area, while easel stands can be more visually distinctive. Consider your room dimensions and TV weight when choosing between these options. 


### What features should I consider when selecting an Easel TV stand?

Key features include weight capacity, adjustable arm length and range, and stability ratings. Look for stands with at least 65-pound weight capacity and adjustable brackets with a 0-15° tilt range. 

Stability features like wide bases or additional feet, and sturdy construction materials such as steel or aluminum, are crucial for maintaining TV security. Consider the included cable management options and finishing compatibility with your TV and other components. 


### How do I properly install an Easel TV stand?

Begin by measuring your TV's exact dimensions and ensuring the stand's support arm can accommodate it. Position the stand on a level, stable surface and adjust the support arm according to your desired viewing angle. 

Use appropriate furniture hardware to secure the stand to the TV, following the manufacturer's instructions. Ensure the TV is securely attached and the support arm is locked into position before use. Regular maintenance includes checking all connections and ensuring the stand remains stable during use.
