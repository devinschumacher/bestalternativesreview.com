## Buyer's Guide

A dining room buffet serves both functional and decorative purposes, offering a stylish solution for displaying dishes and serving food. When selecting the right buffet, consider several key factors to ensure it meets your space, style, and practical needs. 


### Size and Space Considerations

Measure your available space carefully before purchasing a buffet. Consider the room's dimensions, doorways, and adjacent furniture. Most buffets come in standard widths of 60 inches, 72 inches, or 96 inches, with depths typically ranging from 22 to 24 inches. Ensure there's enough room for easy access and movement around the piece. 


### Storage and Organization Options

Storage capacity varies significantly between buffets, so consider your specific needs. Multi-tier designs optimize vertical space, while adjustable shelving allows for flexible organization. Many modern buffets feature glass doors on lower cabinets for easy access while maintaining a clean appearance. Drawer options provide discreet storage for linens or smaller items. 


### Mahogany vs. Wood Species

Mahogany offers exceptional durability and rich color, though it's more expensive. Other durable wood options include red oak, maple, and cherry. Consider the finish quality, as premium coatings resist scratches and moisture better than cheaper alternatives. The wood type and finish should complement your existing furniture and room style. 


### Style and Design Elements

Buffets range from formal to casual styles, so choose one that matches your room's aesthetic. Consider the buffet's legs, feet, or base design for added stability and visual appeal. Many modern designs incorporate clean lines and sleek finishes, while traditional styles feature ornate carvings and turned legs. The buffet's proportions should maintain visual balance with other room elements.

Additional considerations include lip depth for plates, wire cutout size for microwave installation, and space between shelves for easy access to stored items.
