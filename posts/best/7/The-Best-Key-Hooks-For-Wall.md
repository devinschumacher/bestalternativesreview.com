## Buyer's Guide

Key hooks are an essential addition to any home, offering practical storage solutions while keeping your walls clean and uncluttered. Understanding the different types of hooks, their weight capacity, and installation requirements will help you choose the right hooks for your needs. 


### Types of Key Hooks

Wall hooks come in various designs, including basic straight hooks, S-hooks, and heavy-duty multi-groove hooks. Choose based on how many keys you need to hang and their size. 


### Weight Capacity Requirements

Consider the weight of your keys and any other items you plan to hang. Most key hooks support between 5-10 pounds, but heavy-duty options can handle up to 50 pounds. Ensure the hooks match your usage to prevent damage and ensure safety. 


### Material Durability

Common materials include wrought iron, stainless steel, and plastic. Wrought iron and stainless steel offer the best durability and resistance to corrosion, ideal for both indoor and outdoor use. For indoor use or decorative purposes, plastic hooks provide a lighter, more affordable option. 


### Installation and Mounting

Most hooks use wall anchors to secure them, with options including molly bolts, expansion bolts, or adhesive anchors. Consider the wall type (drywall, concrete, wood) and choose appropriate mounting hardware to prevent damage and ensure stability. 


## FAQ


### What types of items can I hang with wall hooks?

- Wall surface (drywall, concrete, brick)

Always check the specific weight rating for the hooks you select to ensure they're suitable for your intended use.
