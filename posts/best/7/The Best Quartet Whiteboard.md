### Mounting Options

Quartet whiteboards can be mounted vertically or horizontally, depending on the available space and layout preference. Wall-mounted systems are ideal for fixed installations, while stand-alone options provide flexibility for rearranging the configuration. Some models offer modular mounting plates for adjustable spacing between boards.

The whiteboard surface should be made from quality materials like porcelain-coated steel or premium epoxy resin for durability and ease of cleaning.

![Quartet-Whiteboard-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Quartet-Whiteboard-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the technical requirements?

Each whiteboard needs an electrical outlet for power and a nearby internet connection for online features. For wall-mounting, standard wall studs and mounting hardware are required. The system also needs regular software updates, which can typically be managed through a web browser. 

For best performance, ensure the display space has minimal interference from external light sources, and maintain an unobstructed view of the screen for all users in the room. 


### How do I get started using the whiteboard?

Pairing the whiteboard with your computer, tablet, or phone typically requires downloading a specific app or software from the respective app store. Setup usually involves connecting to the same Wi-Fi network and following on-screen instructions to complete the initial configuration. 

The first-time setup may take 10-15 minutes, after which basic usage can begin immediately. More advanced features and user customization typically require a brief learning period. 

![Quartet-Whiteboard-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Quartet-Whiteboard-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How can I protect the screen from damage?

Using tempered glass protection and following the manufacturer's recommendations for screen mounting can significantly reduce the risk of damage from physical impact. The glass protection also helps maintain visibility and touch responsiveness. 

Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials for cleaning. Instead, use recommended cleaning solutions and soft cloths to maintain the display's clarity and prevent scratching. 


### How long do the batteries last in the included stylus?

The built-in battery in the stylus offers up to 12 hours of continuous use before needing a recharge. Full charge times typically range from 2-3 hours, depending on the usage pattern and battery health. 

To maximize battery life, the stylus automatically enters sleep mode when not in use. Users can adjust settings to control when the stylus enters sleep mode to balance power usage with convenience.
