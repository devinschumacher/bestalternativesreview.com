These products often serve specific functions like enrichment, feeding, or environmental enhancement. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select appropriate items for your pet's needs. 


### Enrichment Products

### Feeding Solutions

Feeding products like treat dishes and water bottles help maintain proper hydration and nutrition. Consider products with adjustable heights for multilevel cage setups or those that prevent tipping.
