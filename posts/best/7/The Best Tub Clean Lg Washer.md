## FAQ


### What is a Tub Clean cycle?

The Tub Clean cycle is a specialized wash cycle designed specifically for cleaning and sanitizing your washing machine's drum and tub. This cycle uses a high-temperature wash and special cleaning agents to remove built-up soap, detergent residue, and bacteria from your machine's interior. 

Running the Tub Clean cycle regularly helps maintain the overall performance and hygiene of your washing machine, extending its lifespan and ensuring better cleaning results for your laundry. 


### How often should I run the Tub Clean cycle?

For optimal machine hygiene, it's recommended to run the Tub Clean cycle quarterly, or more frequently if you notice unusual odors, poor cleaning performance, or visible residue inside the drum. 

If you have hard water or mineral buildup issues, consider running the Tub Clean cycle monthly to prevent scale formation and maintain proper detergent dissolution. 


### What settings should I use for a Tub Clean cycle?

Always select the recommended Tub Clean cycle, which is specifically designed for cleaning your washing machine's interior. This cycle typically runs for 1-2 hours at temperatures ranging from 140-160°F (60-71°C). 

Use the appropriate water level and select a gentle cycle option, as you won't be placing any clothes in the machine during this cycle. The washing machine will automatically add the necessary cleaning agents and rinse thoroughly. 


### Can I add laundry during a Tub Clean cycle?

Never add laundry during a running Tub Clean cycle. The machine's interior needs to be empty for the full cycle to complete its cleaning process effectively. 

After the cycle finishes, if you need to wash a small load of clothes, you can add them to the machine and run a regular wash cycle. The interior will be clean and ready for use. 


### How do I know if the Tub Clean cycle completed successfully?

The washing machine will signal the end of the Tub Clean cycle through its normal completion sequence – typically a series of beeps or a specific display message. 

After the cycle finishes, open the washing machine's door and inspect the interior for any remaining residue or odors. If the interior feels clean and smells fresh, the cycle completed successfully. 


### What should I do if the Tub Clean cycle fails?

If the Tub Clean cycle fails to complete, consult your washing machine's user manual for troubleshooting steps specific to your model. 

If the issue persists, contact LG customer support or a qualified appliance technician for assistance. Common causes of failed cycles include door latches not closing properly or machine issues like power supply problems.
