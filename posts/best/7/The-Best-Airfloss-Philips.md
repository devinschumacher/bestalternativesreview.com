## Buyer's Guide

Airfloss devices from Philips combine water pressure with a precise stream of air to target hard-to-reach areas between teeth and under gumlines. These unique cleaning instruments complement traditional brushing and flossing, helping remove plaque and food particles that cause bad breath and gum disease. 


### Water and Air Technology

Philips Airfloss models use a proprietary blend of water and air pressure to create a powerful stream that cleans teeth effectively while using minimal water. The key components include a reservoir, pump system, and nozzle design that delivers pulses of water and air in a specific sequence to dislodge debris. 


### Cleaning Performance and Reach

The effectiveness of Airfloss devices stems from their ability to reach areas where standard floss might not fit comfortably. The water and air stream can penetrate spaces between teeth as narrow as 0.7 millimeters, making them particularly useful for people with tight contacts or crowded teeth. 


### Comfort and Safety Features

User comfort is prioritized with adjustable water flow settings and ergonomic handles. Safety features include automatic shutoff when the unit is removed from water, and built-in controls to prevent water leakage during use. The devices are generally easy to use but may take some practice to master the proper technique. 


### Maintenance and Usage Tips

Proper maintenance is essential for optimal performance and hygiene. This includes regular cleaning of the nozzle and pump head, descaling the unit weekly to prevent mineral buildup, and using the correct water levels to prevent damage. Usage tips recommend starting with shorter sessions and gradually increasing time as comfort improves. 


## FAQ


### What is an Airfloss?

The Philips Airfloss is an innovative dental care device that uses a stream of pressurized air to remove debris from between teeth and under the gumline. Unlike traditional water flossers, it requires no water and is powered by a small, hand-held device. 

This portable tool uses patented AirFloss technology to create short bursts of air that disrupt and remove particles from tight spaces, making it particularly effective for cleaning around orthodontic appliances and bridgework. 


### How does the Philips Airfloss work?

The Airfloss delivers a stream of pressurized air through a small nozzle. By holding the device next to your teeth and triggering the air pulse, you can target specific areas for cleaning. The force of the air is regulated to prevent damage to enamel and gum tissue. 

The device operates on simple batteries and includes three interchangeable nozzles for different cleaning needs. The included carrying case makes it convenient for travel or daily use at home. 


### What are the benefits of using an Airfloss?

Regular use of the Airfloss can help reduce gingivitis and plaque buildup between teeth, particularly effective for areas difficult to reach with regular brushing and flossing. The device's compact size and portable design allow for convenient cleaning at home or on the go. 

Users may experience improved gum health and reduced sensitivity to hot and cold foods due to the thorough cleaning between teeth and under the gumline. The air-flossing action is gentle on enamel and gum tissue, making it suitable for most oral conditions. 


### Is the Philips Airfloss safe for all dental conditions?

The Airfloss is generally safe for most dental conditions, including gingivitis, periodontal disease, and orthodontic treatments. However, individuals with severe gum recession or certain dental implants should consult their dentist before use. 

Users with braces, bridges, or dental prosthetics should start with short sessions to ensure proper usage technique and monitor their gum health for any changes. 


### How long does the Philips Airfloss battery last?

The Airfloss runs on simple batteries that power the device's motor and air pulse mechanism. After charging, a single set of batteries provides around 4,000 uses per set, equating to approximately 3 months of daily use based on 15-second sessions. 

The device includes an LED indicator that shows when the battery needs recharging. The included charging stand provides quick and convenient battery management for consistent use. 


### How should I maintain my Philips Airfloss?

To keep your Airfloss in optimal condition, clean the device after each use by wiping the nozzle and exterior with a damp cloth. Store the device in its carrying case when not in use to protect it from damage. 

Regularly replace the included nozzles according to your cleaning needs, usually every 3-6 months. The device requires minimal maintenance beyond basic cleaning and occasional battery replacement.
