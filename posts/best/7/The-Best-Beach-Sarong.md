### MATERIAL AND DURABILITY

Most beach sarongs are made from lightweight, quick-drying materials like cotton, polyester, or rayon blends. Higher-quality options feature durable stitching and reinforced grommets for hanging or securing. Consider the care requirements when selecting a material, as some may wrinkle more than others. 


### PRINT AND COLOR OPTIONS

The print and color of your beach sarong can significantly impact its versatility and appeal. Bright patterns and bold colors may be too garish for some settings, while neutral tones lack the visual interest of bolder designs. Consider prints with water-resistant properties to maintain their appearance after repeated washings.

### How should you care for a beach sarong?

Machine wash your beach sarong in cold water with mild detergent to maintain its color and shape. Avoid using bleach or fabric softeners, as they can damage the fabric. 

Air drying is recommended to prevent shrinkage. For quick drying, lay the sarong flat rather than hanging it, as the weight of water can stretch the material. 


### What size should you choose?

Sarongs generally come in one size, which should fit generously around your waist. Most brands recommend measuring from your waist to just above your ankles to determine the appropriate length. 

For additional security, consider measuring with the sarong laid out flat to ensure it's wide enough to wrap comfortably around your body.
