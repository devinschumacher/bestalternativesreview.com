![Maidenform-Flexees-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Maidenform-Flexees-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Are Maidenform Flexees suitable for all body types?

The Flexees collection offers a range of body types and sizes to accommodate various figure shapes, including plus sizes and smaller frames. Each product is designed to provide supportive underpinnings while allowing for natural movement and flexibility. 

However, if you have specific body shape concerns (such as high-backed blouses or wide-set shoulders), it's recommended to consult the sizing chart or contact customer service for personalized guidance. 


### How do Maidenform Flexees compare to athletic-specific brands?

Maidenform Flexees blend the brand's traditional support features with athletic performance fabrics, making them distinct from pure athletic brands that prioritize extreme flexibility over compression and support.

![Maidenform-Flexees-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Maidenform-Flexees-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can these garments be machine washed?

Yes, Maidenform Flexees are machine washable to make them easy to care for. Most items can be washed in warm water with a mild detergent, though some specific care instructions may vary between styles. 

Air drying is recommended to maintain the shape and elasticity of the garments, although some styles may be suitable for drying in the dryer at a low setting. Always check the care label for the most accurate instructions. 


### How long do Maidenform Flexees typically last?

With regular use, Maidenform Flexees can last 6-12 months depending on the frequency and intensity of your workouts, as well as proper care. Signs that indicate it's time to replace your garments include loss of elasticity, changes in the fit, or noticeable wear on the seams and edges.
