For the most accurate results, it's recommended to use the appropriate comb attachment for your pet's specific coat type, which Wahl provides in various configurations to match different breeds and coat lengths. 


### Can Wahl cordless clippers be used for cutting beards and facial hair?

Yes, while primarily designed for pet grooming, Wahl cordless clippers can be used on human hair with caution. The stainless steel blades and adjustable speed settings make them suitable for light trimming and shaping of facial hair, though professional barber tools are recommended for detailed work.

Regular maintenance extends the life of your Wahl clipper and ensures safe operation. After each use, remove the blade assembly and clean the cutting blades with a soft brush to remove any pet hair or debris. The motor housing should be wiped down with a damp cloth. 

Always keep the clippers dry and store them in their original case when not in use. The battery should be charged and discharged at least once a month to maintain its health, and the clipper should be serviced annually by a professional groomer to check for proper function and blade alignment. 


### What is the warranty coverage for Wahl cordless clippers?

All Wahl cordless clippers come with a standard one-year warranty that covers manufacturing defects and provides replacement parts if needed. For the best protection, it's recommended to purchase an extended warranty for an additional two years, which covers accidental damage and loss. 

To keep your warranty valid, proper maintenance and following the manufacturer's care instructions are essential. If you experience issues outside the warranty period, Wahl offers replacement blades and parts directly on their website at a cost.
