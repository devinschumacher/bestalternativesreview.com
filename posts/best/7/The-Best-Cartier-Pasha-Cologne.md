### [Cartier Pasha Cologne](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Cartier+Pasha+Cologne?utm\_term=cartier-pasha-cologne)

At just an inch tall, the miniature bottle holds a disappointingly small amount of the signature masculine scent. The top notes of mint and orange give way to a heart of lavender and Brazilian rosewood, before settling into a rich base of sandalwood and patchouli that delivers the perfume's characteristic depth. Despite the compact size, the fragrance captures the classic Pasha essence, though the price point feels mismatched with the generous spritz volume.
