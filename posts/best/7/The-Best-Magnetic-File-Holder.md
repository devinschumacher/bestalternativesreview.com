## FAQ


### What is a magnetic file holder?

A magnetic file holder is a storage solution that uses magnetic clasps or mounts to secure documents and files on metal surfaces. These holders are popular in offices, garages, and workshops where wall-mounted storage is needed for frequently accessed documents. 

The primary features of magnetic file holders include adjustable clamps, clear or tinted viewing windows, and built-in dividers to organize different types of documents. Some models also feature backlighting for improved visibility when working in low-light conditions. 


### What types of documents can be stored in magnetic folders?

Magnetic folders can hold various types of documents, including printed sheets, photos, receipts, and letter-sized documents. Most magnetic folders have a weight capacity of 4-6 sheets per pocket, making them suitable for lightweight paper materials. 

These folders are available in different sizes and capacities, from single-page pockets to expandable multi-section folders. Some specialized magnetic folders are designed for thicker documents, such as ledger sheets or bound books. 


### What are the advantages of using magnetic file holders?

Magnetic file holders offer several advantages, including space-saving wall-mounted storage, quick document access, and organization through clear viewing windows. They prevent dog-earing of documents and protect papers from dust and dirt. 

These folders are ideal for professionals who need organized access to frequently consulted documents. They work particularly well in environments with limited desk space or for individuals who value a tidy workspace free from cluttered surfaces. 


### How do magnetic folders compare to traditional paper clips and binders?

Magnetic folders provide several advantages over traditional paper clips and binders. Unlike paper clips, they keep documents firmly in place without distortion, and unlike binders, which can be bulky and take up desk space, magnetic folders mount to walls. 

These folders also offer better organization through clear viewing windows and multiple pockets, making it easier to find specific documents quickly. Additionally, magnetic folders present a cleaner, more professional appearance compared to loose-leaf stacks or multiple binders. 


### How should magnetic folders be maintained?

To maintain magnetic folders, regular cleaning is essential. Wipe the magnetic surface with a dry cloth to remove dust and debris. For stubborn stains, use a mild cleaning solution and water, avoiding harsh chemicals that might damage the plastic or metal surfaces. 

Check each magnetic clasp regularly to ensure it maintains proper tension and continues to secure documents effectively. If the clasp becomes weak or fails, replace the magnetic backing immediately to prevent document loss. 


### What is the typical lifespan of a magnetic file holder?

The lifespan of a magnetic file holder depends on its usage and the quality of materials. With regular use in a home or office setting, most magnetic folders last 5-10 years before showing signs of wear, such as weakened magnetic strength or worn clasp mechanisms. 

To extend the life of your magnetic folders, store them in a dry environment protected from extreme temperature changes. Handling them carefully during removal and insertion of documents will also reduce stress on the magnetic components.
