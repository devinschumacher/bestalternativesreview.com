## FAQ


### What is Chebe powder?

Chebe powder is a natural hair care product made from the dried roots of the Chebe plant. The powder is rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that promote healthy hair growth and strengthen hair follicles. 

Its key ingredients include vitamin A, calcium, iron, and phosphorus, which help in nourishing the scalp and restoring hair vibrancy. The powder is often used as a natural hair therapy to treat hair loss, dandruff, and dry scalp conditions. 


### How does Chebe powder work?

Chebe powder works by providing essential nutrients directly to the hair follicles through scalp application. The vitamins and minerals help improve blood circulation to the scalp, promoting healthier hair growth and reducing hair fall. 

The powder also acts as a natural detoxifier for the scalp, removing dead skin cells and excess oil that can block hair follicles. This improves overall scalp health and prepares the scalp for better hair growth. 


### Is Chebe powder suitable for all hair types?

Yes, Chebe powder can be beneficial for all hair types. Its natural properties help to balance the scalp's pH level, making it particularly effective for both dry and oily scalp conditions. However, individuals with chemical-processed hair might need to perform a patch test first to ensure compatibility. 

For best results, it's recommended to follow the product instructions and avoid frequent application, especially on sensitive skin types, to prevent irritation. 


### How should Chebe powder be applied?

To apply Chebe powder, mix a small amount with water to form a paste. Gently massage this mixture onto your scalp and hair, focusing on areas with noticeable hair loss or scalp issues. Leave it on for 15-20 minutes before rinsing thoroughly with cool water. 

For optimal results, use this treatment 2-3 times a week. Always perform a patch test first to ensure no allergic reactions occur. 


### What results can I expect from using Chebe powder?

Many users report improved scalp health within 2-4 weeks of regular use, including reduced dandruff, increased scalp hydration, and enhanced hair strength. Hair loss reduction and improved hair texture are typically observed after 4-8 weeks of consistent application. 

While results vary, most users notice significant improvements in their hair health and appearance. Continued use is recommended for long-term benefits. 


### Are there any potential side effects?

Most users experience no side effects when using Chebe powder. However, some may experience temporary scalp irritation or sensitivity, especially if using it for the first time or applying it too frequently. If you notice redness, itching, or worsening scalp condition, discontinue use and consult a dermatologist. 

Allergic reactions are rare but possible. If you experience any unusual symptoms, stop using the product and seek medical advice.
