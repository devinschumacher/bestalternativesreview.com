## Buyer's Guide

Choosing the right sun, moon, and stars perfume involves considering fragrance notes, intensity, and longevity. This guide helps you select a scent that aligns with your preferences and needs.

### Intensity

These perfumes range from light to intense. If you prefer a subtle scent, opt for eau de colognes with 2-4% concentration. For a more noticeable presence, choose eau de parfums with 15-20% concentration. Consider how long you want the fragrance to last before selecting your intensity level.
