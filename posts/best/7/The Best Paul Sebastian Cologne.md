## Buyer's Guide

Paul Sebastian Cologne, introduced by fashion designer Paul Sebastian in 1989, combines sharpness with sweetness in its distinctive scent. The fragrance has evolved over the years, with modern versions retaining the original's signature characteristics while offering improved formulation and longevity. 


### Top Notes

Top notes set the initial fragrance impression and should be the most noticeable aspect of a scent. In Paul Sebastian Cologne, these include bright citrus elements like bergamot and tangerine, followed by zesty notes of grapefruit and mandarin. These top notes are typically the most volatile and dissipate quickly, making them crucial for immediate impact.

### Heart Notes

Heart notes emerge after the top notes fade, shaping the fragrance's core character. For Paul Sebastian Cologne, these middle notes often contain a rich combination of rose, jasmine, and ylang-ylang. These floral elements balance the freshness of the top notes, creating a layer of complexity that enhances the overall composition. 


### Base Notes

Base notes form the foundation of a fragrance, contributing depth and longevity. Traditional elements in Paul Sebastian Cologne base notes might include warm vanilla, rich musk, and subtle woods.
