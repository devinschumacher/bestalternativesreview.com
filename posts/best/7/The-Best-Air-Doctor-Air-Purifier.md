## Buyer's Guide

Investing in an air doctor air purifier can significantly improve indoor air quality, but with numerous options available, it's important to understand what features to look for. This guide outlines key considerations to help you select the right purifier for your needs. 


### The Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR)

The CADR measures how effectively a purifier removes smoke, dust, and pollen from the air. Higher CADR values indicate better performance. Consider models with CADR ratings that match your room size to ensure efficient filtration. 


### Hepa Filtration and True HEPA Technology

HEPA filters capture 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns, including dust, pollen, and pet dander. True HEPA filters meet stricter manufacturing standards, ensuring optimal performance. While more expensive, the improved filtration efficiency often justifies the cost. 


### Multifilter Systems

Modern air purifiers often incorporate multiple filtration stages. Pre-filters capture large particles, extending filter life and reducing maintenance. Activated carbon filters handle odors and gases, while UV germicidal lights eliminate bacteria and viruses. Evaluate which contaminants you need to address to determine the necessary filtration components. 


### Silent Operation and Timer Features

For overnight use or quiet operation during the day, look for models rated at less than 25 decibels. Timer functions allow unattended operation, automatically turning the unit off after specific intervals to save energy and maintain consistent air quality. 


## FAQ


### How effective are Air Doctor air purifiers in removing common indoor pollutants?

Our air purifiers are designed to eliminate a wide range of indoor pollutants, including dust, pollen, smoke, and odors. The CADR rating, which measures cleaning efficiency, varies between models but typically falls between 300 and 400 CFM, making them effective for rooms up to 300 square feet. 

The purifiers use a multi-stage filtration system, including a pre-filter, true HEPA filter, and activated carbon filter, which work together to capture both large particles and microscopic pollutants. The efficiency of the filtration can reduce airborne particles by up to 99.97%. 


### How much maintenance does an Air Doctor air purifier require?

The maintenance requirements vary by model, but most Air Doctor air purifiers need basic maintenance monthly. This includes checking the pre-filter for dirt accumulation and replacing it when needed, typically every 3-6 months depending on usage and environmental conditions. 

The true HEPA filter should be replaced every 12-24 months, while the activated carbon filter needs to be changed every 6-12 months based on usage. Following the recommended maintenance schedule ensures optimal performance and air quality. 


### How much noise does an Air Doctor air purifier produce?

The operating noise level is an important consideration for home and office use. Our standard model operates at a quiet 23 decibels on its lowest setting, making it suitable for use in bedrooms and offices where silent operation is preferred. 

The higher settings increase the fan speed, which can reach 35 decibels on the highest setting. The air purifier includes a timer function that automatically switches to the lowest setting after three hours, providing a gentle night-time mode. 


### What are the energy consumption specifications for Air Doctor air purifiers?

Energy consumption varies by model but is designed to be efficient based on daily usage patterns. The standard model consumes approximately 25 watts on the lowest setting and 50 watts on the highest setting, making it comparable to other mid-range air purifiers in terms of power usage. 

Over a year, this translates to an estimated 36 kWh of electricity, which is relatively low compared to space heaters or other household appliances. The energy efficiency ratio is optimized for both performance and cost-effectiveness. 


### Can Air Doctor air purifiers be used in different room sizes?

The appropriate room size for an Air Doctor air purifier depends on the specific model's CADR rating and air flow measurement. Our standard model is designed for rooms up to 300 square feet, while the larger model handles rooms up to 600 square feet. 

Using the purifier in a room that is too large may reduce its effectiveness, while using it in a room that is too small may not utilize its full capacity. Proper sizing ensures optimal air quality and efficient operation. 


### Do Air Doctor air purifiers work with smart home systems?

Our air purifiers can be integrated into smart home systems that support third-party connectivity. This allows users to control the purifier's settings, monitor air quality, and receive alerts through compatible smart home platforms. 

Pairing with a smart home system provides more control and convenience, but the air purifiers function independently and can be used with or without smart home integration. The system compatibility is noted in the product specifications.
