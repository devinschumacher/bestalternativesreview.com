### Size and Proportion

Measure your available space before selecting a table size. Aim for one that's approximately 1.5 to 2 times the length of your sofa's seating area. The table's proportions should match your room's dimensions – longer spaces benefit from narrower tables, while smaller rooms look best with slightly larger fixtures.

### What is tessellated stone?

Tessellated stone is a type of natural stone that displays distinct, repeating geometric patterns on its surface. These patterns are formed during the stone's creation process and give each piece a unique, almost tile-like appearance. 

Unlike traditional tiles, tessellated stone maintains a natural quality with minor variations in color and pattern. The patterns are often reminiscent of brickwork or stone masonry, making each piece distinct while maintaining a cohesive design element. 


### How are tessellated stone coffee tables made?

Tessellated stone coffee tables start with large slabs of natural stone that naturally display the desired geometric patterns. These slabs are then carefully cut into specific shapes and sizes to create the table top. The edges are typically finished with a bevel or chamfer for a clean, modern look. 

The stone slabs are usually between 1 to 2 inches thick, providing a substantial feel while maintaining manageable weight for handling and transport.

### What care is required for tessellated stone?

Regular maintenance for tessellated stone coffee tables involves cleaning with a soft cloth and mild soap, followed by a clear water rinse. Avoid abrasive cleaners or harsh chemicals that could damage the stone's surface. 

Like other natural stone pieces, tessellated stone coffee tables should be protected with a quality sealant to prevent staining. Promptly wipe up spills to prevent absorption into the stone's surface. 


### Can tessellated stone coffee tables be customized?

Tessellated stone coffee tables can be customized through various means. The most common customization is through edge finishing, with options ranging from simple straight edges to decorative chamfers or bevels. 

Color variations can also be achieved through different stone selections, though the distinctive patterns of tessellated stone generally remain consistent across pieces of the same type.

### What are the weight and size considerations?

A standard tessellated stone coffee table will weigh between 30 to 60 pounds, with dimensions typically ranging from 24 to 48 inches in length and 20 to 30 inches in width. These dimensions account for the 1 to 2 inch thickness of the stone slabs. 

Size and weight increase with larger tabletops, so consider the space and lifting capacity of your location when selecting a table that matches your needs. 


### Where can I find tessellated stone coffee tables?

Tessellated stone coffee tables are available from a variety of home decor retailers, including specialized stone furniture companies and large home goods stores. Look for dealers that offer customization options and regular maintenance products for optimal care. 

Custom manufacturers may offer more extensive personalization options, while larger retailers provide wider selection and potentially better pricing for mass-produced pieces.
