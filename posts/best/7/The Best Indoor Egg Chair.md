## Buyer's Guide

Indoor egg chairs combine extreme comfort with an iconic design, making them a popular addition to home lounges and offices. These cozy seats feature a rounded, egg-like shape that cradles the body, available in various materials from plush foam to premium leather options. 


### Size and Space Considerations

When selecting an indoor egg chair, measure the available space carefully. The chair's diameter typically ranges from 30 to 50 inches, so ensure you have enough room for comfortable seating and movement. Also, consider the chair's weight capacity, usually between 200 and 300 pounds, to match your intended users. 


### Suspension System Analysis

Egg chairs rely on a specific suspension system to maintain their distinctive shape while supporting the sitter's weight. The most common systems use metal grids or wire frames covered in plush material. Evaluate the chair's construction quality and material durability to ensure long-term support and comfort.

Built-in heaters can extend the chair's functionality into cooler months, while massage mechanisms enhance relaxation capabilities. 


## FAQ


### What is an indoor egg chair?

Indoor egg chairs, also known as pod chairs or relaxation chairs, are unique pieces of furniture that offer a cocoon-like embrace for the user. These chairs typically feature a rounded, organic shape with minimal legs, creating a visual contrast with traditional seating. 

The design of an indoor egg chair combines ergonomic comfort with architectural interest, making them popular additions to living rooms, home offices, and relaxation spaces. 


### What materials are indoor egg chairs made from?

Most indoor egg chairs are constructed from molded foam or polyurethane, with a layer of upholstery covering the exterior. High-quality models may use premium foam cores, memory foam inserts, or eco-friendly materials for the shell and cushioning. 

The upholstery can be made from various materials including bonded leather, premium fabric, or performance fabrics designed for durability and ease of cleaning. 


### How do you care for an indoor egg chair?

Regular maintenance for an indoor egg chair includes vacuuming the upholstery weekly and spot cleaning any spills or stains immediately to prevent them from setting. Most manufacturers recommend using a mild soap solution and avoiding harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners. 

After cleaning, allow the chair to air dry completely before use. For deeper cleaning or removal of stubborn stains, refer to the manufacturer's specific care instructions. 


### How much space do I need for an indoor egg chair?

Standard indoor egg chairs require a minimum of 24 inches of space between the chair and any surrounding objects. This allows for comfortable movement and prevents accidental bumps or scratches on the sides of the chair. 

Plan for approximately 36 inches of space between the chair and chair legs to allow for proper support and prevent the chair from tipping over. 


### How much does an indoor egg chair weigh?

The weight of an indoor egg chair varies based on materials and construction. Basic models made from molded foam might weigh around 35-40 pounds, while premium versions with memory foam inserts and metal legs can weigh between 50-70 pounds. 

When purchasing, consider the weight capacity and base design of the chair to ensure it's stable and safe for your specific needs. 


### Are indoor egg chairs easy to assemble?

Most indoor egg chairs come fully assembled from the manufacturer, making them straightforward to place in your desired location. Basic models typically require minimal handling, while some premium versions may need basic tools for assembly of legs or frame components. 

If assembly is necessary, expect to spend 1-2 hours setting up your chair, depending on the complexity of the design and your own comfort level with DIY projects.
