## Buyer's Guide

A body mirror with lights combines practicality with visibility, making it an essential tool for inspecting your vehicle's exterior. These mirrors feature built-in lighting that illuminates dark corners, helping you spot damage, wear, or maintenance needs that might otherwise be hidden in shadows. 


### Lighting Features

When selecting a body mirror with lights, consider bulbs with at least 15 watts of power for adequate illumination. LED bulbs are energy-efficient and provide consistent brightness without flickering. Some mirrors offer adjustable brightness levels, allowing you to customize the lighting based on your surroundings and time of day. 


### Mirror Design and Size

The mirror's size should match common automotive mirrors, typically 20-24 inches in diameter. Consider the mirror's shape - oval or rectangular mirrors can offer larger viewing areas, while round mirrors provide a more traditional appearance. The mirror should rotate to align with your inspection needs, with at least 270-degree rotation being ideal. 


### Base and Stand Options

Some body mirrors come with tripods or base stands that allow them to be positioned anywhere. Tripods often offer more stability but take up more space. Base stands with adjustable legs can be more discreet but may require frequent repositioning. Ensure the base can support the mirror's weight (usually 2-3 pounds) and has a secure feet design to prevent tipping. 


### Connecting Methods

There are two primary ways to attach body mirrors: magnetic mount or universal mounting adapter. Magnetic mounts are simple to install but may not be suitable for vehicles with unpainted metal surfaces or those moved frequently. Universal mounting adapters require more installation time but work with a wider range of vehicle types, including painted, polished, or covered surfaces.

### What maintenance requirements do these mirrors have?

The LED lights in these mirrors are generally low-maintenance and have a long lifespan. However, regular dusting of the mirror surface and cleaning of the light sources is recommended to maintain optimal performance.
