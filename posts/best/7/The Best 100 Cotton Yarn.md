## FAQ

![100-Cotton-Yarn-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/100-Cotton-Yarn-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is 100 cotton yarn?

100 cotton yarn is a type of yarn made entirely from cotton fibers. This means it contains no other materials like polyester or wool, making it a pure cotton product. 

Cotton yarn is popular for its natural feel, breathability, and moisture-wicking properties. It's often used in garment construction, home textiles, and crafting projects that require a lightweight, breathable material. 


### What are the benefits of 100 cotton yarn?

100 cotton yarn offers several advantages, including natural moisture absorption, which helps keep fabrics dry and comfortable. It's also highly breathable, making it ideal for everyday wear and home textiles. 

The material has excellent durability when properly cared for and resists shrinkage well. Additionally, it works well with both wet and dry felting techniques, making it versatile for various crafting projects. 

![100-Cotton-Yarn-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/100-Cotton-Yarn-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How does 100 cotton yarn compare to cotton blends?

Cotton blends combine cotton with other fibers like polyester, which can increase durability and reduce cost. However, these blends often lack the natural qualities of pure cotton yarn, such as its moisture-wicking properties and softer hand feel. 

Pure cotton yarn maintains its natural characteristics while offering excellent quality and texture. These properties make it a preferred choice for sensitive skin and those who value natural materials in their textiles. 


### What projects are suitable for 100 cotton yarn?

Cotton yarn pairs well with natural dyes and produces vibrant colors while maintaining its soft texture. It's ideal for creating lightweight garments, home textiles like pillowcases and washcloths, and soft toys with a natural feel. 

The material's strength allows it to be used in both woven and knitted projects. It works particularly well in lightweight fabrics for summer clothing and in breathable home textiles for warm weather. 

![100-Cotton-Yarn-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/100-Cotton-Yarn-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How should 100 cotton yarn be cared for?

These yarns perform best when washed and dried separately using cold water and air drying methods. Gentle detergents without bleach are recommended to maintain color and fiber integrity. 

When selecting needles or hooks, choose ones slightly larger than recommended for the yarn weight to prevent over-tight stitches and maintain the natural drape of the fabric. 


### What are some popular brands that produce 100 cotton yarn?

Popular brands that produce high-quality 100 cotton yarn include Patons, Red Heart, and Lion Brand. These brands offer a range of weights and dye lots, making it easy to find the right yarn for your project. 

When selecting a brand, look for yarns specifically marketed as 100% cotton with detailed care instructions. Check for softness, strength, and consistency in color across different dye lots to ensure quality.
