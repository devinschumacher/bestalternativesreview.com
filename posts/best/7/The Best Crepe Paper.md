## Buyer's Guide

Crepes paper combines affordability with versatility, making it a popular choice for parties, crafts, and decorations. Here's what to consider when selecting your crepe paper supply. 


### Material Quality

Crepes paper ranges in quality from thin, flimsy sheets to thick, durable ones. Higher-quality papers resist tearing and maintain their crisp fold lines, making them ideal for detailed decorations. Consider the intended use: thinner paper works well for small projects and party decor, while thicker paper handles better for tablecloths and furniture covers.

### Color Options

Modern crepe paper offers an extensive color selection, from pastel shades to metallic finishes. The color variety allows for both simple and elaborate designs. However, consider that the quality of printed designs often varies with color depth. Lighter hues maintain their vibrancy better than dark or mixed-color combinations. 


### Size and Roll Length

Standard crepe paper rolls measure 22" x 660', but specialty sizes for table coverings can extend to 50 feet per roll. The roll length impacts project quantities – longer rolls reduce waste and multiple rolls provide flexibility for larger spaces or outdoor events. For smaller projects, the shorter standard rolls suffice.

### Value Considerations

When comparing prices, look beyond initial cost to consider roll length and material quality. While premium crepe paper might seem expensive upfront, its durability and quality often result in better value over time. Bulk purchases usually offer the best unit price but may not be practical if you're only occasional user.

### How Should Crepe Paper be Stored?

Always store crepe paper in a cool, dry place to maintain its quality and prevent moisture damage. If you cut the paper into small pieces, consider storing these in an airtight container to prevent them from drying out or becoming too moist. 

Avoid folding crepe paper when possible, as the texture makes it prone to developing marks and creases. Instead, roll it loosely or store it flat in a padded envelope when transporting or storing. 


### What is the Best Way to Cut Crepe Paper?

Use sharp scissors designed for paper crafts to cut crepe paper. The scissors should be clean and sharp to prevent the paper from tearing. If you need to cut many pieces, consider using a paper-cutting mat to protect your cutting surface and maintain clean cuts. 

For straight cuts, use a ruler as a guide. For more intricate shapes, consider a paper pattern or template to help maintain accuracy. Crepe paper tends to tear easily, so work quickly and carefully when cutting.

### Can Crepe Paper be Washed?

Most crepe paper products, especially those made for crafts and decorations, are not suitable for washing. The texture and strength of the paper make it prone to damage when wet, and many inks and paints used in craft projects will not adhere well to crepe paper. 

For decorative uses, consider using washable alternatives or applying adhesive-backed elements to your project instead of using paper that might need to be washed later. 


### What are the Safety Considerations for Using Crepe Paper?

Crepe paper is generally safe for crafting and decoration, but it should be handled with care, especially when working with young children. Sharp edges and ragged cuts can pose a risk of injury, so always use scissors and blades carefully. 

While crepe paper is resistant to many chemicals, it's important to note that some inks and adhesives may damage the paper's texture over time. When using crepe paper for crafts that might expose it to moisture or chemicals, select products specifically designed for those applications.
