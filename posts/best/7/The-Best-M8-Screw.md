## Buyer's Guide

M8 screws represent a versatile fastening solution across various applications. Understanding their specifications and choosing the right variety requires attention to several key aspects. 


### Size and Thread Specifications

M8 screws follow ISO metric standards, measuring 8 millimeters in nominal diameter. The actual shank diameter is slightly smaller, typically around 7 millimeters. The nominal diameter determines the screw's compatibility with corresponding holes and nuts. Understanding these measurements ensures proper fit and function in your application. 


### Drive Types and Compatibility

M8 screws commonly feature Slotted (Phillips-head), Phillips, Torx, or Allen drive types. The choice of drive affects tool compatibility and torque application. Slotted and Phillips are the most universal but offer less torque capacity. Torx and Allen drivers provide better torque control and are less likely to cam out during use. 


### Metric versus Imperial Standards

While M8 specifically denotes metric standards, some applications may require imperial equivalents. Convert 8 millimeters to approximately 0.315 inches for imperial measurements. Use metric drives with metric screws and imperial drives with imperial counterparts to ensure proper tool compatibility and torque application. 


### Material and Coating Options

M8 screws come in various materials including carbon steel, stainless steel, brass, and aluminum. Material selection depends on load requirements and environmental exposure. Stainless steel offers corrosion resistance but may be more expensive. Coatings like zinc plating or nickel provide additional protection against rust and wear. 


## FAQ


### What is an M8 screw?

M8 screws are a specific size and type of fastener in the metric system. The "M" stands for metric, and the "8" refers to the screw's nominal diameter, which is 8 millimeters. 

These screws typically feature a coarse thread and a cylindrical shank with a countersunk head, making them suitable for a wide range of wood and metal applications. 


### What are the main uses of M8 screws?

M8 screws are commonly used in construction, furniture assembly, and machine mounting. They provide a reliable way to join wood, plastic, and thin metal pieces together. 

The coarse thread design makes them particularly effective in soft materials like pine and MDF, while the cylindrical shank provides good holding power in many applications. 


### What is the length selection range for M8 screws?

M8 screws are available in a variety of lengths, typically ranging from 15mm to 60mm. The specific length needed depends on the application and the depth of the material being fastened. 

Common length increments include 5mm, 10mm, and 20mm, allowing precise selection based on space constraints and material thickness. 


### What are the different types of M8 screw drives?

Standard M8 screws come with three common drive types: Phillips, flathead (slotted), and Torx. The choice of drive type depends on the tooling available and personal preference. 

Phillips drives are the most versatile and widely used, while Torx provides better torque control and is less likely to strip in tight spaces. 


### What materials are M8 screws made from?

M8 screws are typically made from one of three grades: A2, A4, and stainless steel. The material choice depends on the application's requirements for corrosion resistance and strength. 

A2-grade carbon steel is suitable for general-purpose applications, A4-grade stainless steel offers excellent corrosion resistance, and A2-grade offers a balance of strength and price. 


### How should M8 screws be stored?

M8 screws should be stored in a dry environment to prevent rust and damage. Organize them by size and type in labeled containers or dedicated screw storage systems. 

Apply a light coating of anti-corrosive oil or lubricant to the screw threads before storage to protect them from environmental damage.
