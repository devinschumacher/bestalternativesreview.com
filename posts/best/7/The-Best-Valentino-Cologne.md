## Buyer's Guide

Valentino's colognes blend classic fragrance elements with modern interpretations, offering something for every preference. Understanding the key ingredients and scent categories will help you find the right fragrance. 


### Top Notes

Top notes are the first scents to hit your nose and last for about 2-3 minutes. Common top notes in Valentino fragrances include citrus (like bergamot or lemon), green notes (think fresh leafy scents), and spices. These ingredients create the initial impression of the fragrance.

### Heart Notes

Heart notes emerge after the top notes fade and persist for around 30-60 minutes. This layer typically features floral scents (roses, jasmine), fruity aromas (peach, raspberry), or herbal notes. The heart notes form the core character of the fragrance. 


### Base Notes

Base notes develop approximately 30 minutes after application and can last several hours. These ingredients give a fragrance its longevity and depth. Common base notes in Valentino fragrances include vanilla, woods (sandalwood, cedar), and musk. They create the final dry-down character of the scent.

Sillage refers to how far a fragrance travels in the air, while longevity indicates how long it lasts on the skin. Valentino's premium formulas generally offer moderate sillage and decent longevity. Environmental factors like humidity and body temperature affect how a fragrance performs, so consider this when evaluating different options.
