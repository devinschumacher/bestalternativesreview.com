### Privacy Levels

Mirror window tints range from 10% to 40% visibility, allowing you to control how much external view is retained.

## FAQ


### What is mirror window tint?

Mirror window tint, also known as anti-reflective film or heat-absorbing film, is a specialized window tint designed to reduce glare and heat from sunlight while maintaining visibility and privacy.

Mirror window tint is typically applied using a precision-cut film that is professionally installed. The process requires specialized equipment and expertise to ensure a proper seal and eliminate air bubbles.

The primary benefits include improved privacy, reduced glare from sunlight, and heat rejection. These features help maintain a comfortable indoor temperature while reducing energy costs associated with air conditioning.
