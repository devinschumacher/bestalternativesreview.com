## FAQ


### What sets the Babyletto Lolly apart from other baby cribs?

The Babyletto Lolly stands out due to its innovative reversible design. The crib can be used as a standard crib with safety railings on both sides, or flipped over to become a spacious playmat without safety barriers, making it versatile for different stages of your baby's development. 

This unique design eliminates the need for multiple investments - you get both a crib and a playmat in one piece of furniture, which is particularly beneficial for small living spaces or families with multiple children. 


### How does the Babyletto Lolly support safe sleeping practices?

The Lolly features a reversible design that transforms from a safety-featured crib to a playmat, allowing for age-appropriate adjustments. When used as a crib, it adheres to safety standards with 2.25-inch side rails and a tightly fitted mattress that prevents gaps. 

The playmat configuration eliminates the need for traditional crib accessories, reducing clutter and the risk of entanglement hazards. Both configurations promote safe sleep practices aligned with current infant sleep guidelines. 


### What materials and finishes are used in the construction of the Babyletto Lolly?

The Lolly is crafted from solid birch wood with a natural wood grain finish that enhances its durability and aesthetic appeal. The solid wood construction ensures lasting quality and resistance to wear and tear. 

Each piece is finished with water-based, non-toxic stains and protective sealants that protect the wood while maintaining a clean and healthy environment for your baby. 


### Can the Babyletto Lolly be converted into a toddler bed?

While the Lolly doesn't convert directly into a toddler bed, its design allows for easy transition. Once your child outgrows the playmat stage, you can remove the safety railings to create a wider sleeping space, though it won't have the same safety features as a traditional toddler bed. 

It's advisable to upgrade to a toddler bed with better support and safety standards for children who have outgrown the need for the playmat configuration. 


### What are the space requirements for the Babyletto Lolly?

The Lolly measures 63 inches long and 31 inches wide when used as a crib and 46 inches long when used as a playmat. It requires approximately 30 inches of clearance on both sides and 60 inches of ceiling height when used as a crib. 

When used as a playmat, it needs 31 inches of clearance on one side and 46 inches of ceiling height. The compact design makes it suitable for both apartment and suburban living. 


### How does the Babyletto Lolly compare in price to similar products?

While specific pricing varies by retailer, the Babyletto Lolly generally falls within the same price range as comparable convertible cribs. You typically pay between $600 and $800, offering flexibility in budgeting versus purchasing separate crib and playmat options. 

Considering the Lolly's dual functionality, it often provides better value through its cost-effective combination of crib and playmat, making it a practical choice even at its higher end of the price spectrum.
