## Buyer's Guide

Medium knotless braids combine style and versatility for various hair types and lengths. Understanding the key features and considerations can help you select the right braid style and technique for your hair. 


### 1. Braiding Techniques

Mastering basic knotless braids is essential. These techniques involve cross-stitching and looping to create seamless braids without knots. Advanced styles like fishtail and box braids require practice to maintain a smooth finish.

### 2. Hair Considerations

Fine or damaged hair may need additional prep with leave-in conditioner. Curly or wavy hair types can achieve knotless braids with proper moisturizing. Straight hair may benefit from texturizing products for better grip during the braiding process. 


### 3. Braid Length and Width

Shaving or trimming hair before braiding ensures a neater result. Longer hair allows for wider braids, while shorter hair is better suited for narrower styles. Consider your face shape and neckline when choosing braid length.

### 4. Maintenance and Removal

Proper care extends braid longevity. Regular light washing with a suitable shampoo prevents tangling. To remove braids, work through the hair with a wide-tooth comb and gently pull out sections, starting from the ends.
