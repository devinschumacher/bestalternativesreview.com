## Buyer's Guide

Acrylic paint sealers protect your artwork from damage while enhancing its appearance. Understanding the key aspects of these products helps you select the right sealer for your project. 


### Water Resistance

Most acrylic sealers provide water resistance, but varying levels make them suitable for different applications. Indoor projects typically require less water resistance than outdoor pieces facing regular weather exposure. 


### Cleavage Tolerance

Some sealers contain materials that can cause paints to crack and flake over time. High cleavage tolerance ensures your sealer won't compromise your paint's integrity, especially important for multi-layered works. 


### UV Protection

For outdoor artwork or pieces exposed to significant sunlight, UV protection becomes crucial. UV-resistant sealers significantly increase the longevity of your artwork by preventing color fading and degradation. 


### Application and Finishing

Acrylic sealers come in various forms including sprays, brushes, and rollers. Each application method affects the sealer's drying time and finish. Choose a consistency and application technique that matches your project's requirements. 


## FAQ


### What is an acrylic paint sealer?

An acrylic paint sealer is a clear coating applied to painted surfaces to protect the paint and enhance its durability. It helps prevent fading, water damage, and scratches while maintaining the paint's color and gloss. 

Acrylic sealers are preferred for outdoor and high-wear applications due to their excellent chemical resistance and ability to protect against UV rays. 


### How do acrylic paint sealers work?

Acrylic sealers form a protective barrier on the surface of the painted object, creating a layer that blocks moisture, UV radiation, and other environmental factors from affecting the paint underneath. 

These sealers penetrate the paint film slightly, creating a strong bond between the sealer and the painted surface while maintaining breathability to prevent trapped moisture. 


### What types of surfaces can I use an acrylic sealer on?

Acrylic sealers are suitable for a wide range of surfaces including wood, metal, concrete, and masonry. They work well on both indoor and outdoor projects, from furniture and flooring to sculptures and wall coatings. 

These sealers are compatible with most types of paint, including oil-based and water-based paints, but are not recommended for use on bare wood without a primer. 


### Do I need to apply primer before using an acrylic sealer?

While primer is not always necessary, applying a primer before sealer provides superior protection and adhesion. Primer helps fill surface irregularities and creates a uniform base for the sealer to bond with. 

For bare wood or porous surfaces, using a primer can significantly improve the sealer's performance, but it's not always required for surfaces that already have paint applied. 


### How many coats of sealer do I need?

Most acrylic sealers recommend applying 2-3 thin coats, allowing each coat to dry completely before applying the next. The number of coats may vary based on the surface type and desired level of protection. 

Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for your specific product, as some sealers may require fewer coats for optimal results. 


### Where can I find more information about specific acrylic sealers?

The product instructions, available on most manufacturers' websites, provide detailed application guidelines and recommended curing times. These resources also list compatibility information and environmental considerations. 

Customer reviews and comparison charts on paint supply websites, such as our featured roundup, can help you find the right sealer for your specific project and budget.
