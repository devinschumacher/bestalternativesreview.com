The customization process is simple and usually accessible online through the invitation provider's website. Common customization elements include the wording, background pattern, and butterfly design variations. 


### What materials are the invitations made of?

Butterfly baby shower invitations are typically printed on high-quality paper stock, ranging from matte finish to shimmering foil accents. Some premium options include textured papers and specialty coatings for added visual appeal. 

The backing materials can vary, with many options offering matching envelopes or protective clear sleeves to maintain the invitation's appearance during mailing. 


### How long do I have to order the invitations?
