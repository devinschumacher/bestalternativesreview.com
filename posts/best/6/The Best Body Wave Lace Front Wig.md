### Key Features

### Selecting the Right Length

Bob and shoulder-length styles work well for both short and long face shapes, while longer styles can create visual lengthening effects. Consider how the length will frame your face and complement your personal style. 


### Size and Scalp Coverage

Most body wave wigs come in one-size-fits-most options, but measure your head circumference to ensure a proper fit. The lace front should extend at least 2 inches beyond your hairline to cover any visible wig line.
