## Buyer's Guide

Olympic lifting platforms are essential equipment for serious weightlifters and power athletes. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the right platform for your training needs. 


### Platform Construction and Stability

Olympic platforms typically measure 4 feet by 4 feet and are designed to withstand heavy loads. Construction quality varies; look for platforms made from thick steel plates or welded steel frames. Quality platforms prevent sagging under load and maintain their height during heavy lifts.

### Height Adjustability

Height adjustable platforms allow setting multiple working positions. Common height ranges are 23-35 inches for snatch and 24-36 inches for clean and jerk. Consider platforms with smooth, quick-release height adjustment mechanisms to facilitate rapid setup changes. 


### Mats and Safety Features

The platform surface should be covered with dense foam or rubber mats for impact absorption. Some platforms feature built-in safety features like non-slip edges or protective side panels to prevent bars from rolling off during dropped lifts.
