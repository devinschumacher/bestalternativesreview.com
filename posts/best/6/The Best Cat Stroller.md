Cat strollers vary in size, from small backpack carriers to larger, push-in strollers. Consider your cat's size, with most backpack carriers suitable for cats up to 10 pounds.

### Covering and Ventilation

Select a stroller with a secure, protective covering that prevents your cat from escaping. The cover should be made of breathable material to maintain airflow. Many strollers feature mesh panels for ventilation, but ensure there are no gaps large enough for your cat to squeeze through. 


### Straps and Securement

Look for strollers with adjustable straps that secure your cat in place during movement. The straps should prevent your cat from sliding around or leaning out of the stroller. Some strollers incorporate a harness system for additional stability and safety.

Most cat strollers have features that enhance your pet's safety and enjoyment, such as padded handles, adjustable harnesses, and roomy interiors. Some models also include built-in scratch panels and nap pouches to accommodate your cat's natural behaviors. 


### What are the benefits of a cat stroller?

A cat stroller provides a practical solution for transporting your pet while allowing you to maintain your usual activities. It's ideal for short trips, errands, or travel when carrying a carrier in the car is inconvenient. 

The stroller's design helps prevent stress-related behavior in cats by providing easy access to your presence while maintaining a secure environment. It's especially beneficial for cats who may not tolerate traditional carriers well or who need assistance moving between locations.

### How should I care for my cat stroller?

Clean the stroller after each use to maintain hygiene and prevent odors, following the manufacturer's recommendations for cleaning materials and methods. 

Regularly check the stroller for wear and tear, ensuring all components, including wheels and locks, function properly before each use. 


### Can I use a standard stroller for my cat?

While some cats might tolerate a standard stroller, it's generally not recommended due to safety and comfort concerns. Standard strollers lack features specific to cat carriers, such as secure lids and adjustable harnesses.
