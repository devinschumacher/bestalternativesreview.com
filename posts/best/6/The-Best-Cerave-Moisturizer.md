## Buyer's Guide

Cerave Moisturizers represent a significant advancement in skincare, particularly for those with sensitive or dry skin. These products combine ceramides, fatty acids, and niacinamide to repair and strengthen the skin barrier, making them highly effective for daily use. 


### Key Ingredients and Their Benefits

Ceramides form a protective barrier on the skin surface, helping to retain moisture and prevent transepidermal water loss. Fatty acids, such as squalane and ceramide-3, create a protective film that locks in moisture and seals in hydration. Niacinamide enhances skin elasticity and helps maintain healthy skin pH levels by regulating oil production. 


### Formulations and Usage

The original Cerave Moisturizing Cream is suitable for normal to dry skin types, while the PM Formula includes soothing ingredients like Pruritcalm Complex, making it ideal for nighttime use. The Daily Moisturizing Lotion is lighter and more suitable for oily or combination skin types, while the Fragrance-Free version is suitable for those with sensitive skin. 


### Application and Integration

Apply a small amount to clean, dry skin, gently massaging until fully absorbed. For best results, use twice daily (AM and PM) as the final step in your skincare routine, followed by sunscreen during the day. The product can be used alone or layered with other Cerave products, including the Hydroactive Moisturizer for extra hydration. 


### Considerations and Tips

While Cerave Moisturizers are generally well-tolerated, spot testing is recommended to ensure compatibility, especially before daily use. Those with severe eczema or dryness may require additional treatments like steroid creams or intense hydration therapy under medical supervision. Store products in a cool place away from direct sunlight to maintain efficacy. 


## FAQ


### What is the difference between Cerave Moisturizing Cream and Lotion?

Cerave Moisturizing Cream provides intense hydration for dry, irritated skin, while the Lotion offers a thinner consistency suitable for everyday use on normal to oily skin types. 

The Cream contains ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and fatty acids to restore the skin's barrier function and reduce redness. The Lotion includes these same ingredients in a lighter formula that absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue. 


### Is Cerave Moisturizing Cream suitable for sensitive skin?

Yes, Cerave Moisturizing Cream is fragrance-free and hypoallergenic, making it suitable for sensitive skin types. It's dermatologist-tested and formulated with three essential ceramides to help maintain skin's barrier function. 

The product is also non-comedogenic, meaning it won't clog pores, making it appropriate for those with acne-prone or sensitive skin conditions. 


### Which Cerave Moisturizer should I use if my skin is extremely dry?

If your skin is extremely dry and experiences flakiness, thick scaling, or rawness, the Cerave Moisturizing Cream is the most suitable product. It provides intense hydration and helps repair damaged skin barrier. 

For less severe dryness or daily use on normal to dry skin, consider the Cerave Moisturizing Lotion, which still delivers robust hydration in a more lightweight formula. 


### How should I use Cerave Moisturizing Cream?

Apply Cerave Moisturizing Cream to the face and neck immediately after cleansing and toning in the morning and evening. Gently massage until fully absorbed. 

For best results, use the product daily as part of your regular skincare routine. 


### Are there any specific skin conditions that should avoid Cerave Moisturizers?

If you have open wounds, blisters, or severe irritation on your skin, you should avoid using Cerave Moisturizers until the condition improves. 

Users with active acne lesions should wait until the skin has healed before incorporating Cerave moisturizers into their routine, as these products may not be appropriate for active breakouts. 


### What ingredients in Cerave Moisturizers make them effective?

The key ingredients include three essential ceramides (1, 3, and 6-II) that support the skin's natural barrier function, as well as niacinamide (vitamin B3) which helps reduce transepidermal water loss. 

Additional moisturizing agents like hyaluronic acid and free fatty acids work synergistically to lock in moisture and maintain skin hydration throughout the day.
