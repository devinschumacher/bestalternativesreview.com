## Buyer's Guide

Criterion Refrigerators combine advanced cooling technology with elegant design, making them a popular choice for modern kitchens. Understanding the key features and considerations can help you select the right model that meets your storage needs while fitting your style preferences. 


### Capacity and Configuration

Select a refrigerator with enough capacity to suit your family size and food storage habits. Consider multi-zone cooling options that allow different temperature settings for various food types. Built-in options offer seamless integration with your existing cabinetry, while standalone models provide flexibility in placement.

Smart refrigerators offer additional functionality like app connectivity, recipe storage, and built-in cameras. Consider how these features align with your technology preferences and practical needs.

Elegance and quality materials characterize Criterion's design aesthetic. The door design affects both appearance and functionality; French-door models provide efficient space utilization, while side-by-side designs offer easy access. Installation considerations include space requirements, door swing clearance, and water connections for ice and water dispensers.
