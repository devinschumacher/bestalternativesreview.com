## FAQ


### What makes the Razer Basilisk different from other gaming mice?

The Razer Basilisk stands out from traditional gaming mice through its advanced sensor technology and ergonomic design. Equipped with the Razer Optic Sensor 5000, it offers exceptional precision with a 12,000 CPI and 200 IPS tracking speed, while its wireless connectivity via Razer HyperSpeed ensures latency-free gaming. 

Its unique curved shape and extended side grips enhance both comfort and control during extended gaming sessions. The mouse's 11 programmable buttons and customizable RGB lighting further differentiate it from competitors in the same category. 


### How does the Razer Basilisk's wireless connectivity compare to wired options?

Through Razer HyperSpeed wireless technology, the Basilisk provides a consistent 1ms latency comparable to wired connections while maintaining up to 18 months of battery life on a single charge. The mouse automatically switches between 2.4G wireless and USB pass-through modes based on system compatibility and usage. 

Users can choose between three different connection profiles - 1ms gaming mode, standard mode, and power-saving mode - to optimize performance based on their specific use case. 


### What are the key features of Razer's SpeedFlex cable?

The SpeedFlex cable used in the Razer Basilisk features ultra-lightweight construction and a flexible profile that eliminates cable tangling and movement interference during gameplay. At just 75g, it's approximately 30% lighter than standard gaming cables, reducing fatigue during extended sessions. 

The cable includes a braided interior core that prevents stretching and retains its shape, while the external jacket resists wear from movement and prevents tangling. It's compatible with both left- and right-handed users and available in multiple lengths (1m, 2m, and 3m). 


### How does the Razer Basilisk's 2.4G wireless range perform?

The Razer Basilisk's 2.4G wireless system maintains stable connections up to 10 meters (33 feet) from the receiver in open spaces, with reduced performance slightly beyond 15 meters (49 feet). Obstacles like walls and furniture can affect range and signal strength. 

Users can improve wireless performance by positioning the receiver in an open area, keeping the cable straight, and avoiding interference from other wireless devices. The mouse automatically reconnects if the signal drops below a certain threshold. 


### What are the different RGB lighting modes available?

The Razer Basilisk offers six RGB lighting modes: Razer Chroma RGB, Rainbow, Pulse, Strobe, Breathing, and Custom. The Razer Chroma RGB mode allows full-color customization and animated effects, while the other modes offer more basic color cycling and patterns. 

Users can synchronize the lighting with other Razer devices via the Razer Synapse software, which also enables full customization of button functions and profiles. The RGB lighting remains active on a low 10% battery charge, with automatic dimming at 5% charge. 


### What are the system requirements for using the Razer Basilisk?

Basic functionality requires no specific system requirements, but optimal performance benefits from a modern operating system. The mouse works with Windows 10/11 and macOS 10.14 or later, with full compatibility and features requiring Razer Synapse 3.0 or later. 

For wireless functionality, the USB receiver should be connected to a USB 2.0 port with at least 500mA power delivery. The mouse also works with laptops, tablets, and Chromebook devices running compatible operating systems.
