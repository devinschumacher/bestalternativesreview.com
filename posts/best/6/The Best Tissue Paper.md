## Buyer's Guide

Tissue paper serves a variety of household and commercial purposes, from bathroom tissue to gift wrapping. When selecting tissue paper, consider factors such as thickness, absorbency, and special features like textured surfaces or scents. 


### Key Features of Tissue Paper

![Tissue-Paper-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Tissue-Paper-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)

Standard tissue paper is typically 2-ply, meaning it consists of two layers of paper bonded together for strength and durability. Higher-quality options may offer 3-ply construction. The thickness of the tissue affects both its cost and performance: thicker tissue provides more luxurious feel and better absorbing power but at a higher price point. 

Specialty tissues often include additional features like increased absorbency, textured surfaces for better grip, or pleasant scents. These enhancements can improve usability and enhance the user experience, making them worth the slightly higher cost for specific applications. 


### Considerations for Commercial Use

Organizations choosing tissue paper for commercial applications should consider factors beyond basic functionality. Businesses with high traffic may need bulkier rolls or automatic dispensers to maintain supply. For healthcare facilities, the priority shifts to infection control standards and proper disposal methods. 

Incorporating eco-friendly options through recycled content or biodegradable materials aligns with environmental initiatives while maintaining functionality. The location of use also influences choice, with outdoor applications requiring more resistant materials than indoor use.

### Bathroom Tissue Requirements

Bathroom tissue selection focuses heavily on core performance metrics: softness, strength, and waste reduction. Premium options often include lotion-infused formulas or ultra-thin construction that delivers fewer tears and more usable sheets per roll. 

Storage and dispensing systems significantly impact user satisfaction. Roll diameter affects how quickly tissues become difficult to reach, while dispenser design influences both ease of use and hygiene standards. Some businesses opt for single-ply systems to reduce waste while maintaining comparable performance to standard 2-ply options. 


## FAQ

![Tissue-Paper-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Tissue-Paper-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the differences between facial tissue and toilet paper?

Facial tissue is designed for gentle cleaning and moisture absorption, with finer fibers that make it softer than standard toilet paper. It's typically more expensive and comes in various scented options. 

Toilet paper is more durable for cleaning but less soft. Unscented varieties are common, and it's generally more affordable than facial tissue. 

![Tissue-Paper-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Tissue-Paper-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How should I store my tissue paper?

Store in a cool, dry place to prevent soft tissues from drying out or biodegradable options from breaking down. 

Airtight containers or sealed bags protect the paper from air exposure, maintaining its quality and preventing dust accumulation. 


### What are biodegradable tissues made from?

![tissue-paper-1](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tissue-paper-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)

Biodegradable tissues are often made from unbleached paper, certified sustainable wood pulp, or plant-based materials like bamboo or cornstems. 

These materials break down more readily in compost conditions but still retain their cleaning properties before degradation begins. 


### How many layers does a typical tissue paper have?

Most standard tissues have a single ply construction, offering a delicate texture and reduced bulk. 

Double-ply tissues consist of two layers bonded together, providing greater strength and better moisture absorption while staying relatively thin. 


### Are all tissues suitable for home composting?

Uncoated, unbleached single-ply tissues can often be composted at home, but biodegradable varieties may decompose more effectively. 

Check product packaging for composting instructions, as some biodegradable options require industrial composting facilities


### What's the shelf life of unopened tissue paper?

Unopened packages of tissue paper typically have a 2-year shelf life when stored properly in a dry environment. 

After opening, it's best to use the tissues within 6 months to maintain quality and prevent moisture-related damage.
