These black leather platform sandals combine a retro slingback design with a substantial block heel, creating a charming yet practical warm-weather shoe that's surprisingly comfortable for all-day wear. The soft leather upper provides an elegant base for the 2.5-inch heel and 1-inch platform, though users note the shoe can feel stiff and lacks flexibility.

These lightweight platform sandals from Wild Fable pair a contoured footbed with a double-strap design that can be customized with adjustable buckles.

These black platform sandals check the right boxes with their adjustable straps and comfortable Travel Lite construction, but unfortunately fall short in execution with cheap materials and poor detailing.

## Buyer's Guide

Strappy platform sandals combine elevated height with intricate detailing, making them a popular choice for both casual and formal occasions. These stylish footwear options require careful consideration of several key factors to ensure a comfortable and stylish addition to your wardrobe. 


### Heel Height and Stability

The platform height significantly affects both comfort and walking stability. Standard heel heights range from 2 to 5 inches, with higher platforms emphasizing a more dramatic effect but requiring greater balance. Look for models with a stable heel base and a generous platform surface to enhance both safety and style.

### Strap Design and Support

The strap configuration provides essential foot support while maintaining aesthetic appeal. Cross-over straps offer better arch support and prevent slipping, while thinner straps can create a sleeker appearance. Ensure straps are seated comfortably around the foot without being too tight, which can restrict blood flow. 


### MATERIALS AND COMFORT

High-quality leather or synthetic materials provide durability and breathability, crucial for all-day wear. The insole quality determines foot comfort, so opt for models with cushioned interiors or interchangeable insoles. Slip-resistant soles are essential for safety, especially on polished floor surfaces.

### CARE AND MAINTENANCE

Regular cleaning and proper storage extend the lifespan of your platform sandals. Use a soft cloth and mild soap for daily cleaning, and avoid exposing the shoes to direct sunlight or extreme temperatures. Consider purchasing a shoe horn for easy entry and maintaining the sandal's shape during storage. 


## FAQ

![Strappy-Platform-Sandals-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Strappy-Platform-Sandals-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the main materials used in strappy platform sandals?

The primary materials in platform sandals include synthetic leather, genuine leather, and occasionally canvas for more casual styles. Synthetic leather and faux materials are popular due to their affordability and water resistance. 

Higher-end models often feature genuine leather construction, while some sport a canvas upper for breathability. The straps are commonly made from the same material as the upper or sometimes from elastic for easier wear. 


### How do you properly care for platform sandals?

Regular maintenance involves wiping the surface with a damp cloth to remove dirt and dust. For synthetic materials, use a mild soap solution, while leathers require a specifically formulated leather cleaner. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials that can damage the finish. 

Always allow the sandals to dry naturally before wearing. Store them in a dust bag when not in use to protect the surface and maintain their shape. 

![Strappy-Platform-Sandals-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Strappy-Platform-Sandals-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What sizes and measurements should I consider when selecting platform sandals?

When measuring your feet for platform sandals, measure your foot length from heel to longest toe and add 1/2 to 1 inch for a comfortable fit. Allow for some extra space if you plan to wear them with thicker socks or hosiery. 

Check the specific manufacturer's size guide, as many brands offer different levels of comfort and roominess. Wide fitting options are available, particularly in the toe box, to accommodate various foot shapes. 


### How high are platform sandals typically, and what's the minimum safe height?

Platform sandals range from 1.5 to 8 inches in height, depending on the design and style. The minimum safe height for platform sandals is typically 1.5 inches, as this offers a good balance of height and stability. 

Heights above 3 inches increase the risk of tripping and instability, especially for longer strides or uneven surfaces. Consider your walking style and environment when selecting a height.

### What styles of clothing pair best with platform sandals?

Platform sandals work well with casual and dressy outfits. For casual looks, pair them with jeans, shorts, or skirts. More formal occasions can accommodate them with dresses, maxis, or formal pantsuit ensembles. 

The design elements of the sandals will influence their versatility. Chunky platforms with gemstone embellishments work well with eveningwear, while sleek metallic designs pair beautifully with contemporary dresses. 


### How do I maintain the shape of my platform sandals?

To maintain the shape of your platform sandals, avoid leaving them in direct sunlight or extreme temperatures, as this can cause the materials to distort. Use a foot-shaped form inside the sandals when storing them to help maintain their shape. 

When not in use, place a piece of cardboard or shape-retention insert inside the sandals to keep the arches and heel structure supported. This helps prevent the straps from sagging and maintain the overall shape of the footwear.
