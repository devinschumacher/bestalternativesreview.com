## Buyer's Guide

Native deodorants represent an increasingly popular alternative to traditional antiperspirants and deodorants. These natural products offer a range of benefits, from reduced chemical exposure to potential skin health improvements, making them worth considering for anyone seeking a more natural personal care routine. 


### Active Ingredients and Their Effects

Most native deodorants contain natural ingredients with antimicrobial or odor-neutralizing properties. Common active ingredients include baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), which helps control moisture and odor; baking powder (a combination of baking soda and cornstarch), which provides similar benefits while controlling pH levels; and essential oils, which offer natural odor protection and potential skin-soothing properties. Each ingredient brings specific benefits, so understanding their effects can help you choose the right product for your needs. 


### Skin Compatibility and Sensitivity

Skin sensitivity is a critical factor when selecting a native deodorant. While these products are generally less harsh than traditional deodorants, they still contain active ingredients that might cause irritation, especially for sensitive skin types. Look for products specifically labeled as hypoallergenic or fragrance-free, and consider doing a patch test on a small area before full-body application to check for any adverse reactions. 


### Application and Usage

The application process for native deodorants closely mirrors that of traditional products, but results can vary. Because these deodorants don't contain harsh chemicals that temporarily block sweat glands, they might not provide lasting protection throughout the day. Reapplication mid-day may be necessary for full effectiveness. Additionally, native deodorants typically work better when applied to dry skin, so timing your application to match your shower routine can enhance their performance. 


### Environmental Impact and Packaging

Sustainability is a key advantage of native deodorants. Many brands use biodegradable packaging made from materials like aluminum, cardboard, or paper, reducing plastic waste. The natural ingredients also decompose more readily than synthetic chemicals. However, the environmental impact varies based on the specific brand's production processes and ingredient sourcing. Choosing a product with certified sustainable packaging and eco-friendly manufacturing practices can further minimize your environmental footprint. 


## FAQ


### What makes Native deodorants natural?

Our deodorants are made from a blend of natural ingredients including baking soda, arrowroot powder, and essential oils. We avoid harsh chemicals and synthetic fragrances to create products that are natural and effective. 

You can feel good about using Native deodorants knowing they're free from parabens, phthalates, aluminum, and other artificial additives commonly found in conventional deodorants. 


### Are Native deodorants effective?

Our triple-action formula helps control wetness, mask odors, and fight bacteria that causes body odor. Most customers report lasting protection throughout the day without the harsh metallic taste or strong chemical smell. 

That said, effectiveness can vary slightly based on individual body chemistry, diet, and sweat levels. If you're concerned, we recommend testing with our travel-sized samples first. 


### How do I apply Native deodorant?

Scoop a dime-sized amount onto your fingertip and massage it onto clean underarms. The natural ingredients work best when applied directly to dry skin, so wait a few minutes after showering to apply. 

For stubborn body odors, you can apply a bit more and add a touch of our natural deodorant spray to freshen throughout the day. 


### Do Native deodorants cause irritation?

Our hypoallergenic formula is less likely to cause irritation than conventional deodorants, but any new product can take some time to adjust to. Start by applying less at first and gradually increase. 

If you experience redness, itching, or burning, discontinue use and consult with a dermatologist. We recommend patch testing a small amount on your inner wrist for 24 hours before full application. 


### What fragrance options are available?

We offer three signature scents: Original (unflavored), Citrus, and Lavender. The Original formula has a subtle scent, while Citrus provides a fresh, zesty fragrance. Lavender offers a relaxing botanical scent. 

Each fragrance contains 100% natural essential oils and is carefully balanced to complement the natural ingredients without overpowering them. 


### How long do Native deodorants last?

Our deodorants last about 3-6 months with daily use, depending on personal application amount and frequency. The natural formula and lack of propellants make them more sensitive to temperature changes. 

Store your deodorant at room temperature away from direct sunlight to maintain its effectiveness. If you notice a change in texture or scent, it's time to replace it.
