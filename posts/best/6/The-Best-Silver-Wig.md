## FAQ


### What is a silver wig?

A silver wig is a hairpiece designed to appear as if the wearer's hair has turned gray or white. They are made from synthetic or human hair and styled to look natural or dramatic, depending on the desired effect. 

These wigs often feature multiple layers and carefully constructed roots to achieve the appearance of realistic silver hair with natural-looking growth patterns. 


### How do I care for a silver wig?

Most silver wigs are lightweight and can be maintained with minimal care. Regular brushing with a boar bristle brush helps distribute natural oils and prevent tangling. The wig should be air-dried after styling rather than being heat-styled. 

Proper storage is crucial to maintain the wig's shape. When not in use, place it on a padded wig stand or roll it in a clean towel to prevent compression damage. 


### What hair texture options are available?

Silver wigs come in various textures, from fine and wavy to thick and straight. The texture can range from natural-looking grays to stark white, depending on the product's intended style. 

Some wigs offer multiple parts where different textures can be applied, allowing for more natural-looking blends with existing hair color. 


### Can I dye a silver wig?

Most synthetic silver wigs can be safely dyed with special wig-friendly hair dye, while human hair wigs may require professional touch-ups to maintain their quality. Always test dye on a small section first to check for color compatibility. 

When dyeing, avoid harsh chemicals and opt for products specifically designed for hair extensions and wigs. Rinse the wig thoroughly after dyeing to remove any excess color. 


### How long do silver wigs typically last?

Synthetic silver wigs typically last 6-12 months with regular care before needing replacement. Human hair wigs can last longer, sometimes 2-3 years, depending on how frequently they are worn and how well they are cared for. 

The frequency of grooming and styling sessions impacts the wig's lifespan. Regular maintenance and proper storage significantly extend its usable life. 


### What size range do silver wigs come in?

Silver wigs are available in various sizes to accommodate different head circumferences. Most wigs come in standard sizes S, M, L, and XL, with some manufacturers offering additional options for smaller or larger heads. 

If you struggle with finding the right size, consider purchasing a wig with adjustable straps or opting for one with a larger circumference to ensure comfortable, secure wear.
