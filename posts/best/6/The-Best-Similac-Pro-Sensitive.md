## Buyer's Guide

Similac Pro Sensitive formula is designed to support babies with sensitive digestive systems, offering a blend of prebiotics and reduced lactose content. When considering this product, there are several key factors to evaluate to ensure you choose the right formula for your sensitive baby. 


### Prebiotic Content

Look for formulas with GOS (Galactooligosaccharides) prebiotics, which help promote the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut. This can aid digestion and reduce the occurrences of colic and constipation, common issues in sensitive infants. 


### Lactose Reduction

Similac Pro Sensitive contains partially hydrolyzed protein, which breaks down some of the lactose in the formula. This modification can make it easier for babies with slightly more sensitive digestive systems to tolerate, compared to standard formulas. 


### Additional Nutritional Factors

While focusing on lactose reduction and prebiotics, also consider other nutritional aspects. Essential nutrients like iron, DHA, and choline support overall baby development. Make sure the formula you choose meets these nutritional requirements for optimal growth and development. 


### Consultation with Healthcare Provider

Before switching formulas, especially for babies with sensitive digestive systems, consult with your pediatrician. They can provide guidance based on your baby's specific needs and help determine if Similac Pro Sensitive or another formula would be most appropriate.
