## Buyer's Guide

Fangor projectors offer an engaging way to enhance your viewing experience with clear, vibrant images. Understanding key features will help you select the right projector for your needs. 


### Resolution and Picture Quality

The projector's resolution determines picture clarity. Common resolutions include 720p, 1080p, and 4K. Higher resolutions provide sharper, more detailed images. Additionally, consider the projector's contrast ratio and brightness for better picture quality in various viewing environments. 


### Luminosity and Lighting Requirements

Luminosity, measured in ANSI lumens, affects how clearly the image appears in different light conditions. For dark rooms, a projector with 3000 lumens or less may be sufficient. In well-lit rooms, choose a projector with 3500 lumens or more to maintain image visibility. 


### Throw Ratio and Screen Size

The throw ratio indicates how far the projector needs to be from the screen to project a specific size image. Short throw projectors (1.2x or less) are ideal for small rooms or mounting, while long throw projectors (1.5x or more) are suitable for larger spaces. 


### Connectivity Options

Projectors with multiple connectivity options, including HDMI, USB, and Wi-Fi, provide flexibility for various content sources. Consider whether you need wireless capabilities, additional ports for external devices, or built-in speakers for complete audio solutions. 


## FAQ


### Does the Fangor Projector support 4K resolution?

The Fangor Projector supports 4K resolution through its HDR 10 compatibility. It processes 4K content by scaling 1080p inputs to 4K, though native 4K playback requires compatible media. 

For optimal 4K performance, connect directly to the projector via HDMI 2.0 cables from 4K sources. The projector's native resolution is 3840x2160, and it handles 4K content through upscaling rather than native display. 


### How does the Fangor Projector's brightness compare to other models in its class?

The Fangor Projector offers a typical brightness of 2200 ANSI lumens, which places it in the mid-range for projectors in its class. This brightness level works well for home theater environments with moderate lighting and up to 20-25 feet of screen distance. 

When compared to similar models, the Fangor matches or exceeds many competitors in the same category, making it suitable for most home theater setups without the need for extremely dark conditions. 


### What connectivity options does the Fangor Projector offer?

The Fangor Projector includes three HDMI 2.0 ports, one USB type-C port, one USB 2.0 port, and an Ethernet port for internet connectivity. The HDMI ports support up to 4K at 60Hz, while the USB-C port enables both data transfer and USB-Powered charging for the remote control. 

Additional features include voice control compatibility, DLNA for streaming from network-attached storage devices, and Miracast for wireless screen mirroring from smartphones and tablets. 


### How much maintenance does the Fangor Projector require?

The Fangor Projector requires minimal maintenance, with a filter cleaning schedule recommended every 1000 hours of use. The lamp lasts up to 10,000 hours in Eco mode, reducing the need for frequent bulb replacements. 

Regular cleaning of the exterior and lens keeps the projector performing optimally. The projector also features cool-start functionality, which reduces maintenance by allowing the unit to cool down before turning back on. 


### What are the main drawbacks of the Fangor Projector?

The primary drawbacks include a limited built-in speaker system, with only stereo output available. This requires additional investment in external speakers for optimal home theater experience. 

Another consideration is the cooling fan noise, which becomes noticeable at higher volumes or during extended use. While not excessively loud, some users may find the fan noise distracting in complete darkness. 


### How does the Fangor Projector compare to its predecessor, the Fangor 2?

The main improvement is in brightness, with the Fangor offering 2200 ANSI lumens compared to the Fangor 2's 2000 ANSI lumens. The updated model also includes improved HDMI 2.1 compatibility and enhanced color accuracy. 

The projector maintains the same core functionality as its predecessor, including similar connectivity options and performance specifications. The primary difference is in the hardware upgrades and feature refinements.
