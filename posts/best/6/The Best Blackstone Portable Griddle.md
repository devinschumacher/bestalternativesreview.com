## Buyer's Guide

A Blackstone portable griddle offers an affordable and versatile outdoor cooking solution, combining a large cooking surface with efficient heating. Here's what to consider when selecting the right portable griddle for your needs.

The cooking surface area determines how many people you can feed and how much food you can cook at once. Common sizes range from 12 to 22 inches in diameter. Consider whether you need to grill a couple of sandwiches or cook a full meal for a gathering.

### Heat Source and Fuel Type

Portable griddles typically use propane or charcoal as fuel sources. Propane provides consistent heat and easy ignition, while charcoal offers a traditional grilling flavor. Think about your cooking style and convenience preferences when choosing between these options. 


### Griddle Construction and Durability

The griddle surface should be made of aluminum or stainless steel for durability and even heat distribution. Look for a griddle with a raised lip around the edges to prevent food from falling off. The base should be sturdy enough to remain stable during cooking.
