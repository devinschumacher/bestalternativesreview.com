## FAQ


### What makes Doc Marten platform sandals unique?

Doc Marten platform sandals combine the brand's signature yellow stitching and AirWair cushioning with elevated, stackable soles for added height and comfort. The platforms range from 1 inch to 3 inches, offering various levels of elevation. 

These sandals feature wide, roomy toe boxes, adjustable ankle straps, and breathable mesh uppers with synthetic overlays, making them suitable for both casual wear and extended walking. 


### How do I choose the right platform height?

Consider your personal comfort level and intended use. Lower heights (1-1.5 inches) are ideal for everyday wear and short walks, while taller options (2-3 inches) are suitable for special occasions or when you want a significant height boost. 

Try on different heights to determine what feels most natural when standing and walking. Some may prefer a slightly lower platform for better balance, while others might opt for taller options for greater height increase. 


### What materials are used in Doc Marten platform sandals?

The uppers typically feature breathable mesh with synthetic overlays, providing both ventilation and support. The synthetic materials include PU and TPU, known for their durability and water resistance. 

The outsoles combine rubber and PU compounds for traction and flexibility, while the AirWair midsoles provide shock absorption through compressed air cells. 


### How should I care for my Doc Marten platform sandals?

Use a damp cloth to clean the mesh and synthetic materials regularly. For stubborn stains, you can use mild soap and water, ensuring thorough drying before wearing. 

Avoid harsh chemicals, abrasive cleaners, and excessive water exposure, as they can damage the materials and compromise the integrity of the AirWair cells. 


### What sizes are available for Doc Marten platform sandals?

Standard UK sizing is used, with men's sizes ranging from 3 to 14 and women's sizes from 3 to 9. The brand recommends ordering your regular size, as these sandals typically run true to size. 

Check the specific product page for availability in your size, as some styles may have limited UK sizing options compared to international sizes. 


### How long do Doc Marten platform sandals last?

These sandals can last 6-12 months with regular wear, depending on usage frequency and care. The lifespan can vary based on how often you wear them, the quality of care, and whether they're used for casual or formal occasions. 

Signs of wear to watch for include frayed stitching, stiffened mesh, and degraded AirWair cells. If you notice significant wear after 12 months, consider replacing the sandals for the best comfort and support.
