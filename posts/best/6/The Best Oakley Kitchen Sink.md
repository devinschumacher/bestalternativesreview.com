## Buyer's Guide

An Oakley kitchen sink combines durability, functionality, and style, making it a significant investment in your kitchen's performance. Understanding key features will help you select a sink that matches your needs and enhances your kitchen's aesthetics. 


### Size and Shape

Common sizes range from 16 to 24 inches in length and 9 to 13 inches in depth. Consider your kitchen's workflow, counter space, and refrigerator height when choosing dimensions. Shapes include single-basin, double-basin, and farmhouse styles, each affecting installation and maintenance requirements. 


### Metal Construction

The sink's metal blend typically consists of 18-gauge 18-8 stainless steel, with some premium models featuring 24-gauge or thicker materials. Greater gauge numbers indicate thinner, more flexible sinks that scratch more easily. Look for premium blends that maximize corrosion resistance while maintaining durability. 


### Coatings and Finishes

The standard brushed stainless finish offers excellent corrosion resistance and durability. For enhanced protection against scratches and corrosion, consider sinks with protective PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) coatings. These finishes maintain the metal's durability while adding a sleek, modern appearance. 


### Acoustic Features

Modern Oakley sinks incorporate proprietary acoustic technologies to reduce water noise and isolate vibrations. These features can significantly improve the kitchen's overall ambiance, making them particularly valuable in open-plan or shared spaces. 


## FAQ


### What are Oakley kitchen sinks made from?

Oakley offers sinks in two primary materials: stainless steel and acrylic. Their stainless steel sinks feature a 16-gauge construction with a brushed or matte finish. Acrylic sinks provide a more affordable option while still delivering durability and aesthetic appeal. 

Both materials undergo rigorous testing to ensure scratch resistance and longevity. The stainless steel models resist water spots and maintain their finish over time, while acrylic provides better impact resistance and is easier to repair if damaged. 


### How do I choose between an acrylic and stainless steel sink?

Acrylic sinks are ideal for budget-conscious buyers or those who value a more traditional sink appearance. They resist stains and are highly impact-resistant, making them suitable for high-traffic kitchen environments. 

Stainless steel sinks offer superior durability and a modern look. They resist water spots and maintain their shine with regular care. These sinks are recommended for homeowners who appreciate the premium appearance and long-term investment value. 


### What sink sizes are available?

Oakley offers sink sizes ranging from single bowls measuring 20-22 inches in diameter to double bowl configurations with individual bowls measuring 18-20 inches. Their largest single bowl model measures 28 inches in diameter, suitable for double bowl installations. 

The company's design flexibility allows customization of sink configurations, including drop-in, farmhouse, and undermount installations. Each size option balances space efficiency with practical functionality for kitchen design. 


### How do I care for my Oakley sink?

Regular maintenance keeps your Oakley sink looking its best. For stainless steel, use mild soap and warm water, followed by a soft cloth to prevent water spots. Avoid abrasive cleaners and steel wool, which can scratch the surface. 

Acrylic requires minimal care. Use household cleaners for daily maintenance, but avoid harsh chemicals that can damage the surface. Always wash with a soft cloth to prevent scratches and streaks. 


### What's included with the sink purchase?

Standard purchases include the sink body, drain assembly, and a stopper for the drain opening. Additional components like soap dishes, built-in baskets, or secondary drain kits may be available as optional accessories. 

Installation hardware and instructions are included for both stainless steel and acrylic models. The completeness of the package ensures all necessary components are provided for proper sink functionality. 


### Can I get the sink in a different finish?

For stainless steel models, Oakley offers a choice between brushed and matte finish options. These finishes are applied directly to the sink surface during manufacturing. 

Acrylic sinks are only available in white or a similar neutral color. Customizing the color or finish is not an option for these models, but they can be paired with complementary stone or engineered countertops to enhance kitchen design.
