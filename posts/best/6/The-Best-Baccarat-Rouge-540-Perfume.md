## FAQ


### What is Baccarat Rouge 540?

Baccarat Rouge 540 is a women's fragrance created by Baccarat, a prestigious French crystal house. The perfume combines traditional distillation techniques with modern fragrance chemistry, featuring a heady blend of rose, jasmine, and saffron. 

Released in 2008, the fragrance has become a signature scent for Baccarat, combining their expertise in crystal with aromatic complexity. 


### What makes Baccarat Rouge 540 unique?

Unlike many contemporary fragrances, Baccarat Rouge 540 is distilled at room temperature to preserve the purity of its ingredients. This method, combined with the use of whole flower distillation, results in a rich, multifaceted scent profile. 

The perfume's formulation includes rare and expensive notes like saffron and osmanthus, which are typically difficult to work with in modern fragrances due to their strong character and volatility. 


### What is the scent like?

Baccarat Rouge 540 opens with intense, almost medicinal white pepper followed by layers of fresh-cut roses. The heart note of jasmine saffron adds warmth and complexity, while the base combines rich vanilla with subtle smoky undertones from the saffron. 

The fragrance evolves over time, developing additional notes of bergamot and honeyed almond, creating a long-lasting and evolving olfactory experience. 


### How does it compare to other Baccarat fragrances?

While Baccarat offers several other fragrance lines, including Baccarat Crystal and Baccarat White Musk, Rouge 540 stands out with its higher concentration of natural ingredients and more complex composition. 

Compared to Baccarat's other releases, Rouge 540 has a more pronounced oriental influence, drawing clear inspiration from Middle Eastern spices and flowers. 


### What type of bottle design does it come in?

The perfume bottle features Baccarat's signature crystal craftsmanship, with a deep rose-gold hue created through a centuries-old technique known as émail de boiste. The bottle's shape resembles a crushed crystal decanter, playing on Baccarat's crystal heritage. 

The cap is made of rose-gold plated metal, with the distinctive Baccarat logo engraved on the side, maintaining the brand's signature attention to detail. 


### How long does it last on the skin?

The perfume has good longevity, lasting about 6-8 hours with moderate sillage. The fresh opening notes dissipate quickly, making it suitable for daytime wear, while the heart and base notes develop a stronger projection over time. 

Reapplication is recommended every 2-3 hours for optimal lasting power, especially in warmer climates where perspiration can affect fragrance longevity.
