## Buyer's Guide

Bissell Little Green Proheat models represent a popular category of steam cleaning systems designed for home maintenance. These machines use hot water extraction technology to clean carpets, upholstery, and various household surfaces effectively. 


### Steam Cleaning Technology

These units generate high-pressure steam through boiling water, typically drawing from a removable water tank. The temperature usually ranges between 200° to 250°F, which is hot enough to kill many bacteria and allergens. 

Pay attention to the steam output and dwell time settings. Higher output means faster cleaning, but dwell time controls allow targeted cleaning of tough stains by keeping the steam in contact with the surface longer. 


### Cleaning Accessories

The variety and quality of cleaning heads and tools included can significantly affect your cleaning versatility. Essential accessories often include carpet brushes, upholstery attachments, and crevice tools for tight spaces. 

Consider swivel-head options for easier maneuvering and non-slip grips for better control during deep cleaning tasks. 


### Water Tank Capacity

The amount of water the machine holds affects the runtime and your cleaning efficiency. Larger tanks reduce interruptions for refilling, but note that more water usually means higher weight and bulk. 

Think about how frequently you'll use the machine and choose a capacity that balances convenience with practical limits. 


### Cost vs. Features

Entry-level models offer basic functionality at lower prices, while premium options include advanced features like additional steaming modes or improved water tanks. Consider your cleaning needs and how often you'll use the machine to determine where to allocate your budget. 

Look for value-added features like automatic shutoff for safety, easy-to-clean parts for maintenance, and clear instructions for optimal performance. 


## FAQ


### What is the Bissell Little Green Proheat?

The Bissell Little Green Proheat is a compact steam cleaner that attaches to your toilet bowl brush. It heats water to create steam, helping to loosen and remove dirt and grime from shower curtains, tiles, and bathroom fixtures. 

The product consists of a steam wand that attaches to any standard toilet bowl brush, a power cord for heating, and a steam wand holder. It's designed for quick cleaning jobs around the bathroom. 


### How does the Bissell Little Green Proheat work?

Water flows through the steam wand and is heated to approximately 212°F (100°C) when activated. The steam wand is designed to direct the hot steam in a targeted manner to effectively break down tough dirt and kill bacteria on surfaces. 

The heating process takes about two minutes after the wand is activated. Once preheated, the steam output continues for about 60 seconds, providing ample time to clean small areas before needing to recharge. 


### What surfaces can the Bissell Little Green Proheat clean?

The steam cleaner is effective on various surfaces including bathroom tiles, shower curtains, toilet bowls, and various bathroom fixtures. It's particularly useful for cleaning mineral buildup, soap scum, and mold. 

For best results, avoid using the steam wand on fabrics or surfaces that could be damaged by direct heat. Always test on an inconspicuous area first. 


### How difficult is it to use?

Using the Bissell Little Green Proheat is generally straightforward. The steam wand attaches easily to standard toilet bowl brushes, and the heating process is automatic once activated. 

While the cleaning process itself is simple, proper technique is important for optimal results. Hold the wand at a 45-degree angle to the surface, and move it in a controlled, steady motion for the best steam application. 


### How long does it take to clean with the Bissell Little Green Proheat?

Since each cleaning cycle lasts about 60 seconds, you'll need to move the wand from section to section to cover larger areas. For quick touch-ups, it's ideal for targeted cleaning in minutes. 

For thorough cleaning of a typical toilet bowl, expect to spend about 10 minutes. Cleaning other surfaces will depend on their size and the amount of buildup present. 


### How do I maintain the Bissell Little Green Proheat?

The steam wand can be cleaned after each use by wiping it down with a damp cloth. Always ensure it's completely dry before storing to prevent mineral buildup. 

To maintain best performance, check the heating element for debris and ensure the wand connects securely to the power cord. The unit should be plugged in and left to cool completely between uses.
