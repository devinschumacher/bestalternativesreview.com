### Design Considerations

Look for models with moisture-wicking properties to keep your feet dry during hikes and other outdoor activities. The sock's fit is crucial; they should feel snug but not restrict blood flow or movement. 

The length of the sock affects its suitability for different activities. Ankle-length socks are ideal for walking and light hiking, while longer options provide better protection for backpacking and mountaineering trips. 


### Care Requirements

Machine wash Muk Luks socks in cold water using mild detergent to maintain their shape and prevent shrinkage. Avoid using bleach or fabric softeners, which can damage the wool material. 

These socks typically require air drying rather than being placed in a dryer. Storing them in a cool, dry place helps prevent odors and extends their lifespan.

### Performance Factors

Foot shape and size influence how well Muk Luks socks perform. Those with wide feet may need to try different sizes to find a properly fitting pair. Proper venting helps prevent hot spots and blisters during extended wear. 

The sock's elasticity affects its ability to stay in place. Higher-quality models use stretchier materials that maintain their shape even after repeated washings.
