## Buyer's Guide

Lagos rings offer a practical and elegant way to display multiple Lagos watches, allowing you to showcase your collection while keeping it organized. These specialized stands feature multiple tiers or compartments designed specifically for Lagos watch models. 


### Tiered Design Considerations

The tiered structure is crucial for maximizing space while maintaining visibility. Each level should have enough clearance to prevent damage to the watches. Consider the total height and whether it will fit in your intended display space.

### Mirrored vs. Clear Display Panels

While mirrored panels protect the watches and reflect light, clear panels provide unobstructed views. The choice depends on your preference between aesthetics and protection. Make sure the display material is scratch-resistant to maintain clarity. 


### Lighting Integration

The display's built-in lighting can enhance visibility and create an impressive visual effect. LED lights are energy-efficient and provide consistent illumination. Consider whether the lighting intensity and color temperature are adjustable to suit your preferences.
