## Buyer's Guide

Taking your relaxation routine to new heights of comfort and wellness, an at-home sauna offers a steamy sanctuary where you can enjoy the therapeutic benefits of heat and humidity. Whether you're planning a small portable unit or a full-sized freestanding sauna, understanding the key features and considerations will help you find the right fit for your space and needs. 


### Size and Space Requirements

When measuring your available space, add extra room for the door, seating, and movement. Saunas typically require a minimum of 7 feet by 7 feet, with ceilings at least 7 feet 6 inches high. Consider the sauna's footprint - smaller units (60-70 inches) are easier to move around, while larger ones (80 inches and up) offer more space for lounging. 


### Heat Sources and Maintenance

The heating system is the heart of your sauna. Electric heaters are the most common, with infrared and ceramic heaters providing even heat distribution. Wood burners offer a traditional fireplace look but require regular cleaning and maintenance. Higher wattage heaters reach temperature quickly but use more electricity, while lower wattage heaters maintain consistent heat with less power consumption. 


### Seating and Comfort Features

Most saunas include a bench or seats, with higher-end models offering adjustable backrests and heated seats. Consider padded seating, adjustable height, and built-in cup holders. Saunas with separate seating areas or floating decks create zones for different activities. Some advanced models feature built-in speakers, ventilation fans, or illuminated surrounds to enhance your experience. 


### Budget and Long-term Costs

Entry-level saunas range from $300 to $1,000, while high-end units exceeding 100 inches can cost $5,000 or more. Installation may add additional costs for venting, electricity upgrades, or foundation work. Operating costs vary based on electricity rates and heater type - expect to spend $1-5 per session. Regular maintenance includes cleaning filters, checking heaters, and testing electrical components to ensure safe and efficient operation. 


## FAQ


### What are the main types of home saunas available?

Home saunas typically fall into three main categories: infrared saunas, far-infrared saunas, and traditional Finnish saunas (also known as dry saunas). Infrared saunas use infrared panels to heat objects and people rather than the air, providing a more gentle heat. Far-infrared saunas offer similar technology but with slightly longer wavelengths, potentially offering deeper penetration and greater health benefits. Traditional Finnish saunas heat the air around the user, typically reaching temperatures between 160°F and 180°F (71°C to 82°C). 

Which type of sauna is right for you depends on your specific needs and preferences. Infrared saunas are often recommended for beginners or those who prefer a more comfortable heating experience, while traditional Finnish saunas are favored by enthusiasts seeking a classic sauna experience. 


### What size sauna do I need?

The size of your sauna should be based on the number of people who will be using it regularly. As a general rule, allow approximately 12-15 square feet per person. For example, a small home sauna for two people would need about 24-30 square feet, while a larger sauna for four people would require 48-60 square feet. 

Consider additional space for benches, heating equipment, and ventilation systems when planning your sauna's dimensions. If you have limited space, infrared saunas are often a more practical option due to their efficiency in heating smaller volumes. 


### How much energy does a home sauna use?

Home saunas typically consume between 5,000 to 8,000 watts of electricity, though this can vary depending on the type of sauna and heating system. Infrared saunas generally use less energy than traditional Finnish saunas because they heat objects and people directly rather than the air. 

For comparison, a medium-sized traditional Finnish sauna might use about 4,000 watts, while an infrared sauna of similar size could use around 3,000 watts. Installing energy-efficient heating elements and choosing a sauna with good insulation can help reduce power consumption and lower operating costs. 


### What maintenance is required for home saunas?

Regular maintenance of a home sauna can vary based on the type of sauna and its specific features. In general, weekly cleaning of the heating elements and interior surfaces to prevent mineral buildup is recommended. This can be done using a solution of water and white vinegar or specialized sauna cleaners. 

Higher-maintenance tasks include checking and replacing heating elements every 3-5 years, inspecting and cleaning the ventilation system annually, and testing the electrical connections semi-annually. Infrared saunas typically require less maintenance than traditional Finnish saunas due to fewer moving parts and simpler heating systems. 


### How much space do I need around my sauna?

Proper ventilation is crucial for any home sauna, so you'll need sufficient space for fans and vents. Allow at least 3 feet of clear space around all sides of the sauna, with 6 feet recommended for optimal airflow. Additionally, there should be at least 2 feet of space between the sauna and any surrounding walls, ceilings, or other structures to ensure proper heat dissipation and ventilation. 

If you're mounting the sauna in a room with existing fixtures or obstacles, consider a wall-mounted or corner installation to maximize available space. Proper planning can help you achieve the ideal setup while minimizing the required footprint. 


### What's the difference between dry saunas and steam saunas?

Dry saunas, like traditional Finnish saunas, maintain a relatively low humidity level, usually below 20%. This results in a more intense heat experience and allows users to spend longer periods in the sauna. Temperature ranges typically fall between 160°F to 180°F (71°C to 82°C). 

Steam saunas, also known as wet saunas, maintain a higher humidity level of 60-80%. This creates a more relaxing environment with a milder heat sensation, making it a more comfortable option for beginners or those with certain health conditions. The temperature in a steam sauna typically ranges from 122°F to 140°F (50°C to 60°C).
