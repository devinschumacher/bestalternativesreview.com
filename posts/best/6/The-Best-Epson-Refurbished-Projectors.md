## Buyer's Guide

Epson refurbished projectors offer an excellent combination of value and performance. Understanding key features will help you select a model that meets your presentation needs while providing a reliable viewing experience. 


### Resolution and Picture Quality

Look for a projector with at least XGA (1024x768) resolution for clear text and images. The native resolution determines picture sharpness, with higher resolutions delivering smoother lines and finer details. Additionally, check the contrast ratio (usually measured in ANSI lumens) to ensure good black levels and color reproduction.

### Brightness and Lighting Conditions

Evaluating brightness is crucial based on your presentation environment. For daylight presentation rooms, look for projectors rated 4000 ANSI lumens or higher. In darker rooms, 2000 ANSI lumens may be sufficient, but for very dark environments, consider projectors rated 3500 ANSI lumens or higher. 


### Connectivity and Compatibility

Common connectivity options include HDMI, VGA, and USB. Consider how you'll be sourcing content - do you primarily need to connect to laptops, cameras, or streaming devices? Ensure the projector supports your preferred input types and resolutions. Some models also offer wireless connectivity, which can be handy for presenting mobile devices.

### Installation and Portability

If you need to move the projector regularly, consider its size, weight, and included accessories for transport. Fixed installation projectors are more powerful and often offer better value, while portable models provide flexibility at the cost of performance. Think about the installation requirements - do you need ceiling mount compatibility, or does the model work best on a flat surface?
