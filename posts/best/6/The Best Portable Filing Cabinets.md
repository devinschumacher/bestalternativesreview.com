## Buyer's Guide

Portable filing cabinets offer the convenience of organized storage while maintaining mobility, making them ideal for home offices, small businesses, or any space where fixed furniture isn't practical. These versatile pieces come in various sizes and materials to suit different needs and preferences. 


### Size and Capacity

Measure your available space before selecting a portable filing cabinet. Common sizes include 18-inch, 24-inch, and 36-inch options, which can accommodate different numbers of files and folders. Consider the internal dimensions when determining how many documents or folders your cabinet will need to hold, as well as the height required for comfortable access. 


### Material Quality

Premium portable filing cabinets feature steel construction with welded joints for durability and resistance to denting. The thickness of the steel ranges from 14 to 18 gauge, with thicker gauges providing better protection against bumps and drops. The surface finish should be smooth with no sharp edges to prevent damage to files. 


### Locking Mechanisms

For secure storage, especially when sensitive documents are kept, choose a filing cabinet with a reliable locking mechanism. Traditional hasps and lock plates offer basic security, while concealed locking systems provide added protection against unauthorized access. Some cabinets feature multiple locks or keyless entry options for enhanced security. 


### Wheel Systems

Portable filing cabinets with four heavy-duty caster wheels make moving the unit between rooms simple. Look for locking brake mechanisms on the wheels to prevent accidental rolling once the cabinet is in place. The wheel system should allow smooth movement on both carpeted and hard-surface floors without wobbling or tipping. 


## FAQ


### What is a portable filing cabinet?

A portable filing cabinet is a compact storage solution designed for easy movement from one location to another. These cabinets typically feature lightweight materials like aluminum or plastic and include wheels for mobility. 

Portable filing cabinets are ideal for home offices, dorm rooms, or any space where traditional furniture might be impractical. They allow you to store important documents while maintaining the flexibility to reposition your workspace as needed. 


### How much weight can a portable filing cabinet hold?

Most portable filing cabinets have a weight capacity ranging from 15 to 25 pounds per shelf. The exact capacity depends on the size of the cabinet and the distribution of weight across the shelves. 

It's important to distribute the weight evenly to maintain stability and prevent tipping. Heavy items should be placed near the bottom of the cabinet for optimal balance. 


### What materials are portable filing cabinets made from?

Portable filing cabinets are commonly made from aluminum, plastic, or a combination of these materials. Some models incorporate mild steel for added durability, especially in larger sizes. 

Aluminum cabinets are the lightest but still offer good strength-to-weight ratio. Plastic cabinets are more affordable and resistant to scratches, making them popular for smaller, budget-friendly options. 


### How do portable filing cabinets compare to traditional desk file cabinets?

Portable filing cabinets typically offer less storage capacity per unit than standard desk file cabinets but excel in mobility and space efficiency. They are designed for small to medium document storage needs. 

Traditional desk file cabinets are more robust and can handle heavier loads, but they offer limited flexibility in placement. Both types serve similar purposes, so the choice depends on your specific storage and space requirements. 


### Are portable filing cabinets secure for sensitive documents?

Basic portable filing cabinets may lack features like locks and key management systems, making them less suitable for highly sensitive or confidential documents. 

For secure document storage, consider models with locking mechanisms and secure closures. Some advanced portable cabinets incorporate alarm systems or digital locks for enhanced security. 


### How should I maintain and clean a portable filing cabinet?

Regular cleaning is essential to prevent dust buildup and maintain the condition of your portable filing cabinet. Wipe surfaces with a damp cloth and mild cleaner, avoiding harsh chemicals that might damage the finish. 

Check the wheels periodically for proper lubrication and smooth operation. Regular maintenance ensures your cabinet remains functional and aesthetically pleasing.
