## FAQ

![Vitamix-Accessories-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Vitamix-Accessories-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Which Vitamix accessories are compatible with every model?

Every Vitamix blender model includes a primary container, which is compatible with all Vitamix accessories. This includes the lids, pulse controls, and base. 

The primary container comes in standard and wide capacities, allowing you to choose the right size for your blending needs. Always ensure the accessory matches the capacity of your blender container. 


### What are the different types of Vitamix containers available?

Vitamix offers standard and wide containers. Standard containers hold 16 or 20 ounces, while wide containers hold 20 ounces. Both types are dishwasher-safe and BPA-free.

![Vitamix-Accessories-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Vitamix-Accessories-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Which Vitamix accessories require a separate purchase?

While essential accessories like lids and pulse controls are included with your blender, additional containers and programs require separate purchase. Consider your blending needs to determine which accessories are right for you. 

The Vitamix programs, like the 750 Series Programs, expand your blender's functionality with specialized recipes and settings. These are available as additional purchases or as included upgrades with some models. 


### How do I clean Vitamix accessories?

Vitamix accessories are dishwasher-safe, making cleaning quick and easy. For the blender base and lid, simply wash with mild soap and water. The primary container requires hand washing due to its complex shape. 

For tougher residue, soak containers in warm, soapy water before washing. Always dry accessories completely before storing to prevent mold and mildew growth. 

![Vitamix-Accessories-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Vitamix-Accessories-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What's the best way to store Vitamix accessories?

Store Vitamix accessories upright in a dry place, with the primary container cap on to maintain shape and prevent warping. Keep the blender base and lid in their respective storage positions to avoid damage. 

Use the included storage bag for the primary container and accessories when not in use. This protects the blender from dust and maintains its optimal blending performance. 


### How do I choose the right accessories for my Vitamix model?

Check your Vitamix model's manual to determine which accessories are included and compatible with your blender. Some newer models may have different accessory requirements. 

Consider your blending needs, recipe requirements, and storage space when selecting additional accessories. This ensures you purchase the right accessories for your specific blender model and usage patterns.
