### Size Considerations

Choose ears based on your pet's size. Small ears are suitable for cats and small dogs, while larger pets like medium and big dogs require more substantial ear covers for proper protection and warmth.

Some manufacturers incorporate scent diffusers or calming pheromones to help pets feel more secure and relaxed. 


### Care and Maintenance

Regular care keeps ears looking their best. Check for loose threads or unraveling seams during each cleaning. Consider the cleaning requirements when selecting ears, with some needing frequent washing while others are designed for occasional cleaning. 

Storage should be in a dry place to prevent mildew. Consider washable storage bags or breathable fabric storage to keep ears fresh between uses.
