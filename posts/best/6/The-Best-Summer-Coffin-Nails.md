## FAQ

![Summer-Coffin-Nails-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Summer-Coffin-Nails-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are Summer Coffin Nails?

Summer coffin nails combine the classic shape of coffin nails with a modern twist, featuring sleek, elongated tips that enhance length and definition. These nails are perfect for summer because they offer a lightweight yet striking alternative to traditional coffin nails. 

The design provides a subtle elongation of the natural nail, creating a sophisticated look that pairs well with both casual and formal summer outfits. The slightly wider base reduces breakage risks while maintaining the elegant silhouette. 


### What colors work best with Summer Coffin Nails?

Most Summer coffin nails look fantastic with sheer pastel shades, bright summer colors, or sleek transparent finishes. These nail colors complement the clean lines of the design and enhance the natural beauty of your summer look. 

Avoid heavily pigmented dark colors that might overwhelm the nail shape. Instead, choose lighter, more subtle shades that allow the elegant design to shine through.

### How long do Summer coffin nails typically last?

Professional Summer coffin nails usually last 2-3 weeks with proper care, though this can vary based on factors like nail growth rate and individual nail health. 

At-home applications typically last 2-4 weeks for most people, depending on nail health and maintenance habits. 


### Are Summer coffin nails comfortable to wear?

Many wearers report that Summer coffin nails are surprisingly comfortable, particularly when applied properly. The slightly wider base helps distribute pressure more evenly across the nail bed. 

However, some might find them slightly less comfortable than natural nails, especially during the first few days of wear as the nails adjust to their new shape.

### What nail care products are safe for Summer coffin nails?

Most quality nail care products are safe for Summer coffin nails, including nail polish removers, cuticle oils, and moisturizers. Look for products specifically designed for extended nails to ensure compatibility. 

Avoid applying thick nail polish or acrylic enhancements, as these can stress the natural nail and cause breakage. Keep the nails well-maintained and avoid harsh chemicals that might damage the natural nail bed. 


### How should I prepare my nails before getting Summer coffin nails?

Before getting Summer coffin nails, make sure your nails are clean and free of any polish or nail art. Your technician may perform a basic nail shaping and filing to prepare the nail bed for the new nail form. 

For at-home applications, thoroughly clean your nails and remove any existing polish or adhesives. Moisturize your cuticles and nails to prevent dryness and brittleness during the application process.
