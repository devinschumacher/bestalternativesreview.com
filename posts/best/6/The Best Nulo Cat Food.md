## Buyer's Guide

Choosing the right cat food can significantly impact your pet's health and well-being. Nulo offers a variety of cat food options, each with distinct features and nutritional benefits. This guide helps you understand key aspects of Nulo cat food to make an informed selection. 


### Selecting the Right Formula

Nulo provides formulas tailored to different life stages and dietary needs. Common options include adult maintenance, senior, and weight management formulas. Consider your cat's age, activity level, and any health concerns when selecting a formula. 


### Understanding Protein Sources

Protein is crucial for cats, and Nulo formulas use high-quality animal proteins as their primary ingredient. They source proteins from fish, chicken, and turkey, providing essential amino acids. Look for formulas that list protein sources as the top ingredient. 


### Evaluating Nutritional Content

Healthy cat food should provide balanced nutrition, including vitamins, minerals, and other essential nutrients. Nulo formulas contain omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids for skin and coat health, as well as probiotics for digestive support. Review the ingredient list to ensure it meets your cat's nutritional needs. 


### Checking for Food Sensitivities

Cats can be sensitive to certain ingredients. Nulo cat foods are free from artificial preservatives, colors, and flavors, making them suitable for cats with dietary restrictions. Common allergens like grains and fillers are avoided in Nulo formulas, focusing instead on whole animal ingredients. 


## FAQ


### What makes Nulo cat food different from other brands?

Nulo cat food stands out through its unique ingredient philosophy. Unlike many commercial pet foods, Nulo opts for whole animal ingredients, meaning each meat-based ingredient represents the entire animal, not just muscle meat. This commitment to whole ingredients results in foods that are closer to a natural feline diet, rich in essential nutrients and free from artificial additives. 

The company backs its products with extensive research and testing. Every batch undergoes rigorous quality control, and their recipes are developed based on insights from veterinary nutritionists and feline behavior experts. 


### Are Nulo foods suitable for all life stages?

While Nulo offers specialized formulas for specific life stages, their core diets are designed to support general health and well-being across different age groups. The brand recommends their adult formula for cats over one year old, but they have specific alternatives for growing kittens and senior cats. 

For cats with specific health needs, Nulo provides therapeutic diets that address issues like weight management, urinary health, and digestive support. Consult your veterinarian to determine the best Nulo formula for your pet's specific requirements. 


### How does Nulo compare to grain-free cat foods?

While many grain-free cat foods eliminate carbohydrates, Nulo takes a different approach by focusing on whole animal ingredients instead of grains. Their meals contain carbohydrates from fruits, vegetables, and potatoes, providing sustained energy while maintaining a meat-based diet. 

This carbohydrate source stands out in the grain-free market, where alternatives often rely heavily on vegetables which can be challenging for some cats to digest. Nulo's approach provides a balanced energy source without the need for grains. 


### Can I feed Nulo food from multiple bags to my cat?

Cats can safely consume meals made from different Nulo bags, though it's advisable to introduce new flavors gradually. Mixing meals from various bags is similar to offering different meats in a natural feline diet, providing a varied nutritional profile. 

However, if your cat has specific dietary needs or health conditions, it's best to consult with a veterinarian before rotating between different Nulo products. Monitoring your cat's response to each new food is always recommended. 


### What about Nulo's grain content?

Nulo meals contain grains, but these are not derived from grain fillers typically found in other pet foods. Their grains - including brown rice, barley, and oats - serve as high-quality carbohydrate sources that provide sustained energy and promote digestive health. 

For cats with grain sensitivities, Nulo offers grain-free options that use alternative carbohydrate sources like potatoes and sweet potatoes. The company's commitment is to use grains that offer nutritional benefits rather than including them for filler purposes. 


### Are there any potential drawbacks to Nulo cat food?

While Nulo cat food offers many benefits, some cats may have individual reactions to their ingredients. The whole animal ingredients can be rich in fat, which might cause digestive upset in some pets that are not accustomed to this type of diet. 

The brand's focus on natural ingredients means higher costs compared to many commercial pet foods. Additionally, the variability in ingredients between different Nulo products requires careful reading of labels to meet your cat's specific dietary needs.
