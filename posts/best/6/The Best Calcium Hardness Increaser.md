## Buyer's Guide

Calcium hardness increasers play a crucial role in maintaining optimal water balance in swimming pools and spas. These chemicals raise calcium hardness levels, which help prevent pool surface erosion and equipment damage. 


### Understanding Calcium Hardness

Calcium hardness is a measure of dissolved calcium carbonate in water. Proper levels (280-320 ppm for pools, 350-400 ppm for spas) ensure clear water and protect surfaces from deterioration. 

Water that's too soft (below 200 ppm) can cause etching of pool surfaces, while overly hard water (above 450 ppm) may precipitate out as scale. 


### Product Selection Criteria

Look for products containing pure calcium chloride or calcium bicarbonate. These provide effective, long-lasting hardness increase compared to cheaper alternatives. 

Consider the concentrate-to-use ratio - higher concentrations usually require less handling and storage space. 

Check for additional additives like stabilizers or pH adjusters, which may affect product performance. 


### Application and Dosage

Always add calcium hardness increasers to water, not the pool itself. Follow manufacturer instructions for correct dosage based on water volume and desired hardness increase. 

Test water chemistry before and after application to monitor changes. Allow adequate dwell time for the chemical to dissolve completely. 


### Storage and Handling

Store calcium hardness increasers in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture. Protect from physical damage during handling and transport. 

Use proper protective equipment like gloves and goggles when working with these chemicals. Ensure good ventilation during application. 


## FAQ


### What is Calcium Hardness, and why is it important?

Calcium hardness refers to the concentration of calcium ions in water, typically measured in parts per million (ppm). It's crucial in maintaining water quality and preventing issues like scale formation, corrosion, and poor swimmer comfort. 

Water testing kits can measure calcium hardness levels, which should generally range between 200-400 ppm for swimming pools and 60-120 ppm for hot tubs. Levels outside this range may require adjusting through the use of calcium hardness increasers. 


### What is a Calcium Hardness Increaser?

Calcium hardness increasers are chemical compounds specifically designed to raise the calcium hardness of water. They're essential for maintaining proper water balance, especially in pools and hot tubs with low calcium levels. 

These products commonly contain calcium chloride or calcium bicarbonate as their active ingredients. They're available in various forms, including dry packets, powdered formulas, and liquid solutions. 


### How do I use a Calcium Hardness Increaser?

Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for the specific product you're using. Generally, you'll need to dilute the chemical in water before adding it to the pool or hot tub. 

Test the water after adding the increaser to ensure the desired calcium hardness level has been achieved. Over-application can lead to elevated chlorine demand or scaling. 


### What are the potential side effects of using a Calcium Hardness Increaser?

The primary risk is achieving levels of calcium hardness that are too high, which can lead to scaling of surfaces and equipment. This requires regular monitoring and adjustment. 

Users with existing scaling issues may need to combine calcium hardness increasers with other treatments, such as acid reducers or scale inhibitors. 


### Can I use a Calcium Hardness Increaser in saltwater pools?

Calcium hardness increasers can be used in saltwater pools, but with caution. The conversion of salt to chlorine in saltwater generators consumes calcium, so regular testing and adjustment may be necessary. 

Always perform tests to ensure that calcium levels remain within the recommended range for saltwater systems, typically 300-400 ppm. 


### How long does it take for a Calcium Hardness Increaser to work?

The time it takes for a calcium hardness increaser to raise water levels varies based on the product concentration and initial calcium hardness. Small increases may take 24-48 hours to fully effect. 

For larger adjustments, it may take several days to achieve the desired result. Regular testing is recommended to monitor progress and ensure proper water balance.
