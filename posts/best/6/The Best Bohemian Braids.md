### What maintenance is required for boho braids?

Basic care includes weekly washing, regular checking for tangles, and monthly re-braiding to maintain the design. The frequency depends on the complexity of the style and daily activities. 

Extension maintenance involves regular protein treatments and gentle combing. Special attention is needed for areas with beads or other decorative elements to prevent damage. 


### Are boho braids suitable for special occasions?

Many boho braids work well for formal events when done with simple designs and natural fabrics. Hair that shows parts of the scalp can be more appropriate for casual events. 

To determine suitability, consider the venue's dress code, the design's complexity, and whether the braids will be visible to others. Some styles may need to be removed before certain activities.
