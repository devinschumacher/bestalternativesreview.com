### Additional Features and Accessories

Basic flip phones like the Jitterbug Flip focus on essential calling features. However, consider whether you need additional capabilities such as text messaging, camera functionality, or pre-installed apps. Some models offer basic camera features for capturing photos, while others include built-in apps for common tasks. 


### Carrier Options and Pricing

Flip phones often operate on older cellular networks, which can affect pricing and availability. Compare plans from different carriers to find the best deal for your usage needs.
