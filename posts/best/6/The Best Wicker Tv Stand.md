## Buyer's Guide

A wicker TV stand combines traditional craftsmanship with practical television storage. This versatile furniture piece offers an elegant solution for both modern and classical interiors, available in various sizes and styles to suit different living spaces. 


### Materials and Durability

Wicker furniture can be crafted from natural materials like rattan or synthetic variants. Natural rattan provides excellent durability when properly treated with waterproof sealants. Synthetic wicker stands offer superior resistance to weathering and require minimal maintenance. Consider the specific environmental conditions of your room when selecting material type. 


### Size and Space Requirements

Mitigate TV placement issues by measuring your available space before selecting a wicker stand. Standard television sizes range from 17 to 55 inches, with depth requirements typically between 18 and 24 inches. Factor in additional space for ventilation gaps and cable management to ensure proper airflow and equipment safety. 


### Stability and Weight Capacity

Wicker stands vary in weight capacity, usually ranging from 50 to 100 pounds. Calculate the combined weight of your television and any intended accessories to ensure the stand can support your setup safely. Verify if the stand has additional legs or supports for added stability, particularly important for larger screens. 


### Design Elements and Versatility

Wicker stands combine storage functionality with decorative elements, featuring open shelving, closed cabinets, or a combination of both. Opt for designs with adjustable shelf brackets to accommodate different television sizes while maintaining aesthetic consistency. The stand's height should complement room dimensions, generally keeping the TV at eye level from the seating area.
