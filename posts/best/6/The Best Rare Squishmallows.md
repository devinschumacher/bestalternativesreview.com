## FAQ

![Rare-Squishmallows-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Rare-Squishmallows-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are Rare Squishmallows?

Rare Squishmallows are special collectible plush toys featuring soft, huggably squishy bodies and detailed designs. Unlike regular plushies, these rare editions often have unique materials like plush velvet, metallic fabrics, or detailed embroidery. 

Each Rare Squishmallow comes with an identification code that reveals its specific edition details, similar to limited-edition collectibles. These codes can unlock special features on an app and provide additional backstory about the character. 


### How Do I Care for My Rare Squishmallow?

Rare Squishmallows should be handled with extra care due to their special materials. The plush parts should be spot-cleaned only using a slightly damp cloth. For detailed areas like embroidery or metallic fabrics, use a soft-bristled brush with fabric cleaner. 

Avoid washing Rare Squishmallows in machines; hand-washing is recommended. If needed, use a mild detergent and cold water, then air-dry flat away from direct heat sources like radiators or hairdryers.

### What Editions Have Been Released So Far?

The most popular Rare Squishmallow editions include the Velvet Collection, featuring plush velvet bodies, and the Celebration edition, which often has limited production runs. Each release adds new characters and themes, making each purchase unique. 

As new releases vary by region and availability, collection strategy requires attention to both online and physical releases. The app tracks available editions, helping collectors plan their purchases. 


### How Do I Authenticate My Rare Squishmallow?

Authenticating a Rare Squishmallow involves checking for specific details like the identification code on the tag, the quality of materials, and the presence of any special features. The identification code should match the details on the app and packaging. 

Comparison with known genuine products, especially for materials and construction, is crucial. Any discrepancies, like missing special features or incorrect code details, may indicate a counterfeit. 

![Rare-Squishmallows-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Rare-Squishmallows-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What Are the Most Valuable Rare Squishmallows?

The most valuable Rare Squishmallows often come from limited-edition releases featuring metallic fabrics, detailed embroidery, or special materials like faux fur or velvet. Editions named after specific themes or characters also appreciate in value. 

Collector interest drives pricing, so rare editions that stand out with unique materials or limited production tend to command higher prices. The identification code on the app can provide insight into rarity and value. 


### How Do I Trade or Sell My Rare Squishmallows?

Rare Squishmallows should only be traded or sold through official channels or reputable resellers to ensure authenticity. Check the app for authentication information before trading, and confirm condition matches the listing description. 

When selling, include all original packaging and identification materials. Clearly state the edition details and any condition notes in your listing description to help potential buyers understand the value.
