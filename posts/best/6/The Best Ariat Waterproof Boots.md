## FAQ

The primary difference is the waterproof membrane lining. These boots feature a proprietary waterproof membrane that prevents water penetration while maintaining breathability. 

Waterproof models also include additional protective elements like reinforced stitching, thicker leather in high-wear areas, and special heel designs to prevent water from backing up. 


### How do I properly care for my waterproof Ariat boots?

Regular care involves using a waterproofing spray every 3-6 months and applying a protective polish to restore shine and extend leather life. 

Always clean your boots with a mild soap solution and soft brush, avoiding harsh chemicals that can damage the waterproof membrane.

### Can I wear waterproof Ariat boots for work in different environments?

While designed for versatility, the specific performance depends on the boot model. Some are better suited for riding and ranch work, while others offer enhanced safety features for industrial use. 

Check the product specifications for details on environmental resistance, electrical conductivity, and chemical resistance, as these vary by model. 


### What size should I get for my waterproof Ariat boots?

These boots typically run true to size, so measure your feet and refer to the size chart provided by Ariat. Consider getting half sizes larger if you typically wear slimmer footwear. 

If you have wide feet or a higher arch, consider sizing up to ensure a comfortable, proper fit that allows for proper waterproof membrane function.
