## Buyer's Guide

A Pit Boss griddle is an essential piece of equipment for grilling steaks, burgers, and other foods to perfection. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the right griddle for your cooking needs. 


### Griddle Size and Shape

The cooking surface area and shape affect how many items you can cook at once and how evenly food cooks. Common sizes range from 22 to 26 inches in diameter. Longer, rectangular griddles allow cooking multiple steaks or larger items like whole chickens, while round griddles save counter space. Consider if you need a single large surface or multiple smaller griddles for various cooking tasks. 


### Griddle Material and Construction

Stainless steel griddles resist corrosion and maintain consistent heat distribution. Cast iron griddles have excellent heat retention but require regular seasoning and maintenance. Enamel-coated cast iron combines durability with easy cleaning. Stainless steel is more resistant to scratches and easier to clean than both cast iron options, making it a popular choice for busy grilling operations. 


### Heat Source and Controls

Pit Boss griddles are known for their high-quality gas burners that provide consistent heat. The number of burners affects cooking flexibility - two-burner models offer basic left-right temperature control, while multi-burner versions allow precise heat zone adjustments. Some griddles include built-in infrared technology for rapid temperature changes and precise cooking control. Consider if your cooking style requires simple heat adjustment or sophisticated temperature management. 


### Griddle Features and Accessories

Enhanced griddles feature drip pans, side shelves, or built-in tools for convenient cooking. Drip pans prevent spills and simplify cleanup, while side shelves keep utensils within reach. Some models include built-in plates for even heat distribution or non-stick coatings for easier food release. The number of included accessories varies by model, so check which features are standard and which require additional purchases. 


## FAQ


### What is a Pit Boss Griddle?

A Pit Boss Griddle from Pit Boss BBQ is a versatile cooking surface featuring an 11-inch diameter cooking area with a cast iron construction. It's designed for both indoor and outdoor use, making it ideal for backyard barbecues or kitchen counter space. 

The griddle includes a built-in temperature control knob that allows you to adjust the heat between 200°F and 500°F. It also has a drip pan for easy cleaning and comes with lifetime warranties on both the griddle itself and the temperature control system. 


### How does the temperature control work?

The Pit Boss Griddle features a simple yet effective temperature control knob located at the base of the unit. This knob lets you adjust the heat output from 200°F to 500°F in precise increments. The built-in thermostat maintains your selected temperature, ensuring consistent cooking results. 

Once you set your desired temperature, the griddle will automatically adjust its heating element to maintain that setting. The temperature display shows both the set and current temperatures, helping you keep an eye on your cooking environment. 


### What types of food work well on a griddle?

With its 11-inch diameter cooking surface, the Pit Boss Griddle excels at cooking pancakes, sandwiches, burgers, and breakfast items. The smooth surface and even heat distribution make it ideal for cooking delicate foods like eggs and pancakes without them sticking or breaking apart. 

Griddle cooking is also great for melting cheese, making grilled cheese sandwiches, or cooking foods that require even heat like eggs or thin cuts of meat. Its versatility makes it suitable for both breakfast and casual dinners. 


### How do I clean the griddle?

After each use, allow the griddle to cool completely before cleaning. The drip pan can be removed and emptied of excess grease, while the cooking surface can be wiped clean with a damp cloth. For tougher residue, you can use a mild dish soap and a stiff brush to scrub the surface before rinsing and drying thoroughly. 

For regular maintenance, the griddle should be cleaned and oiled after every use. This helps prevent rust and maintains the non-stick surface. The drip pan should also be checked regularly and cleaned as needed to prevent grease buildup. 


### Can I use the griddle indoors?

Yes, the Pit Boss Griddle is fully portable and can be used indoors. While it's designed for both indoor and outdoor use, we recommend using it in a well-ventilated area indoors to prevent smoke buildup. The griddle has casters for easy movement, making it convenient to switch between indoor and outdoor spaces as needed. 

Indoor use is particularly handy for early morning cooking or when outdoor weather isn't cooperating. The griddle's lifetime warranty covers both the unit and temperature control system, so you can rely on it for years of indoor and outdoor cooking. 


### What maintenance does the griddle require?

Regular maintenance for the Pit Boss Griddle involves cleaning the cooking surface after each use with a damp cloth and drying thoroughly. The drip pan should be empty and cleaned regularly to prevent grease buildup. For long-term care, the griddle should be oiled after each use to prevent rust and maintain its non-stick surface. 

Check the temperature control system regularly to ensure it's functioning properly and replace any parts under warranty if needed. The cast iron construction requires minimal maintenance beyond occasional cleaning and proper storage in a dry place when not in use.
