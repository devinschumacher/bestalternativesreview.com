## Buyer's Guide

Herb keepers are designed to maintain fresh herbs on your kitchen counter, combining style with functionality. Whether you're a culinary novice or a seasoned chef, a quality herb keeper can enhance your cooking experience and extend the life of your herbs. 


### Material and Construction

High-quality herb keepers are typically crafted from food-safe materials like glass or BPA-free plastic. Glass options offer superior visibility and a classic look, while plastic variants provide durability and are lighter to handle. Consider the base material's ability to retain moisture and prevent root rot.

### Size and Design

Most herb keepers come in standard sizes ranging from 4 to 8 inches tall, with widths between 3 and 6 inches. Consider a design that allows plenty of space for root growth while keeping the blade foliage upright. Some models feature built-in filters to improve air circulation, which can be particularly beneficial for certain herb varieties. 


### Maintenance Requirements

Proper maintenance is crucial for an herb keeper's longevity and performance. Look for features that simplify cleaning, such as removable parts or dishwasher-safe components. The design should allow for easy refilling and minimal disturbance to the roots during maintenance.

### Accessibility and Display

A well-placed herb keeper should be visible yet practical for daily use. The display location should receive adequate indirect light and be away from direct heat sources. Consider features that enhance both functionality and visual appeal, such as clear sides or decorative accents. 


## FAQ

![Herb-Keeper-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Herb-Keeper-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a Herb Keeper?

A Herb Keeper is a specialized storage solution designed to maintain the freshness of fresh herbs for an extended period. It combines moisture retention with air circulation to prevent wilting and maintain the herbs' vibrant color and flavor. 

The Keeper usually consists of a clear, airtight container with several small slots or compartments that allow controlled air circulation while keeping the herbs fresh for up to two weeks. 


### How does a Herb Keeper work?

Herb Keepers maintain freshness through a combination of moisture retention and controlled air circulation. The container keeps the herbs' leaves moist while allowing enough air exchange to prevent root rot. 

The small slots or holes in the container help regulate the amount of oxygen reaching the herbs, which is crucial for their long-term preservation. 

![Herb-Keeper-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Herb-Keeper-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What types of herbs can be stored in a Herb Keeper?

Most herbs can be stored in a Herb Keeper, including popular varieties like parsley, cilantro, basil, dill, chives, and mint. The Keeper works particularly well for leafy herbs with delicate leaves. 

Avoid storing woody herbs like rosemary, thyme, or sage in a Keeper, as they require different storage methods that provide better airflow around their stems. 


### How long do herbs last in a Herb Keeper?

When properly maintained, herbs can last up to two weeks in a Herb Keeper. The exact duration depends on several factors, including herb variety, initial freshness, and storage conditions. 

The Keeper significantly extends herb life compared to typical methods like wrapping in a damp paper towel or storing in plastic wrap, which can only keep herbs fresh for 3-5 days. 

![Herb-Keeper-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Herb-Keeper-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What maintenance is required for a Herb Keeper?

Regular maintenance is essential for optimal performance. Each week, remove any brown or wilting leaves, clean the container with soap and water, and replace the herb bunch if it becomes dry or limp. 

Pay attention to the herbs' condition; if they start to show signs of wilting despite regular care, it may be time to repot them in clean water or another compatible storage container. 


### Can multiple herbs be stored together in one Keeper?

While some herbs can coexist in the same Keeper, it's generally recommended to store them separately. Different herbs have varying moisture and air circulation requirements, which can affect their longevity. 

If you want to store multiple herbs together, choose varieties with similar needs and monitor their condition closely to prevent cross- contamination or uneven moisture levels.
