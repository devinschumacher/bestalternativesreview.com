## FAQ


### What is the main difference between a toaster oven and a regular toaster?

A toaster oven combines the functions of a conventional oven with the convenience of a toaster, while a regular toaster only heats and slots bread. Toaster ovens offer versatile cooking options suitable for baking, broiling, and roasting, making them ideal for small meals and quick baking needs. 

Most white toaster ovens have a capacity ranging from 1 to 2 cubic feet, featuring crumb trays, self-cleaning functions, and multiple heating elements for even cooking. Some models even include convection technology for professional results. 


### How do I clean my white toaster oven?

Regular cleaning prevents residue buildup and maintains your toaster oven's performance. Most white toaster ovens can be wiped down with a damp cloth for daily messes. For tougher stains, use a mixture of baking soda and water to create a paste, apply it to the affected area, and let it sit before wiping clean. 

Many models have removable crumb trays that can be washed in the dishwasher. If your oven has a self-cleaning function, use it according to the manufacturer's instructions for deep cleaning. 


### What size toaster oven should I get?

Consider the number of people you're cooking for and the types of meals you'll prepare. For single-person households or frequent use in dorms or apartments, a 1.2 to 1.5 cubic foot oven is ideal. Couples or those with space constraints might prefer an 1.8 to 2 cubic foot model. 

Measure your available counter space to ensure the toaster oven fits comfortably without obstructing access to other appliances. 


### Can I broil food in a toaster oven?

Yes, most white toaster ovens include a broiling function. Broiling allows you to cook food quickly at high temperatures from above, ideal for grilling meats and melting cheese. Always place food on the broiling pan provided and position it under the broiler element for best results. 

For even heating and to prevent uneven cooking, rotate the food halfway through the cooking process or use the "automatic broil" function if available. 


### What's the benefit of convection technology in a toaster oven?

Convection technology circulates hot air around the food using a fan, resulting in more even cooking and faster baking times. This feature works particularly well for tasks like baking bread, roasting vegetables, or cooking frozen meals. 

While convection ovens may be more expensive, the faster cooking times and superior results can save you both time and energy in the long run. 


### How long does a white toaster oven last?

With proper care, a quality white toaster oven typically lasts between 6 to 10 years. Factors influencing its longevity include usage frequency, maintenance habits, and the brand's reputation for durability. 

Many reputable brands offer warranties ranging from 1 to 3 years, which can indicate their confidence in the product's quality and durability.
