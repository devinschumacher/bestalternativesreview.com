### Comfort and Design

The Series 5000 features a sleek, lightweight design that's comfortable to hold during shaving.

### Care and Maintenance

Proper care extends the life of your electric razor and ensures optimal performance. Check if the model you're considering includes a cleaning base or specific maintenance features.
