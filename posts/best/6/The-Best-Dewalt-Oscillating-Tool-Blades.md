## Buyer's Guide

Oscillating tool blades from Dewalt offer versatility for various DIY and professional projects. Understanding blade specifications and applications helps select the right tool for specific tasks. 


### Blade Specifications

Key specifications include blade material (high-carbon steel, high-speed steel), length, width, and mounting system compatibility. High-carbon steel blades offer hardness but may crack under heavy load, while high-speed steel provides better impact resistance. 

Standard blade lengths range from 4" to 7", with wider blades offering faster material removal at the expense of access to tight spaces. Mounting systems typically use quick-release mechanisms for easy blade changes. 


### Application Considerations

Blades are categorized for specific applications: demolition, cutting, grinding, and polishing. Demolition blades excel in tearing down structures, while cutting blades are optimized for precision work. Grinding and polishing blades require higher quality steel and precise tooth configuration. 

Task-specific tooth patterns control blade aggression and material removal rate. Coarse teeth cut through material quickly, while fine teeth create smoother finishes with increased heat generation. 


### Installation and Maintenance

Proper blade installation prevents wobble and ensures efficient operation. Most Dewalt oscillating tools use ergonomic handles with interchangeable heads, making blade changes straightforward. 

Maintenance requirements vary by application. Blades used in wet or metal-cutting operations require regular cleaning and may need sharpening or replacement more frequently than those used for light-duty tasks. 


### Cost Considerations

Blade costs vary based on material quality, tooth pattern complexity, and manufacturer reputation. High-quality blades typically last longer but have higher initial costs. 

Saving money through bulk purchases becomes more beneficial as blade consumption increases for regular users. However, premium blades often provide better value in terms of longevity and material performance. 


## FAQ


### What types of Dewalt oscillating tool blades are available?

Dewalt offers a variety of oscillating tool blades, including cutting, sanding, and grinding options. The D79126 blade is a versatile cutting blade suitable for most materials, while the D79169 offers heavier-duty cutting capabilities for tougher jobs. 

The company also provides specialized blades for specific materials, such as the D79141 plastic cutting blade and the D79129 metal cutting blade. Sanding blades come in different grits, from the coarse D79170 (80 grit) to the finer D79171 (120 grit), allowing users to choose the right level of aggression for their sanding task. 


### What is the typical lifespan of Dewalt oscillating tool blades?

Blade life can vary based on usage frequency and material being cut. Under normal conditions, a good cutting blade might last 10-15 applications, while a sanding blade typically lasts 30-50 applications before requiring replacement. 

The D79169 heavy-duty cutting blade usually lasts twice as long as standard cutting blades due to its reinforced construction, lasting approximately 25-30 applications. 


### Can Dewalt oscillating tool blades be resharpened?

Most Dewalt oscillating tool blades are designed for single use and are not intended to be resharpened. The D79166 reversible cutting blade is an exception, featuring replaceable cutting edges that can be rotated for additional cutting time. 

For users who need extended blade life, consider purchasing multiple blades rather than attempting to sharpen single-use blades, which can be difficult to maintain properly. 


### What are the most commonly used Dewalt oscillating tool blade sizes?

The two most common Dewalt oscillating tool blade sizes are 3-1/4 inches and 4-1/4 inches. These standard sizes maximize compatibility with the company's range of compatible tools. 

Users with specialized needs might also utilize 2-1/2 inch blade accessories for working in tight spaces or smaller applications, though these are less frequently used than the standard sizes. 


### How should Dewalt oscillating tool blades be stored?

To prolong blade lifespan, store them in a dry location away from dust and debris. Keep them in their original packaging or in a protective sheath when not in use. 

Avoid exposing the blades to extreme temperature changes, as this can affect their performance and durability. Regularly inspect blades for damage before use and replace any showing signs of wear to prevent hazardous operation. 


### What maintenance is required for Dewalt oscillating tool blades?

Basic maintenance involves visually inspecting the blade for any signs of damage before each use. Check for cracks, splits, or excessive wear that might affect blade performance or safety. 

Replace any blade showing damage promptly. Additionally, clean the blade thoroughly before and after use to remove dust, debris, or material particles that could affect cutting efficiency or tool performance.
