## Buyer's Guide

Double dog crate furniture combines essential safety features with comfortable, spacious design for two pets. These modular systems offer customizable configurations to suit different living spaces and pet sizes. 


### Size and Space Requirements

Measure your available space carefully before selecting a double crate system. Each crate should allow at least 28 inches by 28 inches of floor space for optimal comfort. Consider the height needs of your largest pet, as taller crates provide better ventilation and visibility. 


### Construction Quality and Materials

Inspect the frame for sturdy welds and straight edges. Welded metal frames resist warping and provide reliable support. The inner panels and partitions should also be metal to prevent collapse during use. Some manufacturers incorporate plastic or composite materials, which may be lighter but less durable. 


### Access and Door Design

Each crate should feature a secure, easy-to-open door with a clip-lock mechanism. The doors must swing wide enough for your pet's comfortable entry and exit. Some models include fold-down doors or additional access points for better space utilization. 


### Customization and Portability

Modular systems often include adjustable partitions and door positioning options to accommodate changing pet sizes or additional crates. Look for wheels or casters on the base for easy mobility, especially if you need to move the crate between rooms or vehicles. 


## FAQ


### What is double dog crate furniture?

Double dog crate furniture combines the practicality of dog crates with additional amenities like raised feeding stations, sleeping platforms, or play areas. These designs help separate sleeping and eating spaces while providing secure environments for dogs. 

Common features include reinforced corners for stability, multiple entry points, and padded interiors for comfort. Some models include mesh walls for improved visibility. 


### Why choose double dog crate furniture?

These products create distinct living spaces for dogs, promoting good behavior through consistent routines. They're particularly useful for single-dog households with limited living space or multi-dog homes requiring separation. 

Many crates double as beds or play structures, helping prevent destructive behaviors associated with boredom in confined spaces. 


### What types of materials are used?

Most double dog crates are made from steel with wire mesh sides for durability. Some premium models incorporate solid wood frames with wire reinforcements. 

Thick padding in resting areas can be made from foam, memory foam, or recycled rubber. Higher-end crates may feature natural materials like reclaimed wood details. 


### How do you measure your dog for a crate?

Measure your dog's length from nose to tail. Add 7.5% to 10% to this measurement for the crate size. The width should allow your dog to stand up fully and turn around comfortably. 

Choose a height that prevents your dog from jumping out when fully grown. Most crates are adjustable in height for growing puppies. 


### How do you properly size a crate?

Most dogs should be able to stand up fully, turn around, and lie down comfortably in their crate. The ideal length is about 2-3 inches longer than your dog's body length. 

Width should be about one and a half times your dog's shoulder width. Consider buying the next size up for heavy setters or dogs who gain weight easily. 


### Can you use a kennel as a double crate?

Tall pet kennels often convert into double crates by adding a removable partition. This creates two separate sleeping areas while maintaining a single entry point. 

Some kennels feature top-and-bottom designs that split the space naturally without needing additional partitions. Always ensure the divided spaces meet your dog's size requirements.
