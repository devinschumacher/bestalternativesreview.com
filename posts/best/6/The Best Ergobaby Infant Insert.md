### What is an Ergobaby Infant Insert?

This insert features a built-in strap system that helps align the baby's body correctly, with special attention to supporting the head and neck. The material is breathable and washable for easy care.

The primary difference is the built-in support system for younger babies. The insert has a more structured shape that aligns the baby's body properly, while the regular carrier offers a more open design.

### Who is the Ergobaby Infant Insert intended for?

The insert is specifically designed for newborns and young infants who still need extra support for their head and neck. It's particularly useful for babies who can't yet hold their head up independently. 

Parents should consider switching to the regular Ergobaby carrier once their baby has developed better head control and is around 4-5 months old. 


### How do you use the Ergobaby Infant Insert?

The insert needs to be positioned between the baby and the carrier's mesh panel. The baby's legs should drape over the outside of the carrier while their back is against the insert. 

Use the side straps to adjust the baby's position, ensuring they're facing in and their head is properly supported. The chest clip should be adjusted to keep the baby secure and comfortable.

### How should you clean the Ergobaby Infant Insert?

The insert is machine washable, making it easy to keep clean. Use a mild detergent and cold water cycle for regular cleaning. Avoid bleach or harsh chemicals that could damage the material. 

For quick cleaning between washes, you can use a damp cloth to wipe down the insert. Make sure it's completely dry before using it again to prevent mold or mildew growth.
