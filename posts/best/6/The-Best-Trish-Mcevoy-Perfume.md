### Choosing Top Notes

The top notes are the initial scents that greet you when you spray the perfume. Consider whether you prefer fresh, zesty notes like citrus or light, airy florals for daytime wear, or deeper, spicier notes for evening. 


### Middle and Base Notes

Middle notes form the heart of the fragrance and develop about 15 minutes after application. Base notes emerge later and provide the lasting impression. Look for middle notes that complement your skin type and base notes that offer lasting appeal without being too strong.

### Testing and Patch Testing

Always test the perfume on your skin before purchasing. Apply a small amount to the inside of your wrist and wait 24 hours before making a decision. This allows the scent to settle and reveals if you have any adverse reactions.
