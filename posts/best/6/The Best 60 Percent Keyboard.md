## Buyer's Guide

60% keyboards represent a popular rebuke to the bloated, feature-rich designs of traditional full-size keyboards. By eliminating unnecessary keys and optimizing layout, these compact alternatives offer a more efficient typing experience while saving desk space. Understanding the specific benefits and considerations of 60% keyboards can help you find the right balance of functionality and design for your workflow. 


### Layout and Functionality

60% keyboards significantly reduce the number of keys compared to standard layouts, typically removing function keys and the right alt key. This streamlined approach often leads to improved finger navigation and reduced accidental key presses. The QWERTY core remains intact, but secondary functions are reimagined for efficiency. Consider your primary use case (gaming, programming, general productivity) when assessing which non-standard keys (if any) you might need. 


### Ergonomic Considerations

While the reduced key count can enhance typing efficiency, ergonomic design becomes particularly crucial in 60% keyboards. Look for well-placed wrist rests, symmetrical designs, and options like TklCaps for easy capital letter input. The horizontal vs. split keyboard orientation can greatly impact comfort, with split designs offering improved finger positioning but requiring more desk space. 


### Connection Options and Build Quality

Most 60% keyboards now support Bluetooth connectivity alongside USB ports, providing flexibility for both desktop and mobile use. Premium models often feature features like RGB lighting customization and anti-ghosting technology to prevent simultaneous key presses from registering incorrectly. The build quality varies significantly between manufacturers - high-quality options use aluminum panels or PBT keycaps for durability and typing feedback. 


### Software Compatibility and Customization

Modern 60% keyboards often come with robust software suites that allow extensive customization of key functions and lighting effects. These tools usually support multiple profiles for different applications or devices. For gaming enthusiasts, look for options with full N-Key Rollover (NKRO) support and customizable macro functions. Programming professionals might prefer models with advanced modifier key combinations and character mapping capabilities. 


## FAQ


### What is a 60 percent keyboard?

A 60 percent keyboard, also known as a 60% keyboard or 60% layout, is a compact keyboard that removes certain keys while maintaining essential functionality. This design reduces the keyboard's size by approximately 40% compared to a full-size 104-key desktop keyboard. 

Despite its reduced key count, a 60% keyboard typically includes standard typing keys (QWERTY layout), navigation keys (arrow keys), and essential function keys. The key removal usually affects rarely used keys like media controls, dedicated function keys, and additional navigation features. 


### What are the main benefits of a 60 percent keyboard?

The primary advantages of a 60% keyboard are its compact size and optimized space efficiency. Users can save desk space while maintaining essential keyboard functionality for everyday tasks. 

These compact keyboards often feature improved ergonomics due to their more natural hand positioning and reduced reach requirements for common keys. The simplified layout can also enhance typing speed and accuracy by removing unnecessary keys. 


### Which keys are typically removed in a 60 percent layout?

The most common keys removed in a 60% layout include the Windows key, Scroll Lock, and certain dedicated function keys (Fn keys). The backspace, tab, and enter keys maintain their positions but with fewer surrounding keys. 

Additional key removals often include media controls (play/pause, volume), numpad keys, and some secondary navigation features. The primary navigation keys (arrow keys) usually remain in their standard positions. 


### Are 60 percent keyboards suitable for gaming?

60% keyboards can be suitable for gaming, particularly for users who prefer compact setups or have limited desk space. Many gaming-oriented 60% keyboards include dedicated function keys and improved response times. 

However, they may not include all the secondary gaming features found on full-size gaming keyboards. Users should verify that the specific model meets their gaming needs in terms of key count, response time, and anti-ghosting capabilities. 


### What are the most common 60 percent keyboard layouts?

The most common 60% layouts include the QWERTY, Dvorak, and Colemak layouts. These are the primary typing layouts that maintain optimal finger placement and typing efficiency. 

Specialized layouts like the TKL (101-key) and MT (68-key) are sometimes marketed as 60% but contain additional keys. Users should verify the key count and layout before purchasing. 


### How do 60 percent keyboards compare to membrane vs. mechanical switches?

60% keyboards are available in both membrane and mechanical switch variants. Membrane switches are generally cheaper and more resistant to spill damage, while mechanical switches offer better typing feedback and endurance. 

Users who prioritize cost and spill resistance may prefer membrane switches, while those who value tactile feedback and durability should consider mechanical switches. The specific switch type is not exclusive to 60% keyboards and can vary across manufacturers.
