### Temperature Control

Atmospheric pressure builds steam at the right temperature for different brewing methods. Opt for a kettle that can maintain precise temperatures between 175°F and 212°F (80°C and 100°C) to ensure your tea or coffee brews perfectly every time. 


### Materials and Durability

Stainless steel construction provides durability and ease of cleaning. Check for double-wall insulation to maintain heat retention and prevent condensation on the exterior.

![Breville-Tea-Kettle-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Breville-Tea-Kettle-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Which Breville tea kettle should I choose?

Breville offers several tea kettles across their range, each with unique features. The MJ600TSR is popular for its precise temperature control and durability, while the TEK500 has a sleek design and easy-touch controls. Consider your specific needs for temperature control and material preference when selecting a model. 

For daily use, the MJ600TSR provides reliable performance with accurate temperature settings for different tea varieties. If you prefer a simpler design, the TEK500 offers excellent value with basic yet effective features. 


### How does temperature control work on a Breville tea kettle?

Breville tea kettles use digital technology to regulate water temperature. Models with precise control feature multiple setting options, allowing you to select the ideal temperature for different types of tea. For example, green tea requires lower temperatures than black tea. 

The kettles maintain water at the selected temperature using advanced heating elements that activate at specific intervals. This ensures consistent brewing without overshooting the desired temperature. 

![Breville-Tea-Kettle-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Breville-Tea-Kettle-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What materials are used in Breville tea kettles?

Breville tea kettles are primarily made from stainless steel and food-grade materials. The exterior construction typically features stainless steel or BPA-free plastic for durability and ease of cleaning. The interior contains 304-grade stainless steel, known for its resistance to corrosion and safe use with water. 

Select models include glass lids or windows that allow you to monitor the boiling process while keeping the kettle closed. These components are designed to withstand frequent use and maintain their clarity over time. 


### How much water can a Breville tea kettle hold?

Breville tea kettles generally come in standard sizes suitable for both single and family use. The largest models can hold up to 1.7 liters, while smaller options range from 1 to 1.2 liters. This capacity allows you to brew multiple cups of tea without refilling frequently. 

The kettles are designed with an optimal water level indicator. Most models have marks indicating 250ml, 500ml, 750ml, and full capacity, helping you measure the right amount of water for your brewing needs. 

![Breville-Tea-Kettle-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Breville-Tea-Kettle-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How long does a Breville tea kettle take to boil water?

Breville tea kettles heat water efficiently due to their rapid-boil technology. The typical 1.2-liter model brings water to a boil in under 3 minutes, while larger 1.7-liter models take approximately 4 minutes. The heating time depends on the initial water temperature and household electrical supply voltage. 

Once the water reaches the selected temperature, the kettle maintains it with minimal power consumption. This feature helps prevent overcooking and saves energy compared to traditional kettles that continuously reheat the water. 


### How should I maintain and clean a Breville tea kettle?

Regular cleaning helps maintain the performance and longevity of your Breville tea kettle. After each use, empty the kettle and allow it to cool before cleaning. Use warm, soapy water and a sponge to remove any residue or limescale. For tough stains, a mixture of baking soda and water can be effective. 

To prevent mineral buildup, especially in hard water areas, run a vinegar solution through the kettle every two weeks. Start by filling the kettle with white vinegar, let it sit for several hours, then flush with water and dry thoroughly before use.
