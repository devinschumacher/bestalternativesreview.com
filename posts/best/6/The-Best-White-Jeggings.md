These white skinny-fit jeggings create a slimming effect with their high-waisted, cropped design. The frayed hem adds a stylish touch while the pocket detail adds practicality. While the pull-on style makes them easy to wear, the lack of a zipper makes them a bit challenging to put on.

Made from a soft cotton blend with just the right amount of stretch, these white leggings have become a wardrobe staple for many reviewers who appreciate their flattering high waist and generous leg length.

## Buyer's Guide

White jeggings have become a versatile wardrobe staple, combining the comfort of elastic-waist pants with the stretchiness of spandex. When selecting your perfect pair, consider these key factors to ensure you find a style that fits well and matches your lifestyle needs. 


### Fit and Waistband

Jeggings typically come in three basic fit types: high-waisted, medium-waisted, and low-rise. High-waisted styles provide better coverage and stay up well during active movements, while low-rise options offer a more relaxed look. The waistband should have enough stretch to fit comfortably over your belly button but shouldn't be so loose that it bunches. Look for strong elastic that maintains its shape after washing.

### Stretch and Material Quality

Most quality white jeggings use a 92% polyester, 8% spandex blend, which balances softness with durability. The spandex content gives them excellent stretch and recovery, allowing them to conform to your body's shape while maintaining their form. Check for smooth, seam-free construction to prevent irritation during wear. 


### Length and Leg Opening

Standard jegging lengths range from capris to ankle-hugging styles. Consider your personal preference and intended use – longer options are ideal for cooler weather or layering, while shorter styles work well with open-toed footwear. The leg opening should fit snugly without constricting blood flow or causing discomfort during movement.

### Care Requirements

White jeggings typically require regular hand washing or gentle machine cycle cleaning to maintain their color and prevent fading. Look for wash labels indicating the recommended care method. Some jeggings include moisture-wicking properties or quick-drying finishes, which can be beneficial for athletic use or quick-dry applications. 


## FAQ

![White-Jeggings-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/White-Jeggings-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are white leggings (jeggings)?

White leggings, commonly known as eggings, are form-fitting leggings made from spandex or a similar stretchy material. They're called eggings because the word "leggings" is combined with the nickname for the letter "J" in "jeans. "

These versatile pieces range from opaque black to sheer options and come in various lengths, from capris to full-length styles. They're popular for both casual wear and athletic activities due to their moisture-wicking properties and stretchy construction. 


### What's the difference between regular leggings and white eggings?

While both leggings and white eggings serve similar purposes, white eggings typically use a more technical fabric designed for movement and moisture management. Regular leggings may offer fewer features like compression, built-in moisture control, or specialized stitching patterns. 

The primary visual distinction is color – regular leggings come in various shades, while white eggings maintain their pristine appearance longer through consistent wear and washing. 

![White-Jeggings-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/White-Jeggings-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do I wash white eggings?

Machine wash your white eggings using a mild detergent set on a cold water cycle to prevent color fading and shrinkage. Always check the label for specific care instructions, as some may require hand washing or specialized cleaning products. 

Avoid overloading the washing machine and consider washing them with similar colors to protect their pristine white appearance. Regular cleaning helps maintain their elongated shape and prevents odor buildup. 


### Can I wear white eggings to the gym?

White eggings work well for gym workouts due to their moisture-wicking properties and stretchy construction. Many activewear brands now offer technical options specifically designed for athletic environments. 

However, some gym-goers prefer darker colors or patterned designs to avoid visible sweat marks during intense workouts. The right color choice depends on your personal preference and the intensity of your exercise routine. 

![White-Jeggings-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/White-Jeggings-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Do white eggings stretch out over time?

Like most spandex garments, white eggings may stretch out slightly over time, especially around the ankles and waistband areas. Proper care, including regular washing and avoiding overloading the washing machine, can help maintain their shape. 

Some materials are more prone to stretching than others, so consider the specific fiber content when selecting your white eggings. If you notice significant stretching, it may be time to replace the garment. 


### Can I mix and match white eggings with other colors?

White eggings pair beautifully with many colors and patterns, making them a versatile base layer for both casual and athletic outfits. The uniform color allows for a clean, modern look when wearing them with colored tops or prints. 

However, some individuals may want to avoid mixing white eggings with extremely bright or dark colors, as the stark contrast can be visually overwhelming. Consider your personal style and the intensity of the colors when creating your outfit.
