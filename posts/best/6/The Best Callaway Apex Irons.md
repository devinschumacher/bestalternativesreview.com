### [2019 Callaway Apex Combo Irons](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Callaway+Apex+Irons?utm\_term=2019-callaway-apex-combo-irons)

![2019 Callaway Apex Combo Irons | Image](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcR\_\_qITylnPHMUt4pe0cw2A\_LPZD8u-pIVcp\_A9pDXGw5n0694rwa4vwZB\_8mnsB9jo0xAZ-hBvZu1mrapbT-kzwpXSZI0q&usqp=CAY)

When you combine Callaway's Apex and Apex Pro technologies into one iron set, you get a pretty impressive combo. I've played with the tour-level Apex Pro irons before, and these have that same solid feel and accurate ball flight. The long irons are incredibly forgiving, while the short irons give you that precise control you need for approach shots. I particularly like how the gap between the Apex 7 and Pro 8 iron feels natural once you're used to the slightly bigger heads in the longer irons. The only minor issue I've noticed is some minor rust in a couple of the Pro irons, but Callaway's customer service made it easy to return or get a discount, which is pretty sweet.

## Buyer's Guide

When evaluating Callaway Apex irons, several key features and considerations can help you make an informed choice. Understanding these aspects will ensure you find the right clubs that match your playing style and performance goals. 


### Forging vs Casting Construction

The manufacturing process significantly affects an iron's performance. Forging creates more consistent striking surfaces and better feel, ideal for players who value solid contact and feedback. Casting allows for lighter, thinner faces and increased flex, which can be beneficial for optimizing ball speed and distance.

### Face Cup Technology

Callaway's proprietary Face Cup technology reduces weight around the impact zone, directing more energy to the ball. This design feature is particularly beneficial for players looking to maximize distance and minimize spin. Understanding how this technology impacts your swing dynamics and ball flight patterns is crucial. 


### Flexibility in Loft and Lie Angles

Customization options for loft and lie angles allow fitting professionals to optimize each club's specifications for your swing characteristics. Proper customization ensures consistent ball flight across your set, enhancing both performance and confidence at impact.

### Shaft Options and Flex Profile

The shaft plays a significant role in ball flight and feel. Choosing between different flex profiles (regular, stiff, etc. ) affects launch angle, ball spin, and overall distance. Consider your swing speed and desired ball flight when selecting the appropriate shaft for each club. 


## FAQ

![Callaway-Apex-Irons-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Callaway-Apex-Irons-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What makes Callaway Apex Irons different from their predecessor?

The Callaway Apex Irons represent a significant evolution in design from their predecessor. Key differences include a thinner topline for lower center of gravity, wider sole designs for better turf interaction, and advanced face technology for increased ball speed and forgiveness. These improvements aim to deliver a more responsive playing feel while maintaining the precision and power of Callaway's iron designs. 

Players will notice immediately the lighter headweights, which contribute to reduced swing effort and faster ball speeds. The forgiving fairway designs also help manage mis-hits, making the set more approachable for players of all skill levels. 


### Which models should I consider in the Apex line?

The Apex Irons come in Standard, Tour, and Forged versions, each catering to different skill levels and preferences. The Standard aims to balance performance and playability, while the Tour offers a firmer feel with slightly thinner face construction. The Forged version incorporates more exotic materials and advanced engineering for maximum performance. 

Beginners and mid-handicappers might prefer the Standard model, while advanced players seeking more feedback and control might opt for the Tour or Forged versions. Personal swing characteristics and desired ball flight should guide the final selection. 

![Callaway-Apex-Irons-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Callaway-Apex-Irons-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Are the Apex irons suitable for all swing speeds?

Designed to accommodate a wide range of swing speeds, the Apex irons feature consistent moment of inertia throughout the set. This design choice ensures that players across different swing categories can benefit from their advanced technologies. 

Youth players and juniors may find the high-launching, draw-biased characteristics particularly advantageous for their swing speeds. Adults with slower swing speeds will also appreciate the set's forgiveness and reduced headweight. 


### What kind of materials are used in the construction?

Each Apex iron is constructed using a combination of carbon-fiber composite face inserts and a combination of urethane and chrome plating. The face inserts are engineered for maximum flex at impact, while the plating provides durability and visual appeal. 

The shaft attachments incorporate a proprietary system that allows for precise flex distribution, optimizing ball flight and feel through each iron. This material combination balances performance attributes like ball speed and spin with the durability needed for daily play. 

![Callaway-Apex-Irons-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Callaway-Apex-Irons-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How does the topline design affect performance?

The thinner, more contemporary topline shape of the Apex irons reduces interference during the swing, contributing to a more efficient transfer of energy from the club to the ball. This design helps players maintain their swing path and impact position more consistently. 

The reduced topline also contributes to a lower center of gravity, which improves ball flight by promoting a more penetrating launch angle. This design element particularly benefits players who struggle with mis-hits or those seeking to optimize their distance without affecting accuracy. 


### What maintenance requirements do the Apex irons have?

Callaway advises regular cleaning of the face inserts to maintain their performance. A soft, lint-free cloth or specialized brush works well for this maintenance task. The urethane coating should be protected from harsh chemicals and abrasives to preserve the club's appearance and performance. 

As with any high-performance iron, maintaining proper ball positioning and alignment at address can help prolong the life of the clubs through normal use. Proper storage in a dry environment when not in use will also help preserve the clubs' longevity.
