## Buyer's Guide

A cardinal feeder is specifically designed to attract and feed North American cardinals while helping to prevent interference from other bird species. These feeders combine functionality with visual appeal, featuring designs that cardinals find particularly attractive while also managing seed distribution to maintain a more natural feeding experience. 


### Design and Appearance

Look for feeders with red or bright orange elements, as these colors closely match the cardinal's plumage and tend to attract the most attention. The feeder's shape should be relatively large and robust, capable of supporting the weight of multiple birds simultaneously without tipping over or becoming overcrowded. 

![Cardinal-Feeder-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cardinal-Feeder-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Seed Dispensing Mechanisms

Effective cardinal feeders incorporate features that control seed access, such as hinged roofs or specialized ports that open when a cardinal's weight triggers them. These mechanisms help prevent seed waste and reduce interference from other bird species, maintaining a more consistent food source for the intended visitors. 


### Installation and Placement

Position the feeder near dense vegetation like shrubs or trees, as this provides cardinals with both food and a place to hide from predators. The optimal height is typically between 3 to 6 feet off the ground, and avoid placing the feeder near competing food sources like birdseed dispensers for larger, more aggressive species. 

![Cardinal-Feeder-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cardinal-Feeder-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Maintenance Requirements

Regular cleaning is crucial to prevent mold growth and ensure the health of your feathered visitors. Use a mild bleach solution to clean the feeder weekly, allowing it to air dry completely before refilling. Promptly removing any accumulated seed hulls or debris helps maintain hygiene and encourages cardinals to return for future feedings. 


## FAQ

![Cardinal-Feeder-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cardinal-Feeder-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What types of birdseed are recommended for cardinal feeders?

Cardinals prefer black oil sunflower seeds, which they find easy to crack open. These seeds contain high oil content and nutritious elements that attract cardinals effectively. While you can offer other seeds like safflower or nyjer, black oil sunflower seeds remain the top choice for these birds. 

Maintain a fresh seed supply to keep cardinals visiting regularly. Avoid moldy or dusty seeds, as these can harm the birds. Replace seeds every 3-4 days during warm weather to prevent spoilage. 


### How should I hang a cardinal feeder?

Place the feeder in a location away from dense shrubs or buildings where cats might hide. This helps protect feeding birds from potential predators. If you have multiple feeders, space them at least 10 feet apart to avoid competition. 

![Cardinal-Feeder-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cardinal-Feeder-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How much seed should I put in a cardinal feeder?

Start with about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of seed per feeding, depending on how many birds you expect. Check daily to see how much has been eaten. If seeds remain after three days, reduce the amount to prevent spoilage. 

Consider using a scaled measuring cup or kitchen scale to measure seed accurately. This helps maintain consistent feeding levels and reduces waste. 


### What maintenance is needed for cardinal feeders?

Check the feeder weekly for cleanliness and damage. Use a brush or water spray to remove seed hulls and residue, ensuring all parts are dry before reusing. Replace any worn or damaged parts promptly to maintain hygiene and functionality. 

Every three weeks, soak the entire feeder in a 10% bleach solution for 15 minutes, then thoroughly rinse and dry before refilling. This prevents the buildup of bacteria and fungi that can pose health risks to birds. 

![Cardinal-Feeder-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cardinal-Feeder-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do I attract multiple cardinals to my feeder?

Provide multiple feeders scattered around your yard to give cardinals more feeding options. Place these feeders near different types of cover - some in open areas and others hidden in shrubs - to suit different behaviors and preferences. 

Consistency is key. Maintain a regular feeding schedule and clean seed supply to establish your feeding station as a reliable food source. Cardinals will return if they find an attractive and safe feeding location. 


### How do I deter other birds from the cardinal feeder?

To discourage larger or more aggressive birds from stealing cardinal food, use a diameter-limited feeder designed to exclude birds over a certain size. These feeders allow smaller birds like cardinals and chickadees to feed while blocking access to larger species. 

Consider using a bird baffle placed between the feeder and its support structure. This physical barrier, typically a cylindrical or conical shape, prevents smaller birds from reaching the feeder while not hindering cardinals' ability to feed safely.
