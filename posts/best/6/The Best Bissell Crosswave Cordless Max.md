### What's the difference between the Crosswave Cordless Max and other models?

The Crosswave Cordless Max offers advanced features like a motorized brush roll and LED battery status lights. It also includes more attachments than basic models and has a longer runtime for its class. 

Its key differentiator is the soft-touch brush roll and motorized crevice tool, which are specifically designed for pet hair removal from various surfaces without damaging them. 


### How reliable is the Crosswave Cordless Max's filtration system?

The Crosswave Cordless Max features a 12-stage filtration system that captures 99.9% of fine particles, including pet dander and allergens. The filtration system is tested against ANSI/DHHS standards for indoor air quality. 

While effective, it's important to maintain the vacuum's filters and dust cup regularly to ensure optimal filtration performance and prevent clogs.
