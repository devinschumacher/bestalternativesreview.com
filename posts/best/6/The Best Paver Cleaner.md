## Buyer's Guide

Keeping pavers looking their best requires the right cleaning products and tools. This guide covers essential aspects of paver cleaning, helping you choose the best solution for your patio, walkway, or driveway. 


### Understanding Paver Cleaning Needs

Pavers expose the soil underneath, making them more susceptible to staining and weather damage than poured concrete. Regular cleaning removes dirt, moss, and algae that can damage the pavers and affect their appearance. 

Consider the traffic the pavers receive, the local climate, and the types of materials nearby when selecting a cleaning method. High-traffic areas and regions with heavy rainfall require more frequent and aggressive cleaning. 


### Evaluating Cleaning Products

Paver cleaners come in liquid, powder, and gel formulas, each with advantages for different cleaning needs. Liquid cleaners offer good penetration and rinsing properties, while powder cleansers deliver concentrated cleaning power. 

Look for products specifically designed for pavers, as they contain the right balance of cleaners and protectants. Some formulas include dealkalizers to neutralize the high pH levels that can damage concrete surfaces. 


### Choosing the Right Equipment

Beyond the cleaner itself, selecting the appropriate equipment ensures efficient and effective cleaning. Garden hoses and brooms handle light cleaning needs, while power washers offer quick solutions for heavily soiled areas. 

For stubborn stains or larger areas, consider investing in a pressure washer with adjustable nozzles. Using the wrong pressure setting can damage the pavers, so follow the manufacturer's recommendations for your specific equipment. 


### Following Proper Cleaning Techniques

Incorrect cleaning methods can damage pavers and surrounding landscaping. Always clean pavers in the direction water naturally flows, typically from the center outward. 

Begin with dry brushing to remove loose debris. Apply the cleaner according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually by spot-treating heavily stained areas. Avoid using harsh brushes or abrasive materials that can scratch the surface. 


## FAQ


### What is the purpose of a paver cleaner?

A paver cleaner is specifically designed to remove dirt, grime, and stubborn stains from concrete, stone, and other paver materials. This specialized cleaning solution prevents damage to the paving surface while effectively removing contaminants that regular household cleaners might miss. 

These products are often concentrated, requiring dilution with water before use. Proper application and dilution ratios must be followed to achieve optimal cleaning results without compromising the integrity of the pavers. 


### How do paver cleaners differ from general-purpose cleaners?

Unlike general-purpose cleaners, which can damage delicate surfaces or leave residue, paver cleaners are formulated to work safely on porous materials like concrete and stone. They break down tough stains without etching or harming the pavers. 

These cleaners also often contain sealer rejuvenators that help restore the original color and texture of pavers, protecting them from future damage and enhancing their appearance. 


### What surfaces are paver cleaners suitable for?

Paver cleaners are specifically formulated for concrete, stone, granite, terrazzo, and other paver materials. They are not suitable for use on non-porous surfaces like seal-coated driveways or painted surfaces. 

For best results, always test the cleaner on a small, hidden area first to ensure it doesn't damage the material or cause discoloration. 


### How do you properly use a paver cleaner?

Begin by thoroughly cleaning the surface with water to remove loose debris. Apply the paver cleaner according to the product instructions, usually by mixing with water in a garden sprayer. Apply the solution to the surface and let it sit for the recommended time to break down contaminants before rinsing thoroughly with water. 

Always work in sections, ensuring proper dilution and application to achieve the best cleaning results. Avoid over-concentrating the cleaner, as this can damage the pavers. 


### How often should pavers be cleaned?

New pavers usually need to be cleaned within 24-48 hours of installation to prevent soil and debris from staining the surface. Established pavers should be cleaned regularly, typically once every 3-6 months, depending on foot traffic and environmental factors. 

During heavy usage or in high-stress areas, you may need to clean monthly or even bi-weekly to maintain the pavers' appearance and protect the sealant. 


### Can paver cleaners be used on sealed pavers?

Yes, most paver cleaners are safe for use on sealed pavers. However, it's important to check the product label and manufacturer's guidelines to ensure compatibility with your specific sealant type. Some cleaners contain sealant rejuvenators that can enhance the sealant's performance during the cleaning process. 

Avoid using acids or harsh chemicals on sealed pavers, as these can damage the sealant and underlying surface material. If you're unsure about compatibility, perform a test on a small, inconspicuous area first.
