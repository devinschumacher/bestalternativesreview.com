## FAQ


### What is a Pit Shark Squat?

The Pit Shark Squat combines elements of the traditional squat with unique foot positioning to engage different muscle groups. It's designed to improve stability, increase hip mobility, and target the glutes and hamstrings more effectively than standard squats. 

This movement focuses on a deep squat position with the feet in a modified diamond stance, where the heels are together and the toes point outward at a 45-degree angle. The squat depth is typically deeper than a conventional squat, aiming for parallel with the ground or below. 


### What muscles does the Pit Shark Squat target?

The primary muscles worked during a Pit Shark Squat include the gluteus maximus, hamstrings, and quadriceps. The unique foot positioning and deeper squat depth also engage the adductors (inner thighs) and the hip external rotators. 

The movement also challenges stabilizer muscles across the core, providing a comprehensive workout for the lower body and core musculature. 


### Is this squat variation suitable for all fitness levels?

The depth and form requirements of the Pit Shark Squat make it more challenging than basic squats. It's particularly suitable for intermediate to advanced lifters who have established proper squat technique and mobility. 

Beginners should focus on mastering standard squat form and consider working with a trainer to learn proper technique. Individuals with knee or hip issues should consult a healthcare professional before attempting this variation. 


### What equipment is needed for performing Pit Shark Squats?

The only equipment necessary for performing Pit Shark Squats is a barbell or pair of dumbbells if you're using free weights. A squat rack or sturdy wall for safety assistance is recommended during learning phases. 

Wearing proper footwear with good arch support is important, as is using a squatting surface that provides adequate cushioning. Foam rollers or stability balls can also be helpful for mobility work before and after the exercise. 


### How does this squat differ from a Bulgarian split squat?

While both exercises emphasize unilateral leg work and improved hip mobility, the Pit Shark Squat requires more dynamic balance and stability due to its deeper depth and unique foot positioning. 

The Bulgarian split squat primarily targets the quadriceps and glutes of the front leg with less emphasis on deeper hip flexion. The Pit Shark Squat encourages a more symmetric load distribution between both legs while significantly increasing the range of motion. 


### What is the recommended progression for learning this squat?

Start with bodyweight squats to establish proper mechanics and depth control. Using a box or bench, practice squatting into a 90-degree angle before attempting deeper squats. 

Once comfortable with basic squats, progress to a slightly deeper squat using light dumbbells or a resistance band. Finally, incorporate the diamond foot positioning with a barbell, focusing on maintaining good form throughout the movement.
