## Buyer's Guide

A handgun safe is an essential investment for both concealed carry permit holders and firearm enthusiasts. These safes protect handguns while meeting legal storage requirements and providing peace of mind. Understanding key features and considerations ensures you select a safe that matches your needs and complies with local regulations. 


### Legal Requirements

Begin by checking local laws regarding firearm storage. Many jurisdictions mandate that handguns be stored securely, often requiring either a locked container or trigger lock. Understanding these regulations helps you select a safe that meets legal standards while providing adequate protection. 

![Handgun-Safe-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Handgun-Safe-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Protection Features

Look for safes with robust construction, such as heavy-duty steel walls and dual-lock mechanisms. Consider safes with interior padding to protect the firearm's finish and features like dehumidification for environments with high humidity. These elements enhance the safe's protective capabilities beyond basic storage. 


### Size and Compatibility

Measure your handgun and consider the safe's maximum capacity. While larger safes offer more storage, they may be heavier and more difficult to install. Ensure the safe's dimensions match your space and storage needs while providing enough room for the firearm and any required accessories. 

![Handgun-Safe-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Handgun-Safe-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Accessibility and Installation

Evaluate the safe's weight, dimensions, and installation requirements. Wall-mounted safes save floor space but require proper wall support, while floor-standing models provide stability but take up more room. Consider how quickly you need to access the firearm and select a safe with appropriate locking mechanisms for your usage pattern. 


## FAQ

![Handgun-Safe-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Handgun-Safe-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a handgun safe?

A handgun safe is a secure storage solution specifically designed to protect firearms, particularly handguns. These safes feature robust locking mechanisms and construction to prevent unauthorized access and environmental damage. 

Handgun safes typically come in three varieties: cable-locked, combination-locked, and key-secured models. Cable-locked safes use physical restraints, while combination and key-secured models require specific codes or keys to open. 


### What features should I look for in a handgun safe?

High-quality handgun safes should offer multiple locking points, thick steel construction, and tamper-evident mechanisms. Consider models with internal padding to protect firearms from scratches and dents, and those featuring biometric locks for enhanced security. 

Check for safes with adjustable shelving and adequate interior dimensions to fit your firearms. The safe's weight capacity and wall attachment requirements are also important factors to consider based on your installation location. 

![Handgun-Safe-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Handgun-Safe-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do I choose the right size handgun safe?

Measure the length, width, and height of your firearm to determine the minimum interior dimensions needed. Standard handgun safes range from 12 to 24 inches in length and 12 to 18 inches in height. 

Consider additional storage needs such as magazines, cleaning supplies, and accessories. Most handgun safes provide between 1 to 3 cubic feet of storage space, with larger models available for multiple firearm storage. 


### What are the primary locking mechanisms for handgun safes?

Handgun safes commonly use three locking mechanisms: cable locks, lever or dial combinations, and key-operated locks. Cable locks typically offer basic protection by wrapping steel cables around the safe's exterior. 

Combination and key-secured safes provide higher security through complex locking mechanisms. Combination safes require a specific numerical code, while key-operated safes use physical keys that must match the safe's specific model. 

![Handgun-Safe-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Handgun-Safe-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How should I install a handgun safe?

Handgun safes are generally wall-mounted or floor-standing. Wall-mounting requires drywall or solid concrete walls with adequate thickness (at least 3 inches) to support the safe's weight. 

Most safes come with mounting brackets and instructions for installation. For wall-mounting, use masonry anchors or concrete screws to attach the safe to the wall. Floor-standing safes require level surfaces and may include adjustable feet for stability. 


### How much does a handgun safe typically cost?

Entry-level handgun safes with basic cable locks start at around $100. These typically offer limited protection and may not be suitable for firearms storage. 

Higher-end models with biometric locks and reinforced construction cost between $200 to $1,000. Factors affecting cost include materials used, locking mechanisms, and additional features like internal padding and adjustable shelving.
