## Buyer's Guide

Understanding the right exterior garage lighting options can significantly enhance both security and convenience. These lights should balance bright illumination with efficient energy consumption while standing up to outdoor elements. 


### Brightness and Illumination

The light output, measured in lumens, should be sufficient to illuminate your garage entrance and driveway. For most residential garages, 1,500 to 2,000 lumens per fixture is ideal. Consider using adjustable mounting options to direct light where it's needed most, reducing waste and improving effectiveness. 


### Energy Efficiency

Look for LED or fluorescent bulbs that offer long-term energy savings without compromising brightness. LED bulbs, in particular, provide excellent longevity and performance. The initial higher cost is often offset by significant savings in electricity bills over time. 


### Weather Resistance

Choose garage lights rated for outdoor use, specifically those labeled "wet location" or "durable coating. " These fixtures are designed to withstand rain, snow, and temperature fluctuations. Regular maintenance access is also crucial; select fixtures with easily removable covers or simple mounting systems. 


### Installation and Wiring

Proper installation is essential for both functionality and safety. Consider the voltage compatibility of your existing electrical system before purchasing new fixtures. For ceiling-mounted overhead lights, factor in the weight rating and mounting requirements. Surface-mounted lights may be a simpler option for some installations. 


## FAQ


### What types of exterior garage lights are available?

Common options include flood lights, security lights, wall-mounted fixtures, and pendant lights. Each style offers different levels of illumination and design elements to suit various preferences and needs. 

Popular brands include Brand X, Brand Y, and Brand Z. These manufacturers typically offer a wide range of styles, including modern, traditional, and industrial designs to match your garage's aesthetic. 


### How do I choose the right brightness for my exterior garage light?

Consider the square footage of your garage and the distance from your main entrance. A general rule is to provide at least 10-20 lumens per square foot. 

For safety and visibility, aim for a brightness level that allows you to clearly see steps, walkways, and the garage door from a distance of 15-20 feet. 


### What features should I look for in an exterior garage light?

Opt for models with at least 3000K color temperature for reliable illumination, as warmer tones can distort colors and reduce visibility.

### How do I install an exterior garage light?

Begin by turning off power at your garage's electrical panel. Secure the light fixture to a sturdy bracket, then connect the wiring according to your light's manufacturer instructions. 

Properly ground the fixture and test it with a voltage tester before using. If you're unsure about installation, consider hiring a licensed electrician. 


### How much should I expect to pay for an exterior garage light?

Entry-level options typically cost between $20-50, while mid-range fixtures range from $50-150. High-end or custom-designed lights can cost $150-500 or more. 

Installation labor costs vary by region, but expect to pay $50-150 for basic installation, plus the cost of the light fixture. 


### How long do exterior garage lights typically last?

Most exterior garage lights have a-rated lifespan of 25,000 to 50,000 hours, depending on the quality and bulb type. 

Regular maintenance, including cleaning and checking for loose connections, can extend the life of your light fixtures. Replace bulbs when they start to dim noticeably.
