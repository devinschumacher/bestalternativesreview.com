## Buyer's Guide

A dash juicer is a countertop appliance specifically designed to extract juice from fruits and vegetables. These appliances are known for their efficiency and ease of use, making them a popular choice for home juice preparation. When selecting a dash juicer, several key factors will influence your choice, including the type of juicer, processing capacity, ease of cleaning, and additional features. 


### Types of Dash Juicers

There are two main types of dash juicers: manual and motorized. Manual dash juicers require manual pressure application to extract juice, making them ideal for occasional use. Motorized dash juicers use an electric element to spin a cutting disc, providing faster and more efficient juice extraction. Consider your juice preparation frequency when choosing between these options.

### Processing Capacity

The processing capacity of a dash juicer determines how much raw material it can handle at once. This capacity affects both the size of the juicer and its overall efficiency. For daily use or larger families, look for a juicer with a processing capacity of at least 200-250 ml per cycle. Smaller capacities (under 200 ml) are suitable for single servings or occasional use. 


### Ease of Cleaning

Ease of cleaning is crucial for maintaining hygiene and simplifying maintenance. Look for a juicer with parts that are dishwasher safe and a design that allows for thorough cleaning without disassembly. The number of parts and their complexity can affect both cleaning time and the risk of residue buildup.

### Additional Features

Many modern dash juicers offer additional features that can enhance their functionality and convenience. These may include preset programs for different types of produce, automatic pulp ejection, and different speed settings for various ingredients. Consider which features align with your juicing habits and preferences. Some models also come with accessories like measuring cups or recipe books to help you get started. 


## FAQ

### What makes the Dash Juicer unique?

The Dash Juicer combines powerful extraction with effortless operation. Unlike traditional manual juicers, it offers commercial-grade performance while being surprisingly simple to use. 

Key features include a 400-watt motor, BPA-free glass pitcher, and the convenience of pre-programmed settings for various fruits and vegetables. 


### How long does it take to clean?

After each use, the juicer's sieve and base need a quick rinse. The feed chute and lid require more thorough cleaning. Overall, the cleaning process takes about 5-10 minutes. 

For optimal performance, we recommend soaking the sieve and chute in warm, soapy water for 10-15 minutes before cleaning. 

![Dash-Juicer-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Dash-Juicer-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)

The Dash Juicer can extract about 12-16 ounces of juice per cycle, depending on the type and size of the produce used. 

For most recipes, you'll need 2-3 cups of produce to fill the included 16-ounce glass pitcher. 

![Dash-Juicer-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Dash-Juicer-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How noisy is it?

While the Dash Juicer is quiet enough for morning use, it's not completely silent. The motor produces a moderate hum during operation. 

Its sealed design minimizes noise from produce rolling around in the feed chute, making it easier to use than open juicers that can rattle during operation. 


### How long does it last?

The Dash Juicer is built for durability with BPA-free materials and a BPA-free BPA-free glass pitcher. The motor and base are dishwasher safe for easy care.
