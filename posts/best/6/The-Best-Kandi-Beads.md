## Buyer's Guide

Kandi beads offer endless possibilities for personalization and expression through customizable jewelry. Understanding their features and care requirements can help you make an informed choice. 


### Material Quality and Durability

Kandi beads come in various materials, from plastic to acrylic and glass. Consider the durability of the material based on your intended use and maintenance requirements. Glass and acrylic tend to be more resistant to scratches and fading but can be heavier. 


### Size and Shape Options

These beads are available in a wide range of sizes from tiny seed beads to larger decorative pieces. Shapes vary from simple spheres to complex faceted designs. The size and shape selection should match your design vision and intended wear location. 


### Color and Transparency Variations

Color options range from solid shades to gradient effects and metallic finishes. Transparency can also affect the appearance of your jewelry, with translucent beads adding depth and dimension to your designs. 


### Care and Maintenance

Proper maintenance extends the life of your Kandi jewelry. Most materials require regular cleaning with mild soap and water, while glass beads benefit from occasional polishing to maintain their shine. Store your jewelry separately to prevent scratching and tangling. 


## FAQ


### What are Kandi Beads?

Kandi beads are small, colorful beads that can be strung together to make bracelets, necklaces, and other accessories. They're made from high-quality plastic and come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and colors. 

These beads are popular among crafters and jewelry makers due to their durability and affordability. They're also loved by children and adults who enjoy bead-adding parties and DIY jewelry projects. 


### What shapes are available?

The most common Kandi bead shapes include round, oval, and square. However, many varieties feature unique shapes like hearts, stars, and spirals, making each piece of jewelry distinctive. 

Some specialty Kandi beads incorporate patterns or designs into their shape, such as segmented rings or intricately carved stones, adding an extra layer of visual interest to your creations. 


### How do I care for Kandi Beads?

Regular dusting with a soft cloth keeps Kandi beads clean and extends their lifespan. For more thorough cleaning, use mild soap and warm water, then dry immediately to prevent drying or cracking. 

If your beads become tangled, gently separate them with your fingers or a small brush. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials that could damage the plastic. 


### What sizes are available?

Common Kandi bead sizes range from 2-6 millimeters in diameter, with options for both standard and larger projects. Some specialty sets include beads as small as 1 millimeter for detailed work. 

For specific measurements, check the product description. Sizes may vary slightly between manufacturers, so it's a good idea to measure your desired beads before purchasing. 


### How durable are Kandi Beads?

These beads are made from impact-resistant plastic that holds up well to normal wear and tear. They resist fading from sunlight and maintain their shape under most conditions. 

However, extreme heat or cold may affect the plastic's flexibility, and frequent exposure to harsh chemicals can damage them over time. Proper storage in a cool, dry place helps preserve their quality. 


### What color options are available?

Kandi beads come in every color of the rainbow, including metallic finishes and glitter effects. Manufacturers often combine multiple colors in a single set for versatile jewelry-making. 

Specialty packs may include rare color combinations or glow-in-the-dark varieties, offering exciting options for creative jewelry projects.
