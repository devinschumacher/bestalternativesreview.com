## FAQ


### What is the Roomba I7 Plus?

The Roomba I7 Plus is a robotic vacuum cleaner from iRobot that features advanced mapping technology and performance improvements over its predecessor. It can clean your home while you're at work or asleep, leaving your floors clean when you return. 

Equipped with a LIDAR-like sensor and VSLAM technology, the I7 Plus creates detailed maps of your home, recognizing and navigating around furniture and obstacles with precision. This allows it to clean effectively without unnecessary backtracking or missed spots. 


### How does the Roomba I7 Plus clean?

The I7 Plus uses iRobot's Smart Navigation 2.0 system, which combines LIDAR-like sensor technology with VSLAM capabilities to map and clean your home efficiently. While cleaning, it can identify and avoid obstacles, and its advanced mapping allows it to return to previously cleaned areas if needed. 

The vacuum features a high-performance brush system and powerful suction, making it suitable for both dry and wet debris. The edge-cleaning system ensures it can clean baseboards and wall corners effectively. 


### What features differentiate the I7 Plus from other models?

Key differentiators include the addition of iAdapt 2.0, which optimizes cleaning patterns based on room type and surface material, and improved sensor technology for better obstacle detection. The I7 Plus also features enhanced battery management and a more efficient cleaning algorithm compared to previous models. 

It comes with a redesigned base station that includes a built-in water tank for mop cleaning, allowing it to automatically clean both dry and wet floors without needing to be unplugged between uses. 


### How long does the Roomba I7 Plus' battery last?

The I7 Plus has a 150-minute run time on a single charge, which is the longest of any iRobot vacuum. This allows it to clean larger homes efficiently before needing to return to the base station for a recharge. 

When the battery is low, it automatically returns to the base station to charge. During charging, it can also perform maintenance tasks like cleaning the edge brush and self-docking for optimal performance. 


### What type of suction and filtration does it have?

The Roomba I7 Plus features advanced filtration with a multi-stage cleaning system, including a HEPA-like filter that captures 99% of fine particles, such as pollen and dust mites. The brush roll design helps prevent hair and debris buildup. 

The vacuum delivers 2x the suction power of previous models, making it effective for pet hair and other fine debris. It automatically vacuums hair and dirt from its own brush system during maintenance cycles to maintain consistent cleaning performance. 


### How easy is it to maintain?

The maintenance schedule for the I7 Plus is automatic through its scheduling feature, which performs maintenance cleaning when needed based on usage patterns. This includes cleaning the brush system, which prevents jams and maintains suction power. 

The base station includes a self-docking feature that allows the robot to return for maintenance when its battery is low. Cleaning both dry and wet floors without manual intervention helps reduce maintenance needs and prevent dirt from redepositing on your floors.
