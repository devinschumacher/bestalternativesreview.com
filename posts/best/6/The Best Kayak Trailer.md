## Buyer's Guide

A kayak trailer is an essential investment for transporting your kayak safely and efficiently. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the right trailer for your needs. 


### Trailerable Kayak Size

Consider the length and width of your kayak to determine the appropriate trailer size. Most standard trailers can handle kayaks up to 16 feet in length. Ensure the trailer bed width matches your kayak's width to maintain stability during transport. 


### Plywood Construction

Premium trailers use marine-grade plywood, which resists moisture and warping better than standard plywood. Look for cross-bracing and reinforced corners for added strength. The bed surface should be smooth with no sharp edges to protect your kayak's hull. 


### Welded Frame

A trailer with a welded frame provides superior durability compared to bolted components. The frame should be constructed from corrosion-resistant materials like mild steel or aluminum. Properly welded joints prevent gaps that could damage your kayak during transport. 


### Cargo Capacity and Distribution

Modern trailers offer load distribution systems that help balance weight between the tongue and axle. Consider a trailer with adjustable axles or load bars to optimize weight distribution. The total weight capacity should exceed your kayak's weight plus any additional gear or supplies. 


## FAQ


### What is a kayak trailer?

A kayak trailer is a specialized trailer designed to transport kayaks safely and efficiently. It features a raised deck specifically sized to accommodate the width and shape of a kayak, with secure straps and tie-down points to prevent movement during transport. 

Rigid, folding, and inflatable types are available. Rigid trailers offer stability but require more storage space, while folding and inflatable models are more portable and easier to store when not in use. 


### What size kayak can you tow with a trailer?

Most kayak trailers can tow kayaks up to 12 feet (3.65 meters) in length and 300 pounds (136 kg) in weight. Be sure to check your trailer's specifications, as capacity varies between manufacturers. 

When selecting a trailer, measure your kayak against the trailer's dimensions and verify that the loading ramp and deck clearance accommodate your specific model. 


### How much does a kayak trailer cost?

Basic kayak trailers range from $150 to $300, while premium models with features like hydraulic ramps and anti-theft protection can cost between $800 and $2,500. Inflatable trailers typically fall within the $200 to $600 range. 

Cost varies based on materials, features, and manufacturer. Consider your budget, storage needs, and intended use when selecting a trailer model. 


### What maintenance is required for a kayak trailer?

Regular maintenance includes checking the trailer frame for corrosion, lubricating moving parts, inspecting the tongue and coupler, and ensuring all bolts are tightened. The loading deck, wheels, and axles should be checked monthly. 

Seasonal maintenance may include wheel and tire inspection, checking fluid levels, and addressing any wear or damage from storage. A thorough annual inspection by a professional is recommended for safety and longevity. 


### How do you properly load a kayak onto a trailer?

Position the kayak perpendicular to the trailer, with the cockpit facing the rear. Use the loading ramp to gently pull the kayak onto the raised deck, ensuring it is centered and slightly angled forward for stability. 

Deploy the kayak lift straps, securing the bow and stern to the deck/frame. Place the included blocking wedges under the kayak's front and rear to prevent movement during transport. Secure all straps and double-check the load before towing. 


### Where should you store a kayak trailer?

Store the trailer in a dry, shaded area when not in use to prevent damage from sun, moisture, and temperature fluctuations. If storing indoors, use a covered garage or storage shed with good ventilation. 

For outdoor storage, especially in humid or coastal environments, consider using a protective cover to shield the trailer from weather elements. Keep the trailer elevated on wheels or jacks to prevent ground moisture from causing damage.
