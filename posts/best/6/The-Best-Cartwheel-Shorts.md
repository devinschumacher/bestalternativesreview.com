## Buyer's Guide

Cartwheel shorts are a specialized piece of gymnastics equipment designed to protect gymnasts during cartwheel exercises. These shorts feature unique padded designs specifically engineered for cartwheel movement, offering better protection and performance than standard gymnastics shorts. 


### Core Protection Features

The most crucial aspect of cartwheel shorts is their padding, which is strategically placed to protect the gymnast's hips, knees, and lower back during cartwheel execution. Look for shorts with reinforced padded areas over the hip bones, knee caps, and lower back region. 


### Material and Construction

High-quality cartwheel shorts are made from durable, moisture-wicking materials that provide both protection and comfort. The padding should be firmly attached to the shorts without affecting flexibility. Many gymnasts prefer shorts with a slightly thicker waistband for added support during cartwheel execution. 


### Fit and Mobility

A proper fit is essential for cartwheel shorts, as ill-fitting shorts can cause discomfort or restrict movement. These shorts typically have a slightly higher rise than standard gymnastics shorts to provide better protection during cartwheel landings. The leg openings should be secure but not too tight, allowing for full range of motion. 


### Care and Maintenance

Proper maintenance extends the life of cartwheel shorts and ensures their protective qualities remain effective. These shorts should be machine washable using a gentle detergent, with Velcro closures being particularly sensitive to harsh cleaning products. Regular air drying in a shady area prevents moisture buildup that can damage the padding material.
