### [USPSA A-C Zone Target](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Uspsa+Targets?utm\_term=uspsa-a-c-zone-target)

![USPSA A-C Zone Target | Image](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcR1hRkwIHn6XRrcN-\_sG7MJqaDkgk6\_zVspfEj469ayduyhLOuEAemT-pfz5B5qC3bEWY6usCDKOJ05Zdb1Br64AXWZS9vyvCCl1Mh1C1iBOBNEB4Y9K6UEUw&usqp=CAY)

Crafted for USPSA competitions, these targets are the real deal. At 6" by 12", they're big enough to see from a decent distance, though you might want to grab a few extra – the reviewer definitely thinks you'll want more than one. The AR500 material can handle 700fpe, which means you're getting serious protection behind your investment.

These USPSA targets pack a serious 700 foot-pounds of energy, though you'll want to be comfortable with that kind of oomph before you start shooting at them. The 6"x11" size and 1/4" AR500 construction make them about the same shape as a regulation USPSA target, with similar protection levels. The reviewer really likes them and plans to buy more, so they seem pretty reliable for hitting.

## Buyer's Guide

USB-powered targets offer an immersive training experience while being convenient for home or range use. Understanding key specifications will help you select a target that matches your training needs and shooting discipline. 


### Power Options

USB targets vary in power consumption requirements. Some models need a dedicated USB port, while others can draw power from any USB hub. Consider storage space and the number of targets you'll be using simultaneously when selecting your power source.

### Size and Structure

Target size affects the distance at which it can be engaged effectively. Common sizes range from 12" to 24", with larger targets recommended for longer ranges or heavier calibers. The backing material should resist deformation under impact and be resistant to weather damage. 


### Impact Response

Most USB targets use sound or vibration feedback to indicate hits, but the response time and sensitivity vary between models. Consider how quickly the target reacts to impact and how clearly it distinguishes between different calibers.
