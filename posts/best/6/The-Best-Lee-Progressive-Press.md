## FAQ


### What is a Lee Progressive Press?

The Lee Progressive Press is a specialized tool designed for progressive die stamping, a manufacturing process that shapes metal sheet materials through multiple operations in a single hit. This versatile machinery allows for the production of complex metal parts with high precision and efficiency. 

Compatible with various die configurations, the progressive press works by feeding sheet metal through a series of sequentially actuated dies, each performing a specific operation on the material. This continuous process significantly reduces production time and waste compared to traditional stamping methods. 


### What materials can be stamped using a Lee Progressive Press?

The Lee Progressive Press is capable of stamping a wide range of metal materials, including carbon steel, stainless steel, aluminum, brass, and copper. The specific materials that can be processed are determined by factors such as material thickness, hardness, and intended application. 

The press's robust construction and precise control systems enable it to handle both thin-gauge sheet metals for consumer goods and thicker materials for industrial components. The maximum sheet size typically ranges from 24 to 48 inches, depending on the model and configuration.
