## Buyer's Guide

A 60Hz monitor refresh rate is suitable for basic computing tasks and casual gaming, offering smooth video playback and stable performance for most applications. Understanding key specifications and use cases will help you select a monitor that meets your needs without unnecessary features. 


### Display Technology and Size

Popular display technologies include LED, IPS, and VA panels. LED-backlit monitors provide good color accuracy and energy efficiency. IPS panels offer wider viewing angles, while VA panels excel in contrast ratio. Monitor sizes range from 21.5 to 27 inches, with 24 inches being a common balance between portability and workspace comfort. 


### Input Specifications

60Hz monitors typically support standard video inputs like HDMI and DisplayPort. Check if your graphics card outputs at 60Hz to avoid down-conversion artifacts. For gaming, consider monitors with free-sync or gsync technology to eliminate screen tearing and input lag. 


### Color and Display Settings

Calibration is crucial for accurate colors, especially for professional use. Monitors with sRGB color gamut and 72-95% NTSC coverage are suitable for most applications. Windows 10 and Mac OS provide basic calibration tools, but dedicated software can offer finer adjustments. 


### Connecting Multiple Devices

Most 60Hz monitors support daisy-chaining via DisplayPort Alt Mode. This allows you to connect multiple laptops or computers to a single monitor, though total refresh rate may be shared between connected devices. Consider USB-C ports for charging and additional display outputs. 


## FAQ


### What is refresh rate, and why is 60Hz important?

Refresh rate determines how often a display updates its image per second, measured in Hertz (Hz). A 60Hz monitor refreshes the screen 60 times per second. This is important for smooth motion, particularly in applications like gaming and video playback. 

Higher refresh rates typically offer smoother motion, but 60Hz is sufficient for most non-gaming applications and many basic gaming tasks. It's ideal for productivity work, general web browsing, and watching standard definition videos. 


### Are 60Hz monitors suitable for gaming?

While higher refresh rates provide more fluid motion, modern gaming often requires at least 120Hz or 144Hz screens for the best experience. However, 60Hz can still handle most games smoothly, especially at lower settings and non-gaming tasks. 

60Hz monitors are a good choice for gaming on older or budget systems, or for those who prefer lower power consumption and simpler setup. They excel at competitive gaming when partnered with fast refresh rate monitors or displays with adaptive sync technology. 


### What's the difference between 60Hz and higher refresh rate monitors?

Higher refresh rate monitors display more frames per second, which means smoother motion for fast-moving content. 60Hz monitors are ideal for most daily activities but fall short in applications requiring high frame rates, like modern gaming or professional video editing. 

While 60Hz monitors use less power and have simpler hardware requirements, higher refresh rate displays offer a superior viewing experience for gaming and dynamic content. The choice depends on your specific needs and whether you prioritize performance or power efficiency. 


### Do 60Hz monitors have motion blur?

60Hz monitors display one frame at a time, meaning there's a brief period where only part of the image is visible between refreshes. This can cause motion blur when viewing fast-moving content, though it's generally less noticeable than on lower refresh rate displays. 

Most 60Hz monitors include motion interpolation features that create additional frames between existing ones, reducing perceived motion blur. This can significantly improve the viewing experience for dynamic content, though the effectiveness varies by implementation. 


### Are 60Hz monitors power-efficient?

60Hz monitors use less power than higher refresh rate displays because they require fewer backlighting cycles per second. This can lead to longer battery life in portable devices and reduced energy consumption in desktop applications. 

While the power savings may not be substantial, 60Hz displays are particularly beneficial for laptops where every watt counts. They still maintain sufficient performance for demanding applications while offering a more efficient alternative to higher refresh rate panels. 


### Can I upgrade a 60Hz monitor's refresh rate?

The refresh rate of a monitor is fixed and cannot be changed through software updates. You can't convert a 60Hz display into a higher refresh rate model, though some monitors support adaptive sync technologies that can dynamically adjust within certain limits. 

For serious gaming or professional applications, you'll need to replace the monitor with a model featuring the desired refresh rate. However, 60Hz monitors often perform well for their intended use cases, particularly when paired with appropriate hardware and display settings.
