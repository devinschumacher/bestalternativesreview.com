## Buyer's Guide

Dragon pinatas combine Asian symbolism with Latin American tradition for a unique party favor or centerpiece. Here's what to consider when selecting the perfect dragon pinata for your celebration. 


### Size and Proportions

Standard dragon pinatas range from 3 to 6 feet tall, though custom sizes are available. Consider the space where the pinata will be hung and the number of players. Taller dragons engage more guests but require higher ceilings. 


### Solidity and Fill Materials

Modern dragon pinatas can be solid or filled with candy and toys. Solid dragons made from papier-mâché or foam are lighter and easier to transport. Filled dragons typically contain a combination of candy, small toys, and noise-makers. 


### Decorative Elements

Detailed decorative elements like scales, wings, and claws can enhance the pinata's appearance. Quality materials include fabric, foam, and paint. Consider the dragon's color scheme to match your party theme. 


### Weight and Balance

The dragon's weight should be distributed for easy hanging and swinging. Heavier elements should be placed closer to the bottom to prevent tipping. The pinata's center of gravity affects its swing and display stability.
