## Buyer's Guide

Rum-infused butter candies, often packaged in the distinctive ring-shaped "Lifesaver" design, combine rich caramel flavor with the warm spiciness of rum. These confections are available in various strengths, ranging from mild to bold, catering to different palates and tolerance levels. Understanding the key aspects of these candies can help you choose the right product for your taste preferences and occasion. 


### Flavor Strengths

Rum intensity varies significantly between different Butter Rum Lifesavers. The scale typically ranges from 1 to 10, with 1 being barely noticeable and 10 providing a strong, complex flavor profile. Consider your sensitivity to alcohol and the occasion's setting when selecting a strength level. Mild options (1-3) are ideal for casual gatherings, while stronger variants (7-10) suit more intimate settings where the complex flavors can be appreciated. 


### Form and Packaging

These candies come in both traditional ring-shaped pieces and solid block formats. Ring-shaped candies (approximately 1 inch in diameter) offer a simple, universally recognized format that's easy to consume and share. Solid blocks provide a different consumption experience, allowing for single-serving portions that can be broken off as needed. Both formats come in various package sizes, from small travel pouches to larger containers suitable for entertaining. 


### Storage and Handling

Proper storage is crucial for maintaining the candies' quality and flavor. Store unopened packages at room temperature away from direct sunlight and moisture. Once opened, transfer remaining candies to an airtight container to preserve freshness. The natural butter content can attract fruit flies, so consider using additional protective measures like sealable mason jars if you're concerned about pantry infestations. 


### Consumption Tips

To fully appreciate Butter Rum Lifesavers, consider pairing them with complementary foods. The rich caramel base works well with salty snacks like popcorn or cheese, while the alcohol content may enhance the flavor of rich chocolate desserts. When serving, keep a glass of water nearby to help cleanse the palate between servings. Always consume these candies responsibly, particularly when sharing with guests who may be driving or operating machinery afterward. 


## FAQ


### Are Butter Rum Lifesavers dairy-free?

Yes, Butter Rum Lifesavers use a non-dairy substitute to create their creamy texture. The product is made with coconut oil instead of milk, making it suitable for vegans and those avoiding dairy. 

While the ingredient list may vary slightly between batches, the manufacturers consistently use a dairy-free alternative to maintain the specialty flavor profile. 


### How long do Butter Rum Lifesavers last?

Uncartonned Butter Rum Lifesavers should be consumed within 2 weeks of opening to maintain their quality and flavor. The carton provides extra protection, extending their shelf life to approximately 6 months when stored in a cool, dry place. 

After opening, store the lifesavers in an airtight container in the pantry for best results. For maximum freshness, consume within 2 weeks of opening. 


### Are Butter Rum Lifesavers keto-friendly?

While Butter Rum Lifesavers contain some natural sweeteners, their typical serving size (one lifesaver) provides around 18 grams of carbohydrates, 9 of which come from sugar alcohols like erythritol. This makes them unsuitable for strict ketogenic diets. 

Highest carbohydrate content occurs in the original butter rum variety, with sugar-free alternatives offering fewer net carbs from natural sweeteners and sugar alcohols. 


### What's the calorie count?

Each Butter Rum Lifesaver typically contains about 30 calories. The serving size of one lifesaver provides minimal impact on daily calorie intake while offering flavor satisfaction. 

Calorie count varies slightly between varieties, with sugar-free options from Nutty Peanut Butter yielding around 33 calories per piece. 


### Are they gluten-free?

Yes, Butter Rum Lifesavers are certified gluten-free. The manufacturers rigorously follow gluten-free protocols in their production facilities to prevent cross-contamination with wheat-based products. 

Look for the official "Gluten-Free" certification on product packaging to confirm the gluten-free status, as this information is prominently displayed. 


### Are they suitable for people with nut allergies?

Butter Rum Lifesavers are not suitable for people with nut allergies. All varieties contain peanut oil or peanut butter as key ingredients, which can cause severe allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. 

The product packaging clearly states "Contains Tree Nuts (Peanuts)" to alert those with nut allergies about the presence of peanut-derived ingredients.
