## Buyer's Guide

Air purifiers improve indoor air quality by removing contaminants, but not all models are created equal. Understanding key features helps you choose a purifier that matches your space and needs without breaking the bank. 


### Filter Technology

Cheap air purifiers often use basic HEPA filters that capture large particles. For better performance, look for models with True HEPA filters that capture 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns. Some advanced models include activated carbon filters to remove odors and chemicals. 

![Cheap-Air-Purifier-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cheap-Air-Purifier-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### CADR Ratings

While expensive, CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate) ratings provide a standardized comparison of air purifier performance across different particle sizes. The higher the CADR, the more effective the purifier. For most home use, look for CADR ratings around 300 or higher for optimal air cleaning. 


### Power Consumption

Energy efficiency is crucial for cost-effective air purifier ownership. Some models consume less than 35 watts, while others use over 100 watts. The U. S. Energy Star program certifies efficient models that reduce both environmental impact and operating costs. 

![Cheap-Air-Purifier-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cheap-Air-Purifier-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Space Considerations

The room size determines the appropriate air purifier capacity. As a general rule, each purifier effectively cleans rooms up to 160 square feet. Larger rooms or spaces with poor ventilation may require multiple units or higher-rated models. 


## FAQ

![Cheap-Air-Purifier-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cheap-Air-Purifier-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What makes an air purifier "cheap"?

A cheap air purifier generally refers to models that offer solid performance at an affordable price point, often below $100 for tabletop units and $200 for room-sized models. These purifiers typically use basic filtration technologies like activated carbon or HEPA filters and may have fewer features than their premium counterparts. 

The key is finding a balance between budget and functionality. While entry-level models can effectively remove pollutants in small spaces, larger rooms might require more powerful units with additional features. 


### What should I consider when selecting a cheap air purifier?

When choosing a budget air purifier, focus on the CADR ratings for pollen and smoke, which measure clean air delivery rate. A CADR above 150 for both pollutants indicates adequate performance for most indoor spaces. 

Look for basic features like a washable pre-filter, activated carbon filter, and filter indicator light. Entry-level models typically lack smart connectivity, voice control, and multiple fan speeds found in more expensive options. 

![Cheap-Air-Purifier-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cheap-Air-Purifier-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Are cheap air purifiers effective?

Entry-level air purifiers can efficiently remove dust, pollen, and smoke particles from small rooms, making them suitable for personal offices, bedrooms, or apartments. They effectively reduce indoor air pollutants that cause allergy symptoms and poor air quality. 

While they perform well in smaller spaces, their efficiency decreases in larger rooms or in homes with significant pollutants. For comprehensive air purification, consider adding multiple units or opting for larger models. 


### How long do cheap air purifiers last?

Basic air purifiers designed for small spaces typically have a lifespan of 2-3 years with regular maintenance. The HEPA filter usually needs replacement every 6-12 months, while pre-filters may last up to 2 years depending on usage. 

After 3 years, performance significantly decreases, indicating the need for either a replacement unit or an upgrade to address changing indoor air quality needs. 

![Cheap-Air-Purifier-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cheap-Air-Purifier-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the main differences between cheap and expensive air purifiers?

Higher-end air purifiers feature advanced filtration systems like true HEPA filters, multi-stage purification, and activated carbon pre-filters. They often include additional features such as smart sensors, air quality indicators, and improved noise cancellation. 

Entry-level models typically use basic single-stage filtration and have fewer or no automated features, focusing instead on simple, reliable performance for small spaces. 


### Can cheap air purifiers handle strong odors?

Basic air purifiers with activated carbon filters can effectively reduce mild household odors, smoke, and pet smells. Their carbon filters adsorb volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and chemicals, making them useful for minor odor issues. 

For strong odors in larger spaces, especially with heavy smoking or chemical exposure, consider models with advanced carbon filtration or activated carbon beds that can handle higher concentrations of pollutants.
