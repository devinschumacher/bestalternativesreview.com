## Buyer's Guide

Lavanila Perfumes offer a delightful array of scents that blend natural elements with modern fragrance techniques. When selecting your perfect Lavanila scent, consider the following key aspects to ensure you find a fragrance that matches your preferences and needs. 


### Scarfidi's Artistry

Developed by Lorenzo Scarfidi, these fragrances marry natural ingredients with contemporary perfumery methods. The core ingredients often include aldehydic notes that create a modern foundation, which is then enhanced with natural essential oils for a distinctive character. 


### Essential Oils Profile

Each Lavanila fragrance incorporates essential oils that contribute to its distinct character. Common oils include bergamot, jasmine, and ylang-ylang, which create a fresh and floral base. Consider whether you prefer citrusy, floral, or woodsy notes in your fragrance. 


### Top Notes vs Base Notes

Understanding top, middle, and base notes will help you select a fragrance that suits your needs. Top notes are immediate and often the most distinctive. Middle notes form the heart of the fragrance and are most noticeable in the first few hours after application. Base notes provide lasting character and develop over time, lasting up to 24 hours. 


### Scent Strength and Lasting Power

Lavanila fragrances range from light and ephemeral to rich and enduring. If you prefer a subtle scent, opt for a fragrance with a higher proportion of natural ingredients. For a more lasting impression, consider a fragrance with a stronger concentration of essential oils. The container size also affects longevity, with larger bottles typically offering better value for money.
