## Buyer's Guide

Area rugs of size 10x14 add warmth and texture to any room while defining spatial zones. When selecting this size, consider the room's function and your specific needs. 


### Size and Proportion

This rug covers approximately 40 square feet, making it suitable for modest spaces or as a runner between rooms. It's large enough to anchor furniture but not so massive that smaller rooms feel overwhelmed. 


### MATERIAL AND QUALITY

Choose between natural fibers like wool or cotton for durability and comfort, or synthetic options for performance and easier maintenance. The quality of the backing also affects longevity and stability. 


### DESIGN AND PATTERN

Consider the rug's placement and ceiling height when selecting a pattern. In rooms with vaulted ceilings, large patterns work best, while small patterns suit lower ceilings. The design's orientation should complement your furniture layout. 


### CARE AND MAINTENANCE

Research the cleaning requirements of different materials and finishes. High-traffic areas may require stain-resistant treatments or thicker backs for added durability. Regular vacuuming and periodic professional cleaning extend the life of your rug.
