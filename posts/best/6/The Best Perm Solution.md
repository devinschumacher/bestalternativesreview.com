## Buyer's Guide

When selecting a perm solution, understanding key technical aspects will help you achieve salon-quality results at home. This guide outlines essential features and considerations to ensure your chosen product performs effectively. 


### Key Technical Specifications

Most perm solutions contain a base solution and a setting lotion. The base solution usually has a pH between 11 and 14, which opens the cuticle and penetrates the cortex. The setting lotion contains formaldehyde or other cross-linking agents that create curls. 

The developer strength affects how quickly the perm works, with 20-volume developer being the most common. Higher concentrations speed up reaction times but can damage hair if not used properly. 

![Perm-Solution-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Perm-Solution-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Additional Ingredients and Features

Look for added ingredients like hydrolyzed proteins, moisturizers, and antioxidants in the conditioning lotion. These protect hair from damage during and after the perm process. 

Solutions with aloe vera or vitamins provide extra hydration and nourishment. Avoid products containing sodium thioglycolate for sensitive scalps or damaged hair. 


### Process Considerations

Follow manufacturer instructions carefully regarding application and processing times. Typically, the full process takes 2-4 hours, including resting time. 

If you have fine or damaged hair, consider a half-perm technique to prevent breakage. Always create a protective wrap for the hair after applying the setting lotion. 

![Perm-Solution-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Perm-Solution-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### After-Care Requirements

Proper after-care is crucial for maintaining perm results. Use sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners, and avoid heat styling tools for several days after the perm. 

Regular trims every 6-8 weeks help maintain curl definition. Consider using curl-friendly products like leave-in conditioners and mists to enhance texture. 


## FAQ

![Perm-Solution-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Perm-Solution-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What exactly is a perm solution?

A perm solution is a chemical mixture designed to alter the natural curl pattern of hair by permanently changing its structure. This process involves applying specific products that break the natural bonds in the hair shaft, allowing the hair to be manipulated into a straighter style that lasts for months. 

The perm solution consists of two main components: the acidic lotion applied to the scalp to open the hair cuticle, and the perm wave solution applied to the hair shaft to initiate the chemical reaction that reshapes the hair structure. 


### Who is a good candidate for perms?

Perm solutions are suitable for individuals with naturally curly or wavy hair who want to achieve straighter, more manageable hair. People with fine or damaged hair should consult a professional before undergoing a perm, as the chemical process can be more intense for these hair types. 

Perms are not recommended for pregnant women, individuals with certain medical conditions affecting hair growth, or those with sensitive skin that may react negatively to chemical treatments. 

![Perm-Solution-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Perm-Solution-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How long does a perm last?

When done correctly, a perm typically lasts between 6 to 12 months, depending on the individual's hair type and care regimen. Regular perm maintenance, including proper shampooing and conditioning, can help extend the longevity of the style. 

After the initial perm, touch-ups every 2-4 months may be needed to maintain the desired level of straightness. The frequency of touch-ups depends on factors such as hair type, lifestyle, and environmental conditions. 


### What are the main components of a perm solution?

Perm solutions contain a combination of thioglycolic acid (TGA) and reducing agents that break the cystine bonds in the hair shaft. These components are applied in two parts: the acidic lotion neutralizes scalp pH, while the perm wave solution creates the desired change in hair structure. 

Professional perms often include additional components such as protective ingredients to shield the scalp, and smoothing agents to enhance the final result. The exact composition may vary between brands and salon professionals. 

![Perm-Solution-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Perm-Solution-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can anyone perform a perm at home?

Home perms using over-the-counter kits are available, but they carry higher risks of chemical burn and uneven results compared to professional perms. Home kits lack the protective measures and professional guidance available in salons. 

While experienced users can achieve satisfactory results with home perms, professionals recommend consulting a stylist to ensure safety, proper technique, and optimal results. The complexity and intensity of home perms make professional guidance highly advisable. 


### What are the potential risks of perms?

Common risks of perms include scalp irritation, allergic reactions to chemicals, and damage to the hair shaft from the strong chemicals used. These risks increase with the intensity of the perm and the quality of the products used. 

More severe complications can occur if perms are performed improperly or if the scalp is not adequately protected. These risks include permanent hair damage, chemical burns, and in rare cases, systemic toxicity from chemical absorption through the scalp.
