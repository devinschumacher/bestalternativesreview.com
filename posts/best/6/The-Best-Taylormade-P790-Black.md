## Buyer's Guide

The Taylormade P790 Black is a popular driver model that has gained attention from golfers worldwide. Understanding what makes this driver unique can help you make an informed decision about whether it's right for your game. 


### Head Design and Materials

The P790 features TaylorMade's UDOF (Unique Diamond Optics Face) engineered in black titanium. This design combines visual appeal with enhanced ball speed through a thin face and advanced cupping technology. The crown is machined from solid 6061 aluminum, offering durability while keeping weight low for improved forgiveness. 


### Dimension and Launch Characteristics

With a generous head size of 460cc, the P790 provides excellent launch conditions for golfers of all skill levels. The face angle appears slightly open from address, but the design encourages a square-to-fade ball flight. The low center of gravity and deep face promote maximum ball speed and consistent trajectories. 


### Performance Adjustments

Taylormade offers a free customization service that includes lofter angles and face setups. The 0.5° loft increment allows you to fine-tune your ball flight, while the two available face setups address different launch conditions. Proper fitting is crucial for optimizing this driver's performance potential. 


### Setup and Care Requirements

At 295 grams, the P790 is slightly heavier than some competitors, which may affect swing speed for slower players. The included shaft is a Project X HO 65, suitable for mid-to-high handicappers. Regular maintenance, including weekly cleaning and proper storage, will help preserve the driver's performance and appearance. 


## FAQ


### What makes the Taylormade P790 Black unique?

The P790 Black brings a dark, sleek look to Taylormade's P7 line. While maintaining the same advanced technology as other P7 irons, the Black version features a distinctive black PBR finish and blacked-out components for an eye-catching aesthetic. 

The PBR (Powdered Metal Casting) construction adds forgiveness and consistency to your iron shots without altering the traditional blade design that many players love about P7 irons. 


### How does the P790 Black compare to the regular P790?

The P790 Black shares the same engineering as the regular P790, offering the same level of performance through the set. The main difference is the visual appeal, with the black finish giving it a premium look that suits modern golf aesthetics. 

Both versions utilize similar cavity designs and weighting schemes that help with both forgiveness and perimeter weighting, making them effective choices for players looking to enhance their iron play. 


### What types of golfers will benefit most from the P790 Black?

Players who appreciate an iron design that combines traditional blade feel with modern forgiveness will find the P790 Black particularly rewarding. Its combination of traditional looks with advanced technologies makes it appealing to both intermediate and high-handicap golfers who want more reliable iron performance. 

The set's perimeter weighting and forged-appearant construction make it suitable for players who previously struggled with finding a forgiving iron design that maintained the feel of a blade iron. 


### What are the key specifications of the P790 Black?

The P790 Black maintains the same specifications as the regular P790, featuring 1025 forged-appearant stainless steel construction with dual milled faces. Each iron features a 45M face milled with V-grooves, while the backspear and soleplate maintain the signature Black PBR finish. 

The set includes a standard short iron configuration of 4 through PW, with each iron designed for perimeter weighting and enhanced impact performance through their milled faces and optimized leading edge designs. 


### How does the P790 Black perform in different playing conditions?

The P790 Black performs exceptionally well in various weather conditions due to its solid construction and reliable performance characteristics. The milled faces and perimeter weighting help maintain consistency through the set, reducing the impact of changing wind conditions and grass types. 

The black finish remains unaffected by weather conditions, ensuring consistent appearance and appeal regardless of environmental factors. 


### What service options are available for P790 Black irons?

Taylormade offers standard service options including setup, customization, and maintenance packages for the P790 Black set. The company's extensive network of fitters can help optimize the irons to your specific swing characteristics and preferences.
