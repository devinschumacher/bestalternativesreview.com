## Buyer's Guide

Foot stools offer additional comfort and support while offering a convenient way to adjust seating height. Whether you're using one at your desk, in the living room, or while cooking, understanding the key features and considerations can help you find the perfect stool for your space and needs. 


### Size and Proportion

Measure your available space to determine if the foot stool will fit comfortably under your chair or table. Consider the stool's dimensions relative to your furniture - it should be approximately one-quarter of your height. The seat depth should allow your feet to rest flat with knees at a 90-degree angle. 

![Foot-Stool-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Foot-Stool-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Stability and Base Design

The base is crucial for maintaining balance, especially if the stool doesn't have armrests. Look for wide, stable bases with multiple support points. The material of the base can affect both stability and cleaning requirements - metal and hardwood tend to be more durable than plastic. 


### Seat Materials and Comfort

Higher-quality foot stools use padded seats with foam cores, which provide better support than cushioned or inflatable types. Consider the seat's texture - memory foam or gel-infused padding offers customized comfort for different users. The surface material should be washable and match your room's aesthetic. 

![Foot-Stool-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Foot-Stool-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Additional Features

Some foot stools include functionality beyond basic support, such as height adjustment mechanisms, wheels for mobility, or built-in storage. Weight capacity varies significantly, from 150 to 300 pounds, so choose a stool rated for your intended user's weight. 


## FAQ

![Foot-Stool-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Foot-Stool-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a foot stool?

A foot stool is a small, portable seating piece designed to provide a comfortable raised surface for the feet. These compact pieces of furniture help reduce foot fatigue during seated activities and can improve posture and circulation. 

Foot stools come in various materials and styles, from simple wooden platforms to plush upholstered designs, allowing you to choose one that matches your room's aesthetics and functionality needs. 


### What sizes are available for foot stools?

Standard foot stools range in height from 12 to 18 inches, with diameters typically between 12 and 24 inches. These measurements accommodate both standard chair heights and personal comfort preferences. 

Some specialized designs, like ottoman-style foot stools, offer larger seating surfaces that extend beyond traditional footrest dimensions, providing additional leg room and storage options. 

![Foot-Stool-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Foot-Stool-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do you measure and choose the right foot stool size?

Measure the height of your chair and subtract 6 inches to determine the ideal stool height. This calculation ensures your feet rest comfortably on the stool while your knees form a 90-degree angle. 

 Consider the width of your chair and the space available around it when selecting a stool diameter. A good rule of thumb is to allow at least 10 inches between the edge of the chair seat and the stool's surface. 


### What materials are most suitable for foot stools?

Wood, especially hardwoods like oak or cherry, offers durability and classic styling for both indoor and outdoor use. It's ideal for stationary footrests in formal living spaces. 

Metallic finishes provide a sleek, modern option and are suitable for both indoor and outdoor environments. They're lightweight and available in various colors and designs, making them versatile for different interior styles. 

![Foot-Stool-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Foot-Stool-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can foot stools be used both indoors and outdoors?

While most foot stools are designed for indoor use, some manufacturers create weather-resistant options suitable for outdoor spaces. Always check the product specifications before purchasing for proper placement. 

Consider the material and finish when selecting an outdoor foot stool. Items made from plastic, metal, or weather-resistant fabrics can withstand outdoor elements while maintaining their appearance. 


### How should I care for my foot stool?

Regular maintenance includes dusting and occasional cleaning with a mild detergent solution. For wooden foot stools, apply furniture polish according to the manufacturer's instructions to maintain its finish. 

Check the stool's legs and base periodically for stability. Ensure all hardware is tight and the structure remains intact to prevent tipping or accidents.
