## Buyer's Guide

A Krups toaster combines everyday functionality with the convenience that modern kitchen appliances offer. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the perfect toaster for your needs. 


### Number of Slots

From single slot to wide open, toasters come in various configurations. Single slot toasters excel at toasting one piece of bread at a time, ideal for busy mornings or small apartments. Broad slot models accommodate thicker breads like bagels and English muffins, while dual slot options toast two slices simultaneously for speedier breakfasts. 


### Browning Control

Manual browning control allows you to adjust the toasting level from light to dark, perfect for achieving that perfectly crisp crust. Some models feature preset settings for bagels, English muffins, and other specialty breads, while more advanced toasters may include customizable options to save your preferred settings. 


### Convenience Features

Look for easy features that enhance your morning routine. Slide and stay slots keep your bread in place until you're ready to remove it, while cancel functions allow you to stop the toasting process before it's complete. Bread lifters help prevent burnt toast by automatically raising the bread when it's done, while crumb trays keep your toaster clean and your countertop tidy. 


### Cleanliness and Maintenance

Search for models with removable crumb trays for quick cleaning, and consider toasters with non-stick interiors that make cleanup easier. Some advanced models include automatic defrost settings that thaw frozen breads without additional preparation, while others feature cool-touch handles and facings to prevent burns during use.
