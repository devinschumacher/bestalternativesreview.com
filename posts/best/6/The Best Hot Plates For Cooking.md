For outdoor use, portability and weather resistance are crucial. For cooking specific foods, consider features like simmer controls or multiple burners for different cooking tasks. 


### How do I properly maintain a hot plate?

Regular cleaning is essential to prevent residue buildup. After each use, wipe down the cooking surface and remove any food particles or fuel residue. For deeper cleaning, use appropriate solvents or designated stove cleaners according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
