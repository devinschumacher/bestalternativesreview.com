## Buyer's Guide

Choosing the right soundbar can transform your viewing experience by delivering clear, immersive audio. Zvox soundbars offer several key features to consider when making your selection. 


### Audio Performance

Consider the soundbar's frequency response and total harmonic distortion to evaluate its audio quality.

Bluetooth connectivity allows for wireless mobile device pairing, while Wi-Fi enables multi-room audio or direct streaming from compatible devices. 


### Subwoofer Integration

Many Zvox soundbars include built-in subwoofer capabilities. Evaluate whether this integrated subwoofer provides sufficient bass or if you need an external subwoofer. Consider the subwoofer's placement options and its effect on overall system size and positioning. 


### Smart Features and Compatibility

Check if the soundbar supports smart features like Alexa, Google Assistant, or Bluetooth pairing. Ensure it's compatible with your operating system and other devices. Consider the user interface and whether it's intuitive to navigate, especially for smart features.
