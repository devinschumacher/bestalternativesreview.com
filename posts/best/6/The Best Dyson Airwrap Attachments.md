## FAQ

![Dyson-Airwrap-Attachments-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Dyson-Airwrap-Attachments-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What attachments come with a Dyson Airwrap?

The standard Dyson Airwrap comes with three attachments: a round brush, a barrel brush, and a diffuse nozzle. These attachments enable various styling options including blow-drying, smoothing, curling, and volume boost. 

Additional attachments can be purchased separately, including extensions for reaching high areas, a styling wand, and a detachable concentrator. 


### How do these attachments compare to non-Dyson alternatives?

Attachments from non-Dyson brands often require more frequent replacement due to wear and tear from multiple heat cycles. Dyson's engineered materials and manufacturing processes reportedly extend attachment lifespan and maintain consistent performance. 

Users report that Dyson attachments maintain their styling capabilities over time, whereas cheaper alternatives may lose their shape or effectiveness after repeated use. 

![Dyson-Airwrap-Attachments-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Dyson-Airwrap-Attachments-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can the attachments be used with other Dyson hair dryers?

No. The attachments are specifically designed for use with Dyson Airwrap and may not fit or work with other hair dryers, including other Dyson models. 

Attachments are made to work seamlessly with Airwrap's motor and heating elements for optimal performance and safety. 


### How should the attachments be cleaned?

Attachments can be removed and washed with mild soap and water. The barrel brush and round brush can be fully immersed in water for thorough cleaning. The diffuse nozzle should be removed from its base and cleaned separately. 

Always allow attachments to air dry completely before reattaching to the Dyson Airwrap. 

![Dyson-Airwrap-Attachments-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Dyson-Airwrap-Attachments-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How long do attachments typically last?

With regular use, Dyson attachments are expected to last for thousands of styling cycles, though actual lifespan varies based on usage frequency and proper care. 

The company recommends having one or two replacement sets on hand for peak performance, as attachments may need to be replaced after extensive use. 


### What is the best way to maintain attachments?

Attachments should be allowed to cool completely before cleaning to prevent damage to the heat-sensitive components. Regular maintenance includes removing any hair or debris between the inner surfaces of the attachments. 

If storing attachments, it's recommended to hand hold them rather than hanging them, which can potentially bend or damage the inner channels.
