## Buyer's Guide

Dune perfume has become a beloved classic in the world of fragrances, with its rich history and timeless appeal. Understanding what makes a Dune perfume worth considering can help you find the right scent for you.

### Heart Notes and Core Scent

Essential to Dune's character is its fusion of floral and woody notes. Expect either jasmine, rose, or neroli combined with sandalwood or patchouli. This heart of the fragrance should be complex enough to hold your interest but not overpowering. 


### Base Notes and Drydown

Sandalwood, vetiver, and moss typically form the base of Dune perfumes, providing depth and longevity. The drydown, or how the fragrance evolves after initial application, should offer a sophisticated finish that lasts throughout the day.
