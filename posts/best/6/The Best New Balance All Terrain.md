## Buyer's Guide

When selecting New Balance All Terrain footwear, consider several key factors to ensure you choose the right pair for your needs. Understanding these aspects will help you find shoes that balance comfort, durability, and performance for your specific terrain and activity level. 


### Footwear Construction and Materials

Sturdy upper materials like synthetic overlays and mesh ventilation panels provide both protection and breathability. Look for reinforced toe caps and heel counters for additional support during uneven terrain. The outsole composition, typically featuring rubber or dual-density compounds, determines traction and durability across various surfaces. 


### Level of Support and Stability

For runners and those needing extra support, mid to high-top models with reinforced stability features are suitable. Lower-cut options with strategic padding offer a balance of protection and flexibility for activities like walking or light hiking on well-maintained trails. 


### Weight and Cushioning

Performance-oriented users may prefer lighter shoes with responsive cushioning, while those prioritizing durability might opt for heavier-duty models with increased shock absorption. Consider the specific New Balance models' weight characteristics and their foam cushioning systems (e. g. , Fresh Foam, ABZORB). 


### Water Resistance and Weather Protection

Depending on your intended use, water resistance can be crucial. Some models feature Gore-Tex linings or waterproof membranes, while others prioritize breathability for moisture management. Pay attention to how the shoe seals around the edges and waterproof ratings if you'll be using them in wet conditions.
