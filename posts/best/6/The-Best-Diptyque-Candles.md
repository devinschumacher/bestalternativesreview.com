## Buyer's Guide

From richly spiced woods to fresh citrus blends, Diptyque candles transform living spaces with their evocative fragrances and expertly crafted designs. Choose the right candle for your room size and scent preference to create an ambient atmosphere that lasts. Consider factors like burn time, wick quality, and packaging when selecting your candle to ensure it matches both your aesthetic and practical needs. 


### Burn Time and Capacity

Diptyque candles typically offer generous burn times for their size, with larger formats providing more than 45 hours of light. Understanding a candle's capacity helps match it to your room size and desired fragrance intensity. Consider purchasing multiple smaller candles if you want to layer scents or create ambiance in multiple spaces.

### Scent Strength and Duration

Diptyque fragrances range from subtle accords to robust compostes, allowing you to choose a scent level that suits your preferences and space. Higher concentrations in limited editions may overpower smaller rooms, while signature blends like Jardin D'Amélie remain fresh for hours without becoming overwhelming. Consider whether you prefer immediate intensity or gradual development of fragrance notes. 


### Wick and Flame Quality

A quality wick burns cleanly without excess soot, while a steady flame ensures even melting of the wax. Diptyque candles typically feature cotton wicks treated with natural vegetable wax for optimal performance. The wax quality affects how the fragrance oils disperse, with premium waxes like the ones used in the Hiver collection producing especially pure scent profiles.

### Package Design and Protection

The iconic black and white packaging protects both the candle and its fragrance, especially important for sensitive scents like Peony or Gardenia. Look for sealed containers that prevent oxidation and maintain fragrance integrity. The packaging also serves as an elegant display piece, with larger formats often including decorative stands or boxes. 


## FAQ

![Diptyque-Candles-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Diptyque-Candles-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What makes Diptyque candles unique?

Diptyque's candles combine rich, complex fragrances with premium craftsmanship. Each blend features a dual-wick design that ensures even burning and lasts twice as long as traditional candles. 

The French brand sources premium ingredients and hand-pours each candle in their Paris workshop, combining centuries of expertise with modern scent formulations. 


### What are the key fragrances to try?

Start with La Mazarine - a classic blend of sandalwood, patchouli, and vanilla. For something new, try Aventus, a sophisticated men's fragrance combining coriander, cinnamon, and jasmine. 

Popular women's scents include Jardin D'Orient (jasmine, rose, and patchouli) and Bois de Santorin (cedarwood, bergamot, and sandalwood). 

![Diptyque-Candles-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Diptyque-Candles-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How should I store my Diptyque candle?

Store candles in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat sources. This helps maintain their quality and extend their lifespan. 

Avoid touching or scratching the surface as it can affect the burning process and lead to black soot build-up. 


### What's the proper way to burn a Diptyque candle?

Allow the wax to melt completely across the entire surface during the first burn. This typically takes 1-2 hours, establishing a proper "memory" for even burning. 

Always trim the wick to 1/4 inch before each use. Extinguish the flame when 1/2 inch of wax remains to prevent smoking and soot. 

![Diptyque-Candles-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Diptyque-Candles-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How long do Diptyque candles last?

Each 330g candle provides approximately 40-50 hours of burn time, depending on room temperature and air circulation. The premium formula burns twice as long as standard candles of similar size. 

To make your candle last longer, avoid drafts and burn for longer intervals each session rather than multiple short sessions. 


### Can I reuse the glass after burning?

Yes, once your candle is completely extinguished, you can reuse the glass. The brand recommends removing any remaining wax and thoroughly cleaning the glass before reuse. 

Alternatively, you can purchase Diptyque's glass recycling program, which allows you to return used glasses in exchange for gift cards.
