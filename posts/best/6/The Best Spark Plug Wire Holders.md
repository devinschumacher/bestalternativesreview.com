### What is a spark plug wire holder?

A spark plug wire holder is a specialized clip or holder designed to secure high-tension spark plug wires in position on an engine. These holders prevent wire tangling, improve airflow around the engine, and protect the wires from damage. 

They are typically made from metal with insulating properties, ensuring they don't conduct electricity while securely gripping the spark plug wires.
