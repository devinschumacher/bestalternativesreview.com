## FAQ

### What makes the Bissell Spotclean Proheat different from other handheld vacuums?

The Bissell Spotclean Proheat combines powerful suction with steam cleaning technology for deep cleaning capabilities. Unlike traditional handheld vacuums, it's designed specifically for quick spot cleaning without the need for attachments. 

Its steam feature helps remove up to 99.9% of bacteria and viruses, making it ideal for cleaning pet messes, allergen sources, and difficult-to-clean areas. The hot water extraction system also helps prevent residue typically left by other steam cleaners. 


### How much water does the Spotclean Proheat hold, and how long does it last?

The unit holds 26 ounces of water, which provides about 5 minutes of steam cleaning time per fill. This allows for deep cleaning of multiple areas before needing to refill. 

After using the steam feature, the vacuum can operate normally on suction for about 60 minutes with a single 12-volt car battery charge. The water reservoir needs to be empty before recharging to prevent any leakage issues. 

![Bissell-Spotclean-Proheat-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Bissell-Spotclean-Proheat-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can the Spotclean Proheat clean both carpet and hard floors effectively?

Yes, the Spotclean Proheat is suitable for both carpeted and hard floor surfaces. It handles carpet depths up to 1.5 inches and is great for quick hard floor cleaning between professional services. 

For deep carpet cleaning, users should use the steam feature followed by a normal suction clean. Hard floors require only the suction mode for best results, maintaining the integrity of the floor surface. 


### What maintenance is required for the Bissell Spotclean Proheat?

The system requires basic maintenance including emptying the dirt cup after each use, cleaning the water tank and filter monthly, and checking the nozzle for blockages regularly. 

Each component has specific cleaning instructions included in the manual. Regular maintenance prevents clogs and ensures both the steam system and suction power remain at optimal performance levels.

The Spotclean Proheat offers more versatile cleaning capabilities than previous Bissell steam mops. It's smaller and more portable, making it suitable for quick cleanups in various situations. 

While other Bissell steam cleaners focus on floor cleaning, the Spotclean Proheat combines steam with powerful suction for pet hair removal, allergen reduction, and thorough cleaning in tight spaces. 


### What accessories are included with the Bissell Spotclean Proheat?

The unit comes with a dusting brush attachment for reaching into crevices and a pet hair tool for targeted pet hair removal. These accessories are specifically designed to work with the vacuum's motor and steam system. 

For pet owners, the included attachments make it easier to maintain a clean home environment. The vacuum's compact design allows these accessories to be stored easily when not in use.
