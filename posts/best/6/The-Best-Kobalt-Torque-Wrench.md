## Buyer's Guide

A torque wrench is a precision tool used to achieve specific torque values when tightening bolts and nuts. The Kobolt brand offers several types of torque wrenches, each designed for different applications and environments. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you choose the right tool for your needs. 


### Accuracy and Calibration

Look for a torque wrench with consistent accuracy across its range. Calibrated torque wrenches should indicate their measurement accuracy (e. g. , +/- 4% or +/- 6%). Regular calibration is essential, especially for professional use, to maintain precision. 


### Torque Capacity and Range

Consider the maximum torque capacity of the wrench in relation to your application. Common capacities range from 10 to 1,000 Nm. The range should allow for multiple settings within a broad application scope. 


### Design and Construction

High-quality torque wrenches have robust construction, typically featuring durable materials like chromed-vanadium steel. The mechanism should offer smooth operation with precise click indicators or color-coded displays for correct torque application. 


### Compatibility and Applications

Evaluate the wrench's compatibility with your existing tools and workspace. Some models are compatible with extension bars and universal joints for versatile use. Think about the environments where the wrench will be used - automotive, construction, or maintenance - to select a design optimized for your specific needs. 


## FAQ


### What is a Kobalt torque wrench?

A Kobalt torque wrench is a precision tool designed for measuring and controlling torque during fastener tightening. Unlike standard wrenches, it allows you to set a specific torque value, ensuring that bolts and screws are tightened to the correct specification. 

These wrenches feature a calibrated mechanism that locks when the preset torque is reached, preventing over-tightening which can damage parts or strip threads. The feedback from the wrench indicates when the correct torque has been achieved. 


### How accurate are Kobalt torque wrenches?

Kobalt torque wrenches typically feature a calibration accuracy of ±3% of the indicated torque setting. This means that if you set the wrench to 50 ft-lbs, it will maintain torque within a range of 47-53 ft-lbs. 

The accuracy comes from their mechanical linkage system that converts your hand force into precise torque output. Regular calibration using a known torque device can maintain this accuracy over time. 


### What are the different types of Kobalt torque wrenches?

Kobalt offers several types of torque wrenches including click-type, click-lock, and torque-indicating styles. Click-type wrenches lock at the preset torque with a distinct click, while click-lock types indicate the torque with multiple clicks. Torque-indicating wrenches display a visual indicator when the torque is reached. 

There are also variants for different applications such as impact-resistant models, premium series with higher torque capacity, and specialized styles for metric or imperial measurements. 


### What is the warranty on Kobalt torque wrenches?

Kobalt offers a standard one-year warranty on their torque wrenches. This covers defects in materials and workmanship under normal use. The warranty is voided by misuse, modification, or failure to follow the manufacturer's operating instructions. 

Customers can extend the warranty through third-party programs, and Kobalt provides replacement batteries for electronic models under their limited warranty conditions. 


### What are the pros and cons of Kobalt torque wrenches?

Pros: High accuracy, durable construction, clear torque indicators, and competitive pricing for the value offered. The wrenches are reliable for both professional and DIY users who need precise torque control. 

Cons: Higher initial cost compared to open-end wrenches, single-torque models cannot measure different settings, and require regular maintenance for accurate readings. The specialized mechanism may be more susceptible to damage from extreme drops or impacts. 


### How should I maintain my Kobalt torque wrench?

Regularly check the torque setting mechanism and locking mechanism for proper function. Perform a zero check before each use to ensure the wrench reads zero when not under load. 

After use, clean the wrench and store it in a dry place to prevent corrosion. Lubricate the mechanism every six months to maintain smooth operation, and calibrate annually or after significant drops/impacts to maintain accuracy.
