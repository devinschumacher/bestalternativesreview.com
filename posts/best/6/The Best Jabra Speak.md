### Connectivity Options

Standard models support Bluetooth and USB connectivity, with some featuring integrated Wi-Fi. Look for models with multiple device pairing capabilities and fast connection times. Indoor and outdoor versions vary in their specific connectivity options, so check compatibility with your devices.

## FAQ

![Jabra-Speak-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Jabra-Speak-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What makes Jabra Speak different from other Bluetooth speakers?

Jabra specializes in audio equipment designed for clear, balanced sound across a wide frequency range. Their speakers, including the Jabra Speak series, feature advanced audio processing that minimizes distortion and background noise, ensuring your music and calls are crystal clear. 

Unlike many consumer Bluetooth speakers that prioritize bass response, Jabra focuses on maintaining natural sound quality even at higher volumes. This is particularly beneficial for voice communication, where intelligibility is crucial. 


### How does Jabra's voice isolation technology work?

Through carefully tuned acoustic design and digital signal processing, Jabra's voice isolation technology maintains strong call quality while significantly reducing ambient noise. This allows you to be heard clearly by the other party without interference from your environment. 

The system works bidirectionally - it enhances the clarity of your voice when making calls and simultaneously minimizes background noise to ensure your surroundings don't affect the call quality.

Yes, Jabra Speak is designed for versatile use. Whether you're listening to music, taking calls, or streaming audio, the system delivers consistent performance across all these use cases. The speaker can automatically adjust between call mode and music mode based on the source content.

The typical Bluetooth range for Jabra Speak is around 30 feet (9 meters) indoors and slightly less outdoors. This means you can move up to 30 feet away from your phone while maintaining a stable connection. 

At the 30-foot mark, the connection may become inconsistent, especially in areas with obstacles or interference. For optimal performance, keep the speaker within 15 feet of your phone when possible.
