The Coleman Skydome 4-person tent packs impressive weather resistance into a surprisingly roomy package. With its nearly vertical walls offering 20% more headroom than traditional Coleman dome tents, it provides a generous 8 feet by 3.5 feet of standing space. The full-fly vestibule adds valuable storage while keeping you dry, though some might find the mesh sides a bit less than ideal for cooler evenings. Setting up this tent is a breezeâ€”officially just under 5 minutes with the pre-attached polesâ€”but like many popular gear items, the convenience comes with minor compromises, like a slightly cumbersome pole attachment system.

## FAQ


### What makes the Coleman Sundome 4 unique?

The Sundome 4's distinctive hemispherical dome shape provides superior ventilation and natural light distribution. This design helps keep the tent cooler in summer and warmer in winter compared to traditional rectangular tents. 

Features like the adjustable rainfly, aluminum pole system, and vestibules make it versatile for various camping conditions and activities. The tent also offers generous space for four people, with plenty of storage options outside the main living area. 


### How difficult is it to set up?

The Sundome 4 uses Coleman's Streamline pole system, making setup quick and simple. The included color-coded poles and clear assembly instructions help even first-time campers set up efficiently. 

Setup typically takes about 15-20 minutes with one person, or less if you're two or more working together. The poles and floor system click into place easily, requiring minimal force to assemble. 


### What materials are used in the construction?

The main body of the Sundome 4 is constructed from 1200D polyester with a water-resistant coating, designed to withstand typical camping conditions. The rainfly is made from 2000mm polyurethane-coated polyester, providing effective water protection. 

The floor is 600D polyester with a 1500mm waterproof rating, while the door fly features a 1500mm rating for additional protection at the entrances. All materials are tested for durability and tear strength. 


### How much does it weigh?

The Coleman Sundome 4 weighs 22 pounds (10kg) with poles and stakes included. This makes it moderately heavy compared to some ultralight camping options, but still manageable for most weekend trips. 

The tent's weight is evenly distributed between the main body (10.5 lbs/4.7kg) and the rainfly (7.5 lbs/3.4kg). The pole set and stakes account for the remaining 4 lbs (1.8kg). 


### What's the recommended weight capacity?

The Sundome 4 is designed to handle loads up to 330 pounds (150kg) when fully packed. However, the weight capacity for camping use is generally recommended to be between 250-300 pounds to allow for proper ventilation and stability. 

For optimal performance, the total weight of the tent, gear, and occupants should not exceed 330 pounds. This includes all gear stored inside or outside the tent, as well as any additional items brought along. 


### How do the vestibules work?

The Sundome 4 comes with two vestibules, one at each end of the tent. These spaces provide covered storage for boots, shoes, or other gear, keeping everything dry and accessible. 

Each vestibule has its own compression strap system that allows you to secure items while minimizing space taken inside the main tent. The vestibules can each hold about 15-20 cubic feet of gear, depending on the specific items stored.
