## Buyer's Guide

When selecting a toilet, consider factors that affect comfort, hygiene, and environmental impact. Key aspects include bowl shape, flush mechanism, water efficiency, and seating height. 


### Flush Mechanism and Efficiency

Toilets vary in their flush mechanisms, from simple one-button designs to more complex dual-flush systems. Consider a tankless or power-assist toilet for reduced water usage without compromising cleaning power. The flush volume should reliably clean the bowl while using minimal water. 

![Proflo-Toilet-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Proflo-Toilet-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Bowls and Seating

The toilet bowl shape affects both comfort and ease of cleaning. Curved bowls are generally more hygienic and easier to keep clean than straight bowls. The seat height should accommodate users of all ages and physical abilities - standard height seats range from 14 inches to 18 inches in height. 


### Water Supply and Connections

Ensure the toilet's water supply connection matches your existing pipes. Standard connections are 1-1/2 inches in diameter. The toilet's base width should also fit within your floor space - typical bases range from 12 to 14 inches wide. 

![Proflo-Toilet-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Proflo-Toilet-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Waste Venting and Installation

The toilet's waste outlet size must match your home's drain pipe standard, usually 3 inches. Consider the distance between the toilet and the vent stack - toilets with offset waste outlets can be installed closer to walls. Some toilets are designed for rough-in distances of 10 inches, while others require 12 or 14 inches.
