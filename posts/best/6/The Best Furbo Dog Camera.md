## Buyer's Guide

Understanding key features and requirements will help you select the right Furbo Dog Camera to meet your pet's monitoring and interaction needs. This guide highlights essential aspects to consider when choosing the perfect camera for your furry friend. 


### Camera Functionality and Image Quality

When selecting a Furbo Dog Camera, prioritize clear video quality and smooth streaming capabilities. Look for options with at least 1080p resolution and reliable wireless connectivity (Wi-Fi). Some models offer features like two-way audio, which allows you to communicate with your pet, while others may include night vision capabilities for monitoring after dark. 


### Size and Placement

Size compatibility with your pet's space is crucial. The camera should be small enough to avoid obstructing the pet's view but robust enough to prevent accidental knocks or bumps. Consider models with adjustable stands or wall-mounting options to position the camera at an appropriate height inside or outside your home. 


### Battery and Power Requirements

Power management is essential for continuous monitoring. While wired power is ideal for indoor cameras, battery-operated units that can last 12-24 hours between charges are convenient for outdoor placement. Some advanced models offer USB-C charging for quick resupply and extended backup batteries. 


### Pricing and Subscription Costs

Initial camera cost isn't the only expense to consider. Basic models range from $100 to $200, while advanced features often require additional investment. Subscription services for remote viewing can add $9.99 to $24.99 per month, depending on the features you choose. Evaluate whether the camera's capabilities justify the subscription cost for your specific needs. 


## FAQ


### What features does the Furbo Dog Camera offer?

The Furbo camera combines a suite of features that help keep your dog safe and entertained when you're away. It includes a high-definition camera with two-way audio, treat-dispensing functionality, and a built-in water bottle. 

The camera also features facial recognition technology that lets you greet your dog by name and automatically alerts you when your pet approaches the camera. The app tracks your dog's daily activity, including playtime and rest periods. 


### How does the Furbo camera improve indoor pet security?

The camera's 1080p HD video stream and two-way audio allow you to check on your pet and talk to them in real-time. The pet-focused facial recognition feature ensures you're alerted to your pet's presence without unnecessary alerts for other household members. 

The camera's motion detection and night vision capabilities help monitor your pet's activity when you're not home, and the app provides detailed activity logs to help you understand your pet's behavior patterns. 


### Does the Furbo camera require a monthly subscription?

The basic camera functionality operates without a subscription, including viewing, talking, and pet monitoring features. However, access to additional services like cloud storage for recordings and enhanced motion detection requires a monthly subscription. 

You can choose between different subscription plans based on your specific needs, with options for daily, weekly, or monthly recordings. 


### How easy is it to set up the Furbo camera?

Setting up the Furbo camera is generally straightforward with the companion app guiding you through the process. You'll need to download the app, connect to Wi-Fi, and configure your preferences, including camera settings and notification preferences. 

The app walks you through each step, and you can customize features like camera angle, motion detection sensitivity, and audio volume to suit your needs. 


### What are the battery requirements for the Furbo camera?

The camera itself runs on a long-lasting lithium-ion battery that provides continuous power for the camera functions. The app reminders will notify you when it's time to replace the battery, which typically lasts 1-2 years depending on usage. 

The water bottle and treat-dispenser functions require a separate power source, which you can purchase through the official Furbo store to maintain uninterrupted functionality. 


### Can the Furbo camera work with my existing home security system?

The Furbo camera can work alongside most home security systems through the app's integration features. You can set up notifications to be sent to both your phone and your security system control panel when the camera detects motion. 

However, direct integration with all security systems is not guaranteed, so it's recommended to check compatibility with your existing system before purchase.
