## Buyer's Guide

Softball sunglasses combine protective performance with stylish design, essential for athletes who spend hours in the sun. Understanding key aspects of these eyewear essentials can help you select a pair that enhances your game while keeping your eyes safe and comfortable. 


### UV Protection

Sunglasses must block 99-100% of both UVA and UVB rays to prevent eye damage. Look for lenses with a UV400 label or lenses that are explicitly marked as providing complete UV protection.

### Lens Options

Standard yellow lenses increase visibility of the ball and surroundings, while amber lenses reduce glare. Photochromic lenses automatically adjust to changing light conditions, and polarized lenses minimize reflective glare from surfaces like dirt or uniform fabrics. 


### Frame Durability

Sports sunglasses need robust frames that resist bending and snapping under impact. Choose frames made from durable materials like stainless steel or high-quality plastic blends, with secure nose grips and earpieces to prevent sliding.

### Fit and Comfort

Proper fit prevents movement and discomfort during play. Adjust temples to maintain a secure, non-sliding fit, and ensure the frame comfortably stays above the eyebrows without pressing. Temporal lenses should sit flat on the cheeks to block side glare.
