While browsing for a stylish square coffee table, take into account the following features: materials used, build quality, size and dimensions, height, and the overall design of the table. Seek tables with robust, well-crafted construction and high-quality materials to guarantee durability and longevity. Consider the size and dimensions of the table to ensure a perfect fit for your space and the appropriate amount of legroom. The table's height should also be compatible with your seating arrangements for comfort.

### How should I clean and maintain my new, stylish square coffee table?

To keep your new chic square coffee table in pristine condition, follow these steps: 
1) Regularly dust the table using a soft, dry cloth or a feather duster to keep it free of dust. 2) For spills, use a damp cloth to wipe them up promptly, being careful not to soak the surface. 3) Avoid using abrasive cleaners, which can scratch the surface. Instead, use mild soap and water or a furniture cleaner designed explicitly for the table's material. 

For wooden tables, it is recommended to apply a finish or sealant to protect the wood from spills and stains. Additionally, consider using a furniture wax to give the table a polished appearance. Always read the manufacturer's instructions for specific care and cleaning recommendations.
