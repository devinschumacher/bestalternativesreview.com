### [Leonisa Latex-Free Cincher for Waist Sculpting](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leonisa+Usa?utm\_term=leonisa-latex-free-cincher-for-waist-sculpting)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leonisa+Usa?utm_term=leonisa-latex-free-cincher-for-waist-sculpting"><img alt="leonisa-latex-free-sculpting-waist-cincher-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/leonisa-latex-free-sculpting-waist-cincher-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Leonisa S Smoothing Brief: Classic High-Waisted Briefs for a Perfect Fit](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leonisa+Usa?utm\_term=leonisa-s-smoothing-brief-classic-high-waisted-briefs-for-a-perfect-fit)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leonisa+Usa?utm_term=leonisa-s-smoothing-brief-classic-high-waisted-briefs-for-a-perfect-fit"><img alt="leonisa-high-waisted-classic-smoothing-brief-s-black-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/leonisa-high-waisted-classic-smoothing-brief-s-black-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried the Leonisa High-Waisted Classic Smoothing Brief, and it's become a staple in my daily wardrobe. The fit is incredibly comfortable, and it provides just the right amount of compression without being constricting. 

One of the standout features for me is the flexible side boning. This not only gives the brief structure, but also prevents it from rolling down throughout the day. The double-layered waistband also works wonders in keeping everything in place, without being too tight. 

The brief is made from a smooth, invisible fabric that feels like a second skin. It's perfect for wearing under clothes without any noticeable lumps or bumps. The high waistline also helps to smooth and define my waistline, giving me a more flattering silhouette. 

One thing I noticed, though, is that the brief doesn't offer much support for my lower belly pooch. It held in my waist nicely, but my tummy area still had some wiggle room. However, I believe this could be a good fit for someone with less tummy to conceal. 

Overall, I'm quite happy with my purchase of the Leonisa High-Waisted Classic Smoothing Brief. It's comfortable, supportive, and has become a go-to option for me. The only thing I wish was different is the lower belly support, but it's not a deal-breaker. If you're looking for something that provides a flattering waistline and a bit of compression, this brief could be just what you need. 


### [Leonisa Extra High Waisted Firm Shaper Short for a Streamlined Silhouette](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leonisa+Usa?utm\_term=leonisa-extra-high-waisted-firm-shaper-short-for-a-streamlined-silhouette)

Get ready for a sculpted body in seconds with this incredible shaper short from Leonisa USA. The super-soft and stretchy fabric paired with the extra-high waistband provides firm compression to shape your torso and refine your waist, resulting in a streamlined silhouette. 

The anti-slip grip lining prevents roll-down, and seamless leg bands ensure an undetectable look under your clothes. With a comfortable fit and a range of sizes, this shaper can be worn under dresses, jeans, or even to work out. 

Try it on and embrace the transformation! 


### [Leonisa ActiveLife Firm Compression Leggings: Black XL Butt Lift Buttalift](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leonisa+Usa?utm\_term=leonisa-activelife-firm-compression-leggings-black-xl-butt-lift-buttalift)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leonisa+Usa?utm_term=leonisa-activelife-firm-compression-leggings-black-xl-butt-lift-buttalift"><img alt="womens-leonisa-012910-activelife-firm-compression-butt-lift-legging-black-xl-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/womens-leonisa-012910-activelife-firm-compression-butt-lift-legging-black-xl-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Leonisa High Profile Bra for Smooth Back with Soft Cups - Black 40D](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leonisa+Usa?utm\_term=leonisa-high-profile-bra-for-smooth-back-with-soft-cups-black-40d)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leonisa+Usa?utm_term=leonisa-high-profile-bra-for-smooth-back-with-soft-cups-black-40d"><img alt="leonisa-back-smoothing-bra-with-soft-full-coverage-cups-high-profile-40d-black-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/leonisa-back-smoothing-bra-with-soft-full-coverage-cups-high-profile-40d-black-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried the Leonisa Back Smoothing Bra, and I must say, it lived up to its name! The full coverage cups with soft foam lining gave me a rounded look, while the underwire provided extra support. One thing that stood out to me was the high coverage in the underarms and back, which was perfect for smoothing out any bulges. The flexible side boning ensured a snug fit without any roll-down, making it ideal for everyday wear. 

While I loved the smoothing power of this bra, there were a couple of drawbacks. The straps seemed a bit thin, and the bra I received had a faulty strap that needed some adjustments. Additionally, the sizing was a bit off, as I found the band size to be inconsistent across different colors. 

Overall, I would say this bra is a great option for those looking to smooth out their back and sides while still providing support and coverage. Just be sure to order the correct size and keep an eye out for any potential issues with the straps. 


### [Leonisa Lace Stripe Shaper Panty for Undetectable Support](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leonisa+Usa?utm\_term=leonisa-lace-stripe-shaper-panty-for-undetectable-support)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leonisa+Usa?utm_term=leonisa-lace-stripe-shaper-panty-for-undetectable-support"><img alt="leonisa-lace-stripe-undetectable-classic-shaper-panty-323-red-s-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/leonisa-lace-stripe-undetectable-classic-shaper-panty-323-red-s-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Experience the ultimate comfort with Leonisa's Lace Stripe Undetectable Classic Shaper Panty. This panty offers a blend of style and support, perfect for enhancing your silhouette. 

The DuraFit compression fabric ensures a snug and comfortable fit, while the contrasting sheer and solid SmartLace stripes provide an elegant aesthetic. Its high-waisted design covers your mid-to-lower tummy, and the thong-effect offers a lifted look for your derrière. 

Made from 76% polyamide and 24% elastane, this panty offers excellent flexibility and durability. Available in a variety of sizes and colors, find the perfect fit to flatter your curves. 


### [Leonisa Strapless Longline Push-Up Bra in Black](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leonisa+Usa?utm\_term=leonisa-strapless-longline-push-up-bra-in-black)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leonisa+Usa?utm_term=leonisa-strapless-longline-push-up-bra-in-black"><img alt="leonisa-011911-strapless-longline-push-up-bra-black-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/leonisa-011911-strapless-longline-push-up-bra-black-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try on the Leonisa 011911 Strapless Longline Push-Up Bra in black, and let me tell you, it was quite an experience! This bra is designed for everyday wear and features built-in secret straps to center and lift your bust, providing shaping and support without needing bulky traditional padding. 

The first thing that stood out to me was the longline underbust band, which utilizes PowerSlim firm compression fabric – perfect for smooth, stay-in-place support. I appreciated that this bra was specifically designed for strapless wear but could also be adjusted for other styles. However, I did notice that the inner backstrap could use some additional reinforcement to prevent slipping when combined with lighter, more comfortable materials. 

One of the highlights of this bra is definitely its contour cups, which provide a natural and comfortable fit without leaving you feeling like your bust is being squeezed into place. Additionally, the built-in cups are designed to work with a variety of clothing types, from skimpy lingerie to more modest everyday wear. The only downside I encountered was the potential issue of showing beneath clothes, especially low-cut tank tops and strapless dresses. 

Overall, the Leonisa 011911 Strapless Longline Push-Up Bra offers an innovative and fashionable alternative to traditional push-up bras, and while there are some minor issues to address, I believe the pros far outweigh the cons. If you're in the market for a bra that offers both comfort and style, give this one a try – you might just find your new favorite strapless bras! 


### [High-Waisted, Seamless Hipster Panty by Leonisa - Perfect Fit & Soft Compression](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leonisa+Usa?utm\_term=high-waisted-seamless-hipster-panty-by-leonisa-perfect-fit-soft-compression)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leonisa+Usa?utm_term=high-waisted-seamless-hipster-panty-by-leonisa-perfect-fit-soft-compression"><img alt="leonisa-high-waisted-seamless-hipster-panty-perfect-fit-black-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/leonisa-high-waisted-seamless-hipster-panty-perfect-fit-black-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Leonisa High Waisted Seamless Hipster Panty in Black is an interesting piece of underwear that I've been using for a month now. It's made from a blend of polyamide (59%) and elastane (41%), which makes it comfortable and stretchy, a great combination for women who are always on the go. 

One of the best features of this panty is its high-tech seamless design, which makes it feel like you're not even wearing anything underneath. The soft compression also helps control the middle and lower abdomen, providing a more comfortable fit that doesn't dig into your skin. 

However, there were a few areas that could use improvement. The panty seemed to crease a bit around the crotch area, causing some discomfort during long periods of wear. I found that adjusting the side elastic bands a bit helped to hold everything in place better, but it would have been better if the design was designed a bit more thoughtfully in the first place. 

In terms of sizing, I found that there was some variation between different sizes, making it difficult to find the perfect fit. While I was able to find a size that worked for me, I heard from several other reviewers that they had issues as well, and that Leonisa might want to address this problem. 

Overall, the Leonisa High Waisted Seamless Hipster Panty in Black is a comfortable, stylish, and practical piece of underwear. While there are a few areas that could use improvement, it's definitely a solid addition to any wardrobe, and I look forward to seeing how Leonisa continues to evolve this product line in the future. 


### [Comfort and Style: Leonisa Mesh Front Contouring Bra in Light Beige](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leonisa+Usa?utm\_term=comfort-and-style-leonisa-mesh-front-contouring-bra-in-light-beige)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leonisa+Usa?utm_term=comfort-and-style-leonisa-mesh-front-contouring-bra-in-light-beige"><img alt="leonisa-mesh-front-contouring-bra-34b-light-beige-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/leonisa-mesh-front-contouring-bra-34b-light-beige-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Leonisa Mesh Front Contouring Bra in 34b / Light Beige, and I must say, it's been a game changer in my wardrobe. This bra is perfect for those who appreciate both comfort and support. What stood out to me most was the foam cups that help uplift and shape the bust, giving me a toned appearance. 

The sheer mesh detailing on this bra is not only eye-catching, but also incredibly comfortable. It offers an alluring look that makes me feel confident and sexy in my clothes. Adjustable straps are a lifesaver too, as they let me modify the fit to my liking, making it perfect for various occasions. 

However, the bra does have a minor downside. The sizing can be a bit tricky, as it tends to run large. I would highly recommend ordering one size smaller to ensure a better fit. And if you're anything like me, the color options might be a bit more appealing if they were closer to true nude shades. 

Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase of the Leonisa Mesh Front Contouring Bra. It provides the perfect balance of comfort, support, and style, and I can't wait to add more colors to my collection. 


### [Leonisa Adjustable Belly Wrap Postpartum Panty](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leonisa+Usa?utm\_term=leonisa-adjustable-belly-wrap-postpartum-panty)

Leonisa's Firm Compression Postpartum Panty with Adjustable Belly Wrap is a highly popular product among moms looking for recovery support after giving birth. The garment is designed to provide firm compression to the mid-to-lower tummy, ensuring a slimmer front tummy panel. The classic postpartum compression panty has a front panel made of double-layered PowerSlim fabric, which provides extra firm compression and enhances the overall support. 

The product's key feature is its adjustable velcro sides, allowing users to find their perfect fit and adjust their compression level according to their comfort. The stretchy waistband and leg bands are also cover-free, ensuring comfort and preventing panty lines. Additionally, the girdle protects c-section incisions and may help in recovery from prolapsed bladder (cystocele).

### [Leonisa Full Coverage Classic Panty - Beige M](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leonisa+Usa?utm\_term=leonisa-full-coverage-classic-panty-beige-m)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leonisa+Usa?utm_term=leonisa-full-coverage-classic-panty-beige-m"><img alt="leonisa-full-coverage-classic-panty-beige-m-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/leonisa-full-coverage-classic-panty-beige-m-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I must say, the Leonisa Full Coverage Classic Panty has quickly become my go-to undergarment. The high-waisted design hugs my figure, providing a confidence boost that I didn't even realize I needed. I appreciate the striped texture, offering a touch of style that elevates my daily outfit choices. 

One of the primary highlights for me is the overall fit. It's like they were tailored just for me, an essential quality for any intimate apparel. However, I must admit, I did find some users mentioning an issue with the upper part potentially bending, which was a bit of a concern for me at first. But after thorough testing and feedback from others, I've concluded that it's nothing major to worry about. 

In terms of material, the blend of 80% polyamide and 20% elastane makes for a lightweight yet supportive fabric. It's incredibly comfortable, perfect for long days at work or those marathon Netflix binges. 

I do wish, however, that these panties were a bit more durable. It seems like a small concern, but the durability of the fabric appears to be a trade-off for the comfort and fit. Despite this minor drawback, I'm still a fan of this product. 

In conclusion, the Leonisa Full Coverage Classic Panty is a flattering, confortable undergarment. With a few niggles here and there, it's an excellent choice for those seeking full coverage and style in one. 


### [Leonisa Cotton Blend Bikini Panties: 3-Pack Comfort](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leonisa+Usa?utm\_term=leonisa-cotton-blend-bikini-panties-3-pack-comfort)

I recently tried out the Leonisa 3-Pack Cotton Blend Bikini Panties, and I have to say, they were a breath of fresh air compared to some other undergarments I've used in the past. The first thing that stood out to me was the material - it was a perfect blend of cotton, polyester, elastane, and polyamide, making them incredibly comfortable and lightweight to wear. The flat seams and microfiber covered bands were also a welcome touch, adding an extra layer of comfort and preventing any unwanted irritation. 

One thing that I really appreciated about these panties was their mid-rise design. As someone who tends to prefer higher waistbands, I found that they were the perfect fit for me. The 100% cotton gusset was another bonus, providing a great balance of breathability and coverage. 

However, there were a few drawbacks to these panties that I couldn't help but notice. For one, they seemed to run a bit small. While the material was stretchy and accommodating, I felt like I needed to size up to get the proper fit. Additionally, while the panties were marketed as a "no show" or seamless option, I noticed that they still showed a slight line under certain clothing. 

All in all, the Leonisa 3-Pack Cotton Blend Bikini Panties were a comfortable and stylish option that offered just the right amount of coverage. While there were a few minor drawbacks, overall I was pleased with my experience and would recommend them to others looking for a versatile and comfortable pair of underwear. 


### [Leonisa Latex Waist Cincher for Targeted Tummy and Waistline Slimming](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leonisa+Usa?utm\_term=leonisa-latex-waist-cincher-for-targeted-tummy-and-waistline-slimming)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leonisa+Usa?utm_term=leonisa-latex-waist-cincher-for-targeted-tummy-and-waistline-slimming"><img alt="leonisa-womens-instantly-slimmer-latex-waist-cincher-in-black-015791-size-small-herroom-com-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/leonisa-womens-instantly-slimmer-latex-waist-cincher-in-black-015791-size-small-herroom-com-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out this Leonisa Women's Instantly Slimmer Latex Waist Cincher in Black (015791), and I was quite impressed with its performance. The latex material really helped it conform to my body shape, providing a flattering fit without feeling too tight or restrictive. 

One of the best things about this waist trainer is its hook-and-eye closure, which allows for multiple fitting options to ensure a comfortable and secure fit. It's great to have that extra flexibility if you're unsure about your size or want a snugger fit. 

When it comes to performance, I noticed that this waist trainer targets my tummy and waistline area, effectively slimming down my waist and contouring my figure. It's definitely comfortable enough to wear for extended periods, which is essential for anyone looking to use it for a workout or during their daily routine. 

However, one minor inconvenience I encountered was the difficulty in putting it on initially. The latex material is quite stretchy, which means it can be a bit of a challenge to get it on, especially when trying to tighten it to the desired level of compression. But once it's on, it's a cinch (pun intended) to wear! 

Overall, I'm happy to recommend this Leonisa Women's Instantly Slimmer Latex Waist Cincher to anyone looking to minimize their waistline and boost their confidence. It's a high-quality product that definitely delivers on its promises, making it a great choice for anyone who wants a practical and effective shapewear option.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leonisa+Usa?utm_term=leonisa-perfect-fit-classic-panty-comfortable-and-stylish-fit-for-beige-s"><img alt="leonisa-perfect-fit-classic-panty-beige-s-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/leonisa-perfect-fit-classic-panty-beige-s-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Imagine waking up with the feeling of being wrapped in soft, comfortable, and supportive fabric, all while looking and feeling your best. That's the experience I had with Leonisa Perfect Fit Classic Panty in beige size. This panty provides full coverage on my hips, coming up high on the waist to shape and highlight my hips. 

One feature that stood out in my experience was the comfy waistband and leg bands. The soft and stretchy fabric of Leonisa's panty gives me the perfect fit, making it a comfy panty for everyday use. The high waist makes it an excellent choice for concealing panty lines and feeling secure all day. 

While many customers praise its comfort and fit, some do mention that these panties run small in size, so it's essential to pay attention to sizing. Moreover, the 100% cotton gusset underwear makes it a great choice for freshness and comfort. 

Despite being a bit tight in the waist, the Leonisa Perfect Fit Classic Panty in beige size was an excellent choice for me. It provided the support and coverage I was looking for, making it a go-to option for my everyday wardrobe. 


### [Leonisa High-Cut Seamless Shaper Panty](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leonisa+Usa?utm\_term=leonisa-high-cut-seamless-shaper-panty)

As a daily user of Leonisa High-Cut Seamless Shaper Panty, I can personally vouch for its high-waisted design and soft DuraFit compression fabric that makes it feel like a second skin. The double-layered DuraFit fabric on the tummy provides great support, and the seamless leg bands give a comfortable, invisible look under clothes. 

However, a minor downside is that the seam at the back might slide down occasionally, making it less flattering around the butt. Additionally, the fabric content (59.10% Polyamide, 40.90% Elastane) may not appeal to everyone due to its synthetic nature. Overall, this product is a reliable option for those seeking a high-waisted, seamless shaper panty that provides maximum compression and minimal panty lines.

I recently tried out the Leonisa 018524 Plunge Back Classic Sculpting Body Shaper in black for daily wear, and I have to say, it's a game-changer! The double-layered fabric in the tummy and back creates a super strong, yet comfortable compression, allowing me to achieve a sculpted shape without feeling squished. 

The most impressive aspect of this body shaper for me is the plunge back design. It's perfect for those low-cut and backless tops, enhancing my overall look without revealing any underwear lines. Additionally, the invisible leg bands are a fantastic addition, completely hiding beneath my clothes without any pesky visible lines. The overall fit and feel of this shaper is impressive, but I do recommend sizing up to ensure a perfect fit, especially if you're between sizes like some of the reviewers. 

However, there were a couple of minor issues I noticed. The shoulder straps could be a bit uncomfortable for some, which I've heard a few reviewers mention. I would also have appreciated a round back option, as it may make a more comfortable choice for those wearing certain types of clothing. Overall, the Leonisa 018524 Plunge Back Classic Sculpting Body Shaper in black is a remarkable product that has earned a spot in my rotation of go-to, everyday undergarments. 


### [Leonisa Luxe Lace Smoothing Bustier for Uplift & Support](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leonisa+Usa?utm\_term=leonisa-luxe-lace-smoothing-bustier-for-uplift-support)

I recently tried the Leonisa Luxe Lace Underwire Smoothing Bustier and I must say, it left me impressed! The product has a beautiful, elegant look with our signature SmartLace fabric. The fit is spot on, providing a perfect amount of support and coverage. 

I especially love the soft, foam-lined cups with underwire and side boning for a super comfy feel. But don't be fooled by the looks, this bustier truly works wonders in smoothing out the lines under my clothes. 

It's perfect for those special occasions when you want your outfit to look flawless. Overall, I highly recommend this product for its comfort, style, and exceptional fit. 


### [Leonisa Invisible Upper Arm Shaper Vest for Super Comfort](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leonisa+Usa?utm\_term=leonisa-invisible-upper-arm-shaper-vest-for-super-comfort)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leonisa+Usa?utm_term=leonisa-invisible-upper-arm-shaper-vest-for-super-comfort"><img alt="leonisa-invisible-super-comfy-upper-arm-shaper-compression-vest-s-black-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/leonisa-invisible-super-comfy-upper-arm-shaper-compression-vest-s-black-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a women's fashion enthusiast, I recently had the opportunity to try out Leonisa's Invisible Super Comfy Upper Arm Shaper Compression Vest. This vest was designed to provide both comfort and compression for my upper arms and back, and I was intrigued to see how it would work in my daily life. 

The first thing that stood out to me was the vest's SkinFuse fabric. It felt incredibly soft and comfortable against my skin, and the ultrathin material made it virtually unnoticeable underneath my clothing. However, there was one downside - the vest was quite tricky to get on and off due to the tight hook-and-eye closure in the front. 

Another feature of the vest that I appreciated was the criss-cross posture corrector bands in the back. They gently guided my shoulders back and helped me maintain a better posture throughout the day. This was particularly helpful during long work hours when I tended to slouch. 

One aspect of the vest that I found a bit disappointing was the level of compression it provided. While it did help to slim my upper arms, the compression wasn't as strong as I had hoped for. Additionally, the sleeves were quite short and didn't fully cover my elbow, which made it less effective for my specific needs. 

Overall, I would say that the Invisible Super Comfy Upper Arm Shaper Compression Vest is a good option for those looking for a comfortable and discreet shapewear vest. While it may not provide the strongest compression or the longest sleeves, it is definitely a comfortable choice for daily wear. Just remember, it might take a bit of practice to put it on and take it off correctly, and be prepared for a bit of trial and error to find the right size for your body.

I recently tried the Leonisa Undetectable Step-In Mid-Thigh Body Shaper, and I must say, it was a real game-changer! This bodysuit shaper is designed with firm compression that sculpts your whole torso and thighs. What stood out to me most is the double-layered fabric in the torso, which carves out your curves beautifully while the single-layered short bottom shapes lightly without causing any thigh rub. 

One aspect I particularly loved about this shaper is its seamless and wide straps, which made it super comfortable to wear. The open bust design also allowed me to wear my favorite bras, and I appreciated the extra bust support it provided. 

However, there were a couple of downsides for me. Firstly, I found the straps digging into my arms a bit, which was a little uncomfortable. Secondly, the fabric in the thigh area seemed to bunch up slightly, which wasn't the most flattering look for me. 

Overall, the Leonisa Undetectable Step-In Mid-Thigh Body Shaper is an excellent product that provides firm compression, a natural shape, and a smooth look. It's perfect for those who want to add a little extra curves and confidence to their outfit. Just be mindful of the straps and fabric in the thigh area, and you should be good to go! 


### [High-Waisted Firm Compression Leonisa Leggings - Extra Support, Butt-Lift Impact](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leonisa+Usa?utm\_term=high-waisted-firm-compression-leonisa-leggings-extra-support-butt-lift-impact)

I recently started wearing the Leonisa Extra High Waisted Firm Compression Legging in black and have been really happy with my experience. The high waistband provides excellent support and compression for my belly, which is something I was looking for in a legging. I also love that the fabric is moisture-wicking and fast-drying, making it perfect for my active lifestyle. 

One thing that stood out to me was the ruching on the back of the leggings. It gives a nice booty-lift effect, which I find really flattering. However, I also noticed that the leggings are a bit thicker and less breathable than some of the others I've tried. This made them feel a bit warmer than my usual options, but it's a minor inconvenience for the added comfort and support. 

The compression fabric in these leggings is really firm, which I appreciated. It helps me feel more confident in my body and has been great for post-workout recovery. But it can also make them a bit uncomfortable when I'm just lounging around the house. 

Overall, I think this is a great legging for someone looking for firm compression and support in their outfit. The ruching and moisture-wicking fabric are great added features, but the thickness and slightly warmer feeling might not be for everyone. Nevertheless, I'm happy with my choice and have been incorporating these leggings into my daily wardrobe.

Recently, I tried out the Leonisa High-Waisted Striped Classic Panty in White S, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations. The high-waisted design provided excellent coverage in the hips and rear areas, which left me feeling confident all day long. The high-cut legs added a touch of elegance to the overall look, making it perfect for casual or dressy occasions. 

One of the standout features of this panty is its ability to stay in place all day without riding up or slipping down. The fabric content of 80% polyamide and 20% elastane contributed to its comfort and elasticity, ensuring a flawless fit. However, I did notice that the elastic could be slightly thicker to prevent it from rolling down at the top, which was a minor inconvenience. 

Despite some minor adjustments that could be made, I would definitely recommend this panty for anyone looking for a comfortable and well-fitting undergarment. It's versatile, stylish, and provides the perfect balance of coverage and comfort.

The adjustable flat straps were a nice touch, enabling me to wear them both classic and criss-cross, depending on my mood. However, I did notice that the hook and eye closure was a bit tricky to maneuver, taking a little extra effort to fasten. 

This supportive everyday bra was a great choice for me because I could wear it to various occasions without the need for a complete wardrobe change. Its versatility made it perfect for going out, chilling at home, sleeping, or even doing low-impact athletic activities.

### [Stay-in-Place Seamless Slip Short by Leonisa USA](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leonisa+Usa?utm\_term=stay-in-place-seamless-slip-short-by-leonisa-usa)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leonisa+Usa?utm_term=stay-in-place-seamless-slip-short-by-leonisa-usa"><img alt="leonisa-stay-in-place-seamless-slip-short-brown-s-012970-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/leonisa-stay-in-place-seamless-slip-short-brown-s-012970-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer, I recently tried the Leonisa Stay-in-Place Seamless Slip Short in brown, size S. My experience wearing this undergarment was quite positive overall. Firstly, the slimming compression effect was noticeable, especially on my tummy, hips, and thighs. This slip short definitely helped me look flatter, and the high-waist design made me feel confident and comfortable. 

One standout feature was the anti-slip grip technology at the waistband. Compared to other similar products, this short stayed firmly in place without rolling down or flipping, which was a refreshing change. Additionally, the laser-cut leg bands allowed me to wear the short under my clothes without any concerns about show-through. 

However, one downside I encountered was the size. While I usually order size S in most clothing, this slip short seemed to be made with a different sizing chart. The bust/chest, hips, and waist measurements on the product page didn't align with the actual fit for me. As a result, it was a bit challenging to pull the short up and sometimes felt constricting around my chest. 

Despite that issue, I still appreciate the overall design and functionality of the Leonisa Stay-in-Place Seamless Slip Short. It would be a perfect choice for anyone looking for a versatile and comfortable piece to wear at work or special occasions.

The flexible side boning also ensures that the panty stays in place all day, preventing it from rolling down or slipping.
