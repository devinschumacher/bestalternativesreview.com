### [Filaria Montepulciano D'abruzzo - Delicious Wine Bottle](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Montepulciano+Wine?utm\_term=filaria-montepulciano-dabruzzo-delicious-wine-bottle)

I recently gave the Filari Montepulciano D'abruzzo a try, and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. This 750 ml bottle is perfect for a cozy night in, with its fruity nose of plums, blueberries, and cherries that instantly grabbed my attention. The addition of dried flowers and some orange zest only added to its delightfulness. 

As I took my first sip, I immediately noticed its medium to full body, which beautifully contrasted with its chewy tannins. The ripe fruitiness was a delight on my palate, balancing out the full-bodied feel. However, there was a slight downside to the experience- the wine wasn't quite what I was expecting from a Montepulciano variety. It didn't have that distinct earthy, spicy character that is often associated with this grape. Nonetheless, the Filari Montepulciano D'abruzzo proved to be a refreshing and flavorful choice for a casual wine lover like me.

Recently I gave Zaccagnini Montelpuciano a try, a Montepulciano wine from Abruzzo with varying vintages. The bottle was a 375ml, the perfect size for a casual night in. The wine had a distinct aroma of cherries and plums that filled the glass. As I took my first sip, the taste was full-bodied and rich, with notes of licorice and oak adding depth to the flavor. 

One of the things I appreciated about the wine was the emphasis on the grape's origin.

The wine was fermented with skin temperature control and aged in oak barrels for 6 months, then 3 more months in the bottle. This intricate and careful winemaking process showed through every sip, making the wine a delightful drinking experience. 

However, there was a minor downside to the wine. Some of the more discerning wine enthusiasts found the wine to be slightly rough or overly heavy, detracting slightly from the overall enjoyment. Despite this, the wine was overall well-received, with many buyers praising it as a great value for the price. 

All in all, my experience with Zaccagnini Montelpuciano was a positive one. The wine's rich flavor, emphasis on authenticity, and reasonable price point made it a winner in my book.
