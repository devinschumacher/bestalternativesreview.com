### How do I connect the Logitech M310 to my computer?

The Logitech M310 connects to your computer using a USB dongle that plugs into your computer's USB port. Before you can use the mouse, you will need to install the relevant drivers on your computer. You can download these drivers from the Logitech website or through the SetPoint software that comes pre-installed on the M310. 

Once the drivers are installed, you can connect the dongle to the computer and switch on the M310. The mouse will automatically start working once it's turned on and connected to the dongle. The USB dongle ensures a stable and secure connection, even when using the mouse in challenging environments such as crowded offices or with multiple users. 


### How do I know when the batteries in my Logitech M310 need replacing?

The Logitech M310 features a low battery indicator that will alert you when the batteries need replacing. This indicator is located on the bottom of the mouse, just below the tracking sensor. When the batteries are running low, the indicator will blink continuously, reminding you to replace them soon. 

It is essential to replace the batteries before they run out entirely, as the mouse may not function correctly or may shut down unexpectedly. To replace the batteries, you will need to open the battery compartment by pressing the small button on the bottom of the mouse. Once the compartment is open, you can replace the batteries with new, alkaline, or rechargeable AA batteries.

### Can the Logitech M310 be used as a right-handed mouse?

Yes, the Logitech M310 can be used as a right-handed mouse. Although the M310 is designed as an ambidextrous mouse with buttons on both sides, it can be customized to suit right-handed users. By using the SetPoint software that comes pre-installed on the M310, you can remap the buttons to suit your preferences and ensure comfortable use with your right hand. 

If you prefer a mouse with a more ergonomic design suited for right-handed users, you may want to consider other Logitech products specifically designed for right-handed users, such as the Logitech M570 Trackball or the Logitech M585 Wireless Trackball. However, with the M310's customizable buttons and ambidextrous design, it can still be an excellent choice for right-handed users with some customization.

The M310's size also allows for comfortable use, even for users with smaller hands. Its lightweight design further adds to its portability and ease of use. 

Additionally, the M310's slim profile and low-profile buttons ensure that it glides smoothly across most surfaces, providing a smooth and accurate tracking experience.
