I recently tried out the FootJoy DryJoys Select LS Rain Jacket, and I must say, it did not disappoint. This jacket offers a great combination of comfort, style, and protection against the rain. The DWR finish is quite effective in preventing water from seeping into the jacket, keeping me dry even during heavy downpours.

Step into the world of golfing rain gear, and you'll find FootJoy's Dryjoys Tour LTS Rain Jacket. This jacket comes with plenty of features that are designed to keep you warm, comfortable, and dry on the golf course.

Upon trying it out for the first time during a drizzly round, I was blown away by its lightweight feel.

Unfortunately, the adjustable waterproof cuffs turned out to be a bit of a disappointment.

Overall, the FootJoy Dryjoys Select Rain Jacket was lightweight and offered impressive protection from rain. However, the cuffs needed improvement to truly guarantee a waterproof experience. Considering its high price, it's worth a try, but golfers may want to give it a test run before fully committing.

## FAQ


### What is Footjoy Rain Gear?

Footjoy Rain Gear is a line of waterproof and breathable footwear designed to keep golfers' feet dry and comfortable during wet weather conditions. The products feature Footjoy's patented Hydroshell technology, which repels water while allowing moisture to escape, ensuring that feet stay dry and comfortable. 

The Footjoy Rain Gear line offers various models, including shoes and boots, catering to different preferences and playing styles. These products are suitable for golfers who want to stay active on the course, regardless of rain, sleet, or snow, and need footwear that can protect against wet conditions. 


### What is the Hydroshell technology?

Hydroshell technology is a proprietary membrane developed by Footjoy specifically for their waterproof and breathable golf shoes. The membrane consists of millions of microscopic pores that allow moisture vapor to escape while preventing water from entering the shoe. This ensures that the foot remains dry and comfortable, even in wet weather conditions. 

Hydroshell technology provides excellent breathability, meaning that the shoes can effectively dissipate the heat and moisture trapped inside the footwear. This helps to prevent blisters and discomfort, allowing golfers to play comfortably in wet conditions. Additionally, the technology ensures that the shoes remain lightweight, as excess moisture is not absorbed into the footwear material. 


### Are Footjoy Rain Gear shoes comfortable?

Yes, Footjoy Rain Gear shoes are comfortable. Footjoy prioritizes the comfort of their customers, and their Rain Gear line is no exception. The products are designed to be worn for long periods, and they include various features to ensure optimal comfort. These features include a cushioned midsole, which provides shock absorption, and a flexible sole, which allows for natural foot movement. 

Moreover, the shoes are lined with a soft and breathable fabric that helps to reduce friction and prevent blisters. Additionally, the Hydroshell technology mentioned earlier ensures that feet stay dry and comfortable, even in wet conditions. Overall, Footjoy Rain Gear shoes are designed to provide a snug and comfortable fit, allowing golfers to focus on their game rather than experiencing foot discomfort. 


### What is the Footjoy Rain Gear warranty?

The warranty for Footjoy Rain Gear shoes generally covers defects in materials and workmanship for a specific period, usually ranging from 1 year to 3 years depending on the specific product model and other factors. It is essential to check the warranty details for the specific Footjoy Rain Gear product you are interested in to determine the coverage period. 

If you experience any issues with your Footjoy Rain Gear footwear, you should contact the retailer or the manufacturer where you purchased the product. They can provide guidance on the warranty process and help you resolve any problems with the product. Be prepared to provide proof of purchase, such as a receipt or a sales receipt, when contacting the retailer or the manufacturer. 


### How should I care for my Footjoy Rain Gear shoes?

To maintain the performance and longevity of your Footjoy Rain Gear shoes, it is essential to follow proper care instructions. First, clean your shoes regularly using a soft brush or cloth to avoid damaging the Hydroshell membrane. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials, as these can harm the shoes' waterproof coating and affect the materials' integrity. 

It is also essential to allow your shoes to air dry after using them, rather than placing them in a dryer or exposing them to direct heat. This helps to prevent damage to the Hydroshell technology and ensures that the shoes maintain their waterproof properties. If necessary, you can use a shoe tree to help shape the shoes and absorb moisture. Additionally, store your shoes away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures, as these can also damage the materials and affect the shoes' performance over time. 


### What are some different models of Footjoy Rain Gear shoes?

Some of the different models of Footjoy Rain Gear shoes include the Dryjoys Pure Waterproof Spikeless Golf Shoes, the All-Weather Golf Shoe, the Dryjoys S-Series Golf Shoes, and the Dryjoys XP Spikeless Golf Shoes. Each model offers unique features and design elements tailored to meet the needs of different golfers. For example, the Dryjoys Pure Waterproof Spikeless Golf Shoes are designed for players who prefer a spikeless shoe with a minimalist design, while the Dryjoys XP Spikeless Golf Shoes provide more durable, long-lasting performance for those who enjoy spending time on the course. 

It is crucial to choose the right Footjoy Rain Gear shoe model based on your personal preferences, playing style, and needs. Read reviews, check product specifications, and try on the shoes in-store or online to ensure the best fit and performance for your specific situation. Remember to consider factors like waterproofing, breathability, comfort, and durability when selecting your perfect Footjoy Rain Gear shoe.
