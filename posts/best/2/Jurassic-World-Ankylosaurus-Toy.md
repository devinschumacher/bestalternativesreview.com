Last week, my kids and I were at a toy store, and I stumbled upon this adorable plush toy - the Jurassic World Baby Ankylosaurus Bumpy. As a Jurassic Park fan, I just couldn't resist. The 38-cm long plush was soft, perfect for cuddling, and featured those iconic bumps on its back, just like in the movies. 

One of the most exciting features that stood out was the ROAR sound and floppy legs. My kids couldn't stop playing with it and making the dinosaur 'roar'. It's definitely a unique addition to their toy collection, and they often take it to bed for naptime or cuddles before sleep. 

However, something that could have been a bit better was the battery life. It did run out relatively quickly, which can be frustrating for kids. The battery pack doesn't seem to be removable without damaging the toy, which I thought was a missed opportunity. 

Overall, it's a fantastic dinosaur toy for kids and a perfect gift for any Jurassic World fan. It's just a touch disappointing that the battery life isn't longer, but the pros definitely outweigh the cons. It's so soft and cuddly, and the kids absolutely love it.
