### [Premium Macallan Highland Scotch Whisky - 750 ml](https://serp.ly/amazon/Macallan+21?utm\_term=premium-macallan-highland-scotch-whisky-750-ml)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Macallan+21?utm_term=premium-macallan-highland-scotch-whisky-750-ml"><img alt="the-macallan-highland-scotch-whisky-single-malt-750-ml-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/the-macallan-highland-scotch-whisky-single-malt-750-ml-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Lately, I've become a fan of The Macallan's single malt whisky series, and the 12-year-old version in particular. The Sherry Oak range stands out for me because of its unique aging process. It's matured in Spanish and American oak casks, giving it a distinct flavor profile. Just like the gift giver who found that The Macallan Whisky was the perfect choice for their dad, I too have found myself coming back to this whisky time and time again. What I love most about it is its smooth taste with just the right blend of dried fruits, sherry sweetness, and hints of wood smoke. 

However, there's one aspect that I feel could be improved. I've noticed that the price has increased over the years. Now, it's more expensive than it was before, but the quality hasn't changed. Despite this, I still think it's an excellent choice for whisky lovers, especially for those who appreciate a balanced taste. There's a reason why it's one of the world's leading single malt whiskies, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a luxurious sip.

### What is Macallan 21?

Macallan 21 is a single malt Scotch whisky. It is aged for a minimum of 21 years in American oak casks, which contribute to its rich, honeyed flavors and deep amber color. Macallan 21 is part of the Macallan Fine Oak Collection, a series of whiskies aged in different cask types, with this variation being aged in American oak. 

The Macallan distillery is located in Speyside, Scotland, and has been producing fine whiskies since 1824. Macallan 21 is highly regarded for its smooth taste, complexity, and long finish, making it a popular choice among whisky connoisseurs and enthusiasts alike. It is ideal for sipping neat or as the base of classic cocktails. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Macallan+21"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Macallan-21-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Macallan-21-5" height="540"></a></div>


### How should I store Macallan 21?

Macallan 21, like other whiskies, should be stored in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight, heat, and humidity. Ideally, it should be kept in a temperature range of 12-18°C (54-64°F) and with a humidity level between 50-75%. The goal is to maintain the whisky at its optimum maturation level to preserve its flavors and aromas. 

Avoid storing the whisky in brightly lit areas, as direct sunlight can harm the color of the whisky and its taste. Additionally, it should not be stored in a freezer, as extreme cold can also affect the taste and presentation of the whisky. Keep the bottle upright and tightly sealed to protect it from any external contaminants that may enter the whisky. 


### Can I cellar Macallan 21?

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Macallan+21"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Macallan-21-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Macallan-21-6" height="540"></a></div>

Yes, Macallan 21 can be cellared if you wish to age it further. However, you should ensure that the bottle remains in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures. The ideal storage conditions are those mentioned above in the previous answer. If stored properly, the whisky can continue to mature in the bottle, developing more complex flavors and aromas over time. 

It is essential to store the whisky upright and maintain a consistent temperature and humidity level for optimal aging. When ready to drink, gently twist off the cap or use a waiter's friend opener to keep the cork intact. Serve the whisky at room temperature to enjoy its full flavors and aromas. Be aware that as the whisky ages, it may undergo changes in color, flavor intensity, and aroma. 


### What type of glassware is suitable for enjoying Macallan 21?

The whisky tumbler or Glencairn glass is the traditional choice for drinking Macallan 21 or any other whisky. These glasses are designed to concentrate the aromas of the whisky and allow you to experience its full flavors. A whisky tumbler typically has a wide, squared bottom and a slightly tapered lip, while a Glencairn glass features a narrower, curved shape with a small lip. Both choices are excellent for enjoying the whiskey neat or with the addition of a few drops of water, which can help open up the aromas and flavors. 

When using a whisky tumbler, hold the glass by the base with a firm grip, swirl the whisky gently to release the aromas, and take a small sip. Allow the whisky's flavors to evolve in your mouth before swallowing, and don't forget to appreciate the whisky's texture. For those who prefer a more structured experience, the Glencairn glass can provide a more focused and enjoyable tasting. 


### Is Macallan 21 suitable for mixing in cocktails?

While Macallan 21 is an exceptional sipping whisky, it can also be used in cocktails, where its rich, honeyed flavors can truly shine. The whisky's versatility makes it a suitable choice for a variety of classic cocktails, such as the Old Fashioned, Manhattan, and Whisky Sour. It can also be used in newer, more creative cocktails that showcase its unique character. 

When using Macallan 21 in cocktails, be mindful of the other ingredients and the balance they contribute. Since the whisky is already well-aged, it may not require additional aging or modification via the use of bitters, syrups, or other modifiers. A good cocktail recipe will highlight the whisky's natural flavors and create a harmonious balance of flavors. As always, ensure that you use high-quality ingredients and proper mixing techniques to enjoy the best possible results. 


### What's the best way to savor the Macallan 21 experience?

To fully appreciate the rich, honeyed flavors and luxurious texture of Macallan 21, it is recommended to savor it neat or with a few drops of water. When served at room temperature, the whisky will release its aromas, allowing you to fully enjoy its complex flavors and aromas. Take your time with each sip, allowing the whisky to linger on your palate and appreciate the flavors as they evolve. 

You can also use a Glencairn glass, which is specifically designed to concentrate aromas and reveal the whisky's depth and complexity. Hold the glass by the base with a firm grip, gently swirl the whisky, and take a small sip. Allow the whisky's flavors to evolve in your mouth before swallowing, and don't forget to appreciate the whisky's texture. If you enjoy a longer sip, the Glencairn glass can provide a more structured and enjoyable tasting experience.
