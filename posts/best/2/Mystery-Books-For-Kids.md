### [August Acrobat: A Calendar Mysteries Adventure for Kids](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Mystery+Books+For+Kids?utm\_term=august-acrobat-a-calendar-mysteries-adventure-for-kids)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Mystery+Books+For+Kids?utm_term=august-acrobat-a-calendar-mysteries-adventure-for-kids"><img alt="calendar-mysteries-8-august-acrobat-book-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/calendar-mysteries-8-august-acrobat-book-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

A recent addition to my bookshelf, the Calendar Mysteries #8: August Acrobat has quickly become my go-to read during my evening downtime. The story follows the children of Ron Roy's A to Z Mysteries, who stumble upon a traveling circus needing help with their acrobatics. The kids eagerly step in to assist, transforming the show into a success. 

One of the most appealing aspects of this book is its engaging and relatable narrative. The main characters are likable, their interactions endearing, and the storyline is filled with suspense and mystery that keeps you engrossed. Furthermore, the book's unique take on the circus setting adds a fresh twist to the typical storyline. 

On the other hand, some of the plot twists seemed somewhat far-fetched, making it hard for me to fully immerse myself in the story. Additionally, the pacing of the book felt a tad off at times, causing a slight disruption in the flow of the story. Despite these minor drawbacks, I appreciated the book enough to look forward to the next issue in the series. 

All in all, if you're a fan of mystery, are looking for a fresh addition to your children's library or a light-hearted read for yourself, the Calendar Mysteries #8: August Acrobat fits the bill.
