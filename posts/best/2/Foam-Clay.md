## Buyer's Guide

Welcome to the Foam Clay Buyer's Guide - your go-to resource for understanding the key aspects of foam clay before making your purchase. Foam clay is a versatile and creative sculpting material that can be used for a variety of art projects, hobbies, and educational activities. In this guide, we will explore the essential features, considerations, and advice regarding foam clay to help you make an informed decision. 


### Type of Foam Clay

There are several types of foam clay available in the market, each with its unique characteristics. The two primary types are air-dry and oven-dry foam clay. Air-dry clays are ideal for projects requiring more flexibility, like sculptural work or mold making.

### Durability and Longevity

When selecting foam clay, consider its durability and how long it will last. Some foam clays are more brittle and may break easily, while others are more resilient and can withstand rough handling. Check customer reviews and product description to ensure the foam clay you choose can withstand general wear and tear. Additionally, consider if the clay is safe for the intended use and storage conditions. 


### Safety and Health Concerns

While foam clay is generally considered safe for most users, certain individuals may have specific health concerns. Some foam clay can produce dust that may cause irritation or allergies for sensitive individuals.

The storage container should be airtight, to prevent the clay from drying out and becoming brittle. An airtight container with a sealable lid works best for this purpose, as it helps to maintain the moisture content of the clay. It is also important to keep the container at room temperature, as extreme heat or cold can affect the clay's consistency. 

If the foam clay container has become compromised, it is best to transfer the clay to a new airtight container, ensuring that the existing clay is not exposed to air and that any leftover pieces are kept dry and separate from the fresh clay. Storing foam clay properly will help to maintain its integrity and ease of use, ensuring that it remains a valuable art supply for creativity and self-expression.

### Can foam clay be mixed with other materials to create custom colors?

Yes, foam clay can be mixed with other materials to create custom colors, which can help to achieve a desired effect or match a specific palette. The clay can be diluted with water or mixed with different types of pigments or colorants to produce a wide range of shades. Some artists even prefer to use pre-mix colorants and color shapers to achieve a specific hue. 

To achieve the best results when mixing foam clay with other materials, it is essential to maintain the clay's original consistency and avoid adding too much water or pigment to the mix. Excess moisture can make the foam clay unstable and difficult to work with, while too much pigment may affect the clay's texture and usability. Experimentation and practice with mixing may be required, but the end result can be a unique and customized color that best suits a particular project or application. 


### Is foam clay suitable for outdoor use?

While foam clay is an excellent option for indoor use, its suitability for outdoor applications can vary depending on the specific product and weather conditions. Some foam clay products are designed for outdoor use and can withstand exposure to the elements, such as rain, humidity, and temperature changes. However, these products may require sealing or other protective measures to ensure their longevity. 

For artists looking to create outdoor sculptures or installations, it is essential to choose a foam clay product specifically designed for outdoor use. Additionally, it is recommended to consult the manufacturer's guidelines and recommendations for proper storage and handling of the clay when exposed to the elements. Proper preparation and protection measures can help ensure that foam clay artwork remains intact and vibrant, even in challenging outdoor conditions.
