I recently brought home a Ficus Elastica 'Burgundy' home and it instantly became my favorite indoor buddy. The thick, glossy, dark-green leaves add a natural charm that's hard to resist, while the pink to purplish-looking stipules add a lovely pop of color. 

In the beginning, I thought it would be a high-maintenance plant but, to my surprise, it turned out to be quite low-key and simple to care for. It's amazing to see it grow healthy and tall in low light conditions, which makes it an ideal indoor addition. However, I did learn a lesson the hard way when my curious kitten tried to take a bite of the leaves, and I realized the sap from these plants can be toxic - a lesson I never want to learn again!

### [Costa Farms 42in. Tall Green Money Tree for Low Light Indoor Spaces](https://serp.ly/amazon/Indoor+Trees+Low+Light?utm\_term=costa-farms-42in-tall-green-money-tree-for-low-light-indoor-spaces)

I recently brought home this Costa Farms Live Indoor 42in. Tall Green Money Tree and let me tell you, it's been quite the journey. At first, I was in awe of its lush green foliage and how it perfectly fit in the large, mid-century modern planter I had. The container itself was a stylish addition to my space, but I didn't realize it didn't have any holes for excess water to drain. As a result, I learned to be extra cautious when watering, making sure to avoid spillage. 

This Money Tree has been quite a moderate grower, adapting well to my environment with its indirect light. However, I did notice that it required more attention in the spring and summer months, as it responded well to fertilizers labeled for potted plants. I also learned the hard way that this plant should never be repotted without an inch or two wider container, otherwise it may outgrow its current one and become too stressed. 

Overall, my experience with this Money Tree has been a bit of a roller coaster. While it's been a beautiful addition to my indoor space, the broken branches I received with the plant were a bit frustrating. Nevertheless, I've enjoyed the challenge of nurturing such a unique and striking plant. And who knows, maybe one day I'll have a full-grown Money Tree, just waiting to bring me good fortune!

### What are the benefits of low light indoor trees?

Low light indoor trees offer a multitude of benefits, including cleaning the air, purifying it by removing pollutants such as Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and toxins present in cleaning products. Indoor plants act as natural humidifiers, helping to keep your home from becoming too dry by releasing moisture into the air. Moreover, they possess unique natural scents that contribute to a more pleasant and refreshing indoor environment. 

In addition to these benefits, indoor low light trees also help reduce stress levels, making them perfect for work settings or relaxation areas. They can improve sleep quality, increase energy levels, decrease headaches, and promote a sense of calmness. They are a non-toxic and eco-friendly way to improve indoor air quality while adding natural beauty to any interior space.

When selecting an indoor low light tree, it's essential to consider the plant's hardiness level, size, and care requirements. For example, some species may require more frequent watering or have specific lighting needs. It's also essential to choose a tree that matches the available light in your space, whether it's an office with low indirect light or a dark corner at home. Consider the size of the plant when determining its suitability for your space. 

Artificial indoor low light trees are a low-maintenance option for those who prefer fuss-free plants. These trees are designed to mimic real plants but require less care, such as watering or pruning. Artificial indoor low-light trees come in a wide range of styles and materials, making it easy to find the perfect one for your space. 


### Do artificial indoor low-light trees require maintenance?

No, artificial indoor low-light trees do not require maintenance. They are designed to look and feel like real trees, yet they do not need watering, sunlight, or pruning. This makes them an excellent alternative for those who do not have time or expertise to care for real plants. Artificial indoor low-light trees are also made to last, ensuring that your space will look beautiful for a long time. 

Artificial indoor low-light trees are an environmentally friendly option, as they do not need the water, fertilizers, or pest control measures that real plants need. This means that they can be a more sustainable choice for people who want to decorate their homes or offices without impacting the environment. You don't have to worry about the additional workload that comes with maintaining real indoor plants with artificial indoor low-light trees. 


### Can indoor low light trees be used in workspaces?

Absolutely! Indoor low light trees can be an excellent choice for workspaces as they provide a natural aesthetic while adding many benefits. They are low maintenance, making them ideal for busy offices where employees may not have time to care for their well-being. In fact, indoor plants can positively affect productivity, mood, and creativity in any work environment. 

Indoor low light trees also function as natural humidifiers, which can be essential in air conditioned spaces. Overly dry air can cause skin irritation, respiratory problems, and other health issues, so having indoor plants in the office is a great help in maintaining a comfortable environment. These trees can also help filter out toxins and pollutants, making the air cleaner and more pleasant to breathe. 


### Will all indoor low light trees thrive in low light conditions?

Not all indoor low light trees will thrive in low light conditions, but most of them are specifically designed to do so. Some plants require direct or indirect sunlight for optimal growth and can get by with low light conditions or even no sunlight. These indoor trees are ideal for offices or apartments with little or no natural light. 

However, it's always best to research the care requirements for your chosen indoor low light tree before purchasing. Make sure the tree you choose not only tolerates low light but also matches the light levels in your home or office. This will help ensure the tree stays healthy and happy, providing the benefits you're looking for. If a tree doesn't get enough light, it may appear less healthy, affecting its growth, leaf size, and overall appearance.
