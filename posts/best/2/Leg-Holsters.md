As a seasoned firearms enthusiast, I recently had the chance to try out the Glock 17, 22, 44, 45 Level 2 Duty Drop Leg Holster from BSOG. This holster stood out among others I've used due to its quick-release feature, allowing me to draw my firearm safely and smoothly. The level 2 strap required a simple push of a button, making it a breeze to get my firearm out of the holster for use. 

One of the most impressive features of this holster was its compatibility with various red dot sights. I appreciated the tapered design on the muzzle end, accommodating for threaded barrels. The holster was robust yet easy to wear, making it an excellent choice for duty situations. 

That being said, I noticed that the Quick Release Duty Drop Leg Holster was not as adjustable as I would've preferred. It would be nice to have more options for fine-tuning the fit and positioning of the holster. However, overall, this Glock holster provided a reliable and efficient way of carrying my firearms during my daily routine.
