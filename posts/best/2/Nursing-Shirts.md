### [Everywhere Nursing V-Neck Tee - Discreet & Stylish](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Nursing+Shirts?utm\_term=everywhere-nursing-v-neck-tee-discreet-stylish)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Nursing+Shirts?utm_term=everywhere-nursing-v-neck-tee-discreet-stylish"><img alt="everywhere-nursing-v-neck-tee-black-m-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/everywhere-nursing-v-neck-tee-black-m-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Everywhere Nursing V-Neck Tee in Black/M has been a staple in my wardrobe for quite some time now. It offers a stylish yet functional design that makes nursing and pumping quick and discreet. The overlapping single side slit acts as a built-in nursing cover, which comes in handy when nursing in public. 

One of the features I appreciate the most is the versatility of this tee. You can wear it side-tied for a cropped-over-bump look while expecting, tucked in, or even reverse to wear the v-neck in the back. This makes it perfect for both pregnancy, postpartum, and beyond. 

While the flattering neckline and soft cotton fabric are certainly positive points, there are a couple of minor concerns. The tee may feel a bit boxy, and if you're not expecting, you might want to size up. However, overall, the pros outweigh the cons, and I'd say this is a top-notch nursing top that's stylish, comfortable, and practical for any mom.
