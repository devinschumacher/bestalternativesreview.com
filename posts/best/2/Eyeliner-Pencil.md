### [Kylie Cosmetics Gel Eyeliner Pencil for Perfect One-Stroke Application and Long-Lasting Wear](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Eyeliner+Pencil?utm\_term=kylie-cosmetics-gel-eyeliner-pencil-for-perfect-one-stroke-application-and-long-lasting-wear)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Eyeliner+Pencil?utm_term=kylie-cosmetics-gel-eyeliner-pencil-for-perfect-one-stroke-application-and-long-lasting-wear"><img alt="kylie-cosmetics-gel-eyeliner-pencil-shimmery-black-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/kylie-cosmetics-gel-eyeliner-pencil-shimmery-black-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who loves experimenting with different makeup looks, I was excited to try the Kylie Cosmetics Gel Eyeliner Pencil. I selected the shimmery black shade to give my everyday look a glamorous edge. 

Upon opening the pencil, I was immediately impressed by the creamy texture and the ease at which it glided on my skin. The color intensity was fantastic, leaving my eyeliner looking well-defined and smooth. What I also appreciated was the long-lasting wear, which made my makeup stay put all day. 

However, there were a couple of issues that I encountered. Firstly, I found that the eyeliner pencil was quite challenging to sharpen. Despite trying various sharpeners, I couldn't seem to get a sharp tip that would give me the crisp lines I was after. Secondly, I noticed that the shimmery aspect of the pencil didn't last as long as the matte versions, with the luster fading after a few hours. 

In conclusion, the Kylie Cosmetics Gel Eyeliner Pencil in shimmery black offers a smooth, long-lasting, and intense eyeliner look. However, it could be improved with a more practical sharpening mechanism and a longer-lasting shimmer. 


### [Waterproof Creamy Eyeliner Pencil for Smudge-Proof Application](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Eyeliner+Pencil?utm\_term=waterproof-creamy-eyeliner-pencil-for-smudge-proof-application)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Eyeliner+Pencil?utm_term=waterproof-creamy-eyeliner-pencil-for-smudge-proof-application"><img alt="jordana-eyeliner-for-eyes-draw-the-line-eyeliner-pencil-smokey-0-012-oz-gray-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/jordana-eyeliner-for-eyes-draw-the-line-eyeliner-pencil-smokey-0-012-oz-gray-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Jordana Eyeliner for Eyes - Draw The Line Eyeliner Pencil in Smokey for quite some time now, and I must say, it's a game-changer! The eyeliner is incredibly smudge-proof and transfer-proof, which means it lasts for an impressive 10 hours. The creamy texture glides on like a dream, making application a breeze. 

One of the best things about this eyeliner is its built-in sharpener, which makes sharpening a hassle-free experience. It's also cruelty-free, and the company takes extra measures to ensure their products are preservative and BHT-free. 

While there are a variety of colors to choose from, I've personally been enjoying the Smokey shade. The eyeliner works great on both the upper and lower lashline, and it's even safe for waterline use. The company has unfortunately discontinued some of their other colors, but they are still making this one available. 

Overall, I'm thrilled with the performance of the Jordana Eyeliner for Eyes - Draw The Line Eyeliner Pencil in Smokey, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a long-lasting, waterproof eyeliner.

I loved the retractable design - it was so convenient and eliminated the hassle of sharpening the pencil. The 12 pure color options allowed me to switch up my look, with hues like black and purple being my go-to day looks, and bolder shades like pink and rose for a night out. I appreciated that it was easy to apply and the tip was perfect for creating a subtle, smoked out effect. 

One downside I encountered was that while the Eyeliner Pencil was marketed as waterproof, it didn't perform as well as I hoped in humid weather. Despite this, the formula had great coverage and was long-lasting. I also appreciated that the pencil was hypoallergenic, dermatologist-tested, and vegan - features that are important to me as a makeup enthusiast. Overall, it was a fantastic product and I would definitely recommend it to others.

### [Maybelline New York Long-Lasting Drama Matte Eyeliner Jet Black Pencil](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Eyeliner+Pencil?utm\_term=maybelline-new-york-long-lasting-drama-matte-eyeliner-jet-black-pencil)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Eyeliner+Pencil?utm_term=maybelline-new-york-long-lasting-drama-matte-eyeliner-jet-black-pencil"><img alt="maybelline-new-york-lasting-drama-matte-eyeliner-makeup-jet-black-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/maybelline-new-york-lasting-drama-matte-eyeliner-makeup-jet-black-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

This matte eyeliner pencil, from Maybelline, has a long-lasting and waterproof formula. The blendable color pigments create a creamy finish that lasts up to 24 hours, without smudging or flaking. It's a real lifesaver for people who often end up with smudged eyeliner throughout the day. 

The product comes with an applicator that is perfect for those who tend to avoid eyeliner due to the fuss it can cause. You don't need to worry about precision here. Just one quick swipe, and you're good to go! 

The eyeliner is waterproof, which means you can go swimming without having to redo it. However, this also means it's quite hard to remove at the end of the day. You'll need a strong makeup remover to get it off, which might be a bit harsh on the skin around your eyes. 

Despite some flaws, the overall product is well-suited for sensitive eyes and contact lens wearers. It's great if you're always on the go but still want to wear eyeliner. 

However, one significant drawback is that once the tip starts wearing down, there's no way to sharpen it. It becomes a one-time-use product then, which can be a bit of a disappointment given the price. 

In conclusion, while it's not perfect and has a few drawbacks, the Maybelline Lasting Drama Matte Eyeliner is a good addition to your makeup bag, especially if you're out and about quite often and need a long-lasting, smudge-proof eyeliner.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Eyeliner+Pencil?utm_term=shany-vicious-slim-liner-eye-pencil"><img alt="shany-slim-liner-eye-pencil-vicious-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/shany-slim-liner-eye-pencil-vicious-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [R.E.M. Beauty Teddy Bear Kohl Eyeliner Pencil](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Eyeliner+Pencil?utm\_term=r-e-m-beauty-teddy-bear-kohl-eyeliner-pencil)

Recently, I had the chance to try out the R. E. M. Beauty At The Borderline Kohl Eyeliner Pencil in the Teddy Bear shade, inspired by Ari's signature bold eye looks. The product promised to glide on easily, apply smoothly, and feel lightweight and ultra-creamy. In an independent study, it was found that 100% of participants agreed that the eyeliner pencil glides on easily and has opaque, one-stroke, highly-pigmented color. However, in my own experience, I found that the eyeliner was quite hard to apply, especially compared to other eyeliner pencils I've used. 

One thing I did appreciate about this product was its smudge-proof and transfer-proof formula. I didn't notice any smudging or transferring onto my skin throughout the day. But it didn't feel quite as lightweight and creamy as I had hoped. I found that I had to press a bit harder to get the eyeliner to show up on my eyelids, which wasn't the most comfortable experience.

### [Higher Self Long-Wear Blue Eyeliner Pencil for Vibrant Color](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Eyeliner+Pencil?utm\_term=higher-self-long-wear-blue-eyeliner-pencil-for-vibrant-color)

The Higher Self shade in particular stood out to me - it offered a bright, almost nude shade that was perfect for defining my waterline. The Law of Attraction shade, a soft cream hue, was perfect for creating a subtle and natural smoky eye look. 

However, I did face some challenges with sharpening the pencils. I found the pencil itself sticky and had a hard time getting a clean, usable point. This issue became even more frustrating when I tried Eyeko's own sharpener, which didn't help much. 

Overall, the Eyeko Limitless Long-Wear Pencil Eyeliner is a great product for those seeking a long-wearing, colorful eyeliner that stays put. Just be aware of the sharpening issues and be prepared to invest some extra patience and effort into maintaining a clean, usable pencil.

### [Fenty Beauty by Rihanna Flypencil Longwear Pencil Eyeliner - Versatile, Smudge-Resistant, and Cruelty-Free](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Eyeliner+Pencil?utm\_term=fenty-beauty-by-rihanna-flypencil-longwear-pencil-eyeliner-versatile-smudge-resistant-and-cruelty-free)

Fenty Beauty by Rihanna's Flypencil Longwear Pencil Eyeliner is a versatile and long-lasting eyeliner that I've been using for the past few weeks. I love the wide variety of finishes it offers - matte, shimmer, metallic, and glitter. The creamy texture glides on effortlessly, even on my sensitive eyelids. However, it is surprisingly difficult to apply a thin line due to the thick pencil tip. 

One of the most frustrating aspects of this eyeliner was the smudge-resistant formula that did not work as advertised. I ended up with smudged eyeliners every time I tried to create a more dramatic look. The product dries out quickly, causing it to break easily when trying to apply it to my eyelids. 

I had to apply significant pressure with the pencil on my eyelids to achieve any sort of color payoff, which makes me worry about its impact on my delicate eyelids. I can't imagine using a thicker, softer pencil tip to draw a thin, classy line on my eyelids, as the texture is too thick for that. 

The water-resistant formula has mixed results for me. While it doesn't fade or transfer, the liner tends to flake off my eyelids and ends up on my face throughout the day, ruining the look I've worked to create. This became more noticeable as the pencil's tip started to dry out. 

Overall, I appreciate the range of shades available and the cruelty-free aspect of the product. However, the thick pencil tip, fragile formula, and tendency to flake are significant drawbacks that may frustrate other users.

Overall, the Lakme Eyeconic Kajal has definitely become a staple in my makeup collection. Its blend of great color, durability, and easy-to-use design make it a standout product. If you're in the market for an affordable, high-quality eyeliner pencil, this one is certainly worth a try.

### What are the benefits of using an eyeliner pencil?

Eyeliner pencils are versatile and easy to use, offering a wide range of options. They can be smudged for a smokey eye look, drawn on for a sharp wing, or used for filling in sparse eyelashes.

### How do I apply eyeliner pencil correctly?

Start by choosing the right eyeliner pencil for your skin type and eye shape. Wet the tip of the pencil with water or eyeliner pencil sharpening spray to make it glide more smoothly on your eyelid. Alternatively, you can use a pencil sharpener to create a sharp point. Hold the pencil at a 45-degree angle, and gently line the outer corner of your eyelid, following the natural curve of your eyelashes. Apply thin lines first, and then gradually build up the intensity until you achieve your desired look. 

For a sharp winged look, draw a line along the upper lashline, extending it slightly past the outer corner. You can use the angled tip of the pencil to create the wing, or use a flat brush or sponge to blend the line for a softer finish. Always remember to clean your eyeliner pencil between uses to ensure the best quality and to avoid any infections or irritations.

There are also eyeliner pencils with retractable tips, making them easy to use and avoiding the need for sharpening. Some eyeliner pencils also come with a sharpener, ensuring a precise tip every time. 


### How do I remove eyeliner pencil?

Removing eyeliner pencil can be tricky, but with the right tools and techniques, it can be done without damaging your eyelashes. Start by soaking a cotton pad in warm water, and then gently place it over your eyeliner. Apply a small amount of makeup remover or oil-based cleanser to the pad, and let it sit for a few seconds. Gently wipe the pad over your eyeliner, repeating the process until the pencil is completely removed. You can also use a Q-tip with a small amount of makeup remover or cleanser to clean the inner corner of your eyelid and the waterline. 

If you're still having trouble, you can try using a makeup remover wipe or micellar water with a cotton pad. Avoid rubbing your eyes vigorously, as it can cause irritation or breakage of your eyelashes. Instead, gently pat the area with a clean, damp cloth to remove any remaining residue. It's always best to remove your eyeliner before going to bed to avoid any irritation or discomfort. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Eyeliner+Pencil"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Eyeliner-Pencil-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Eyeliner-Pencil-6" height="540"></a></div>


### How do I store my eyeliner pencil?

Storing your eyeliner pencil properly is essential to maintain its quality and prevent it from drying out. Keep your eyeliner pencil in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight or heat sources. Avoid storing it in your pocket or makeup bag, as this can cause it to smudge or break. A pencil case or makeup organizer is perfect for storing your eyeliner pencils, ensuring they stay clean, sharp, and ready for use. 

If you're using a retractable eyeliner pencil, always make sure to retract the tip after use to prevent it from drying out. You can also store your eyeliner pencils vertically, allowing the tip to air out and preventing it from rolling on its side. Remember to clean your eyeliner pencil regularly to avoid bacteria buildup and maintain its quality. 


### What is the best way to sharpen an eyeliner pencil?

Sharpening an eyeliner pencil can be tricky, but it's essential to maintain a sharp tip for precise application. Use a pencil sharpener specifically designed for eyeliner pencils, and always hold the pencil firmly and at a slight angle. Avoid applying too much pressure, as this can cause the pencil to break or dull the tip. You can also use a small knife or X-Acto blade to sharpen the tip, but be careful and use a light touch. 

Alternatively, you can wet the tip of the pencil with water or eyeliner pencil sharpening spray to make it glide more smoothly. Gently pull the pencil along the sharpener, making sure not to press too hard. You can also use the angled tip of the pencil to create a precise point for a more defined line. Always remember to store your sharpened pencil tip down to prevent it from drying out.
