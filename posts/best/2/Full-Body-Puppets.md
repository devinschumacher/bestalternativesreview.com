### [Ventriloquist 25" Angel Full Body Puppet](https://serp.ly/amazon/Full+Body+Puppets?utm\_term=ventriloquist-25-angel-full-body-puppet)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Full+Body+Puppets?utm_term=ventriloquist-25-angel-full-body-puppet"><img alt="25-angel-full-body-ventriloquist-style-puppet-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/25-angel-full-body-ventriloquist-style-puppet-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

A few weeks ago, I had the pleasure of trying out the 25" Angel, Full Body, Ventriloquist Style Puppet from Silly Puppets. This puppet is pretty impressive - its full-body design makes it look and feel much more lifelike than some other puppets on the market, and it's surprisingly lightweight. 

One of the first things I noticed about this puppet was the easy-to-move mouth. It was a breeze to get the mouth to move in a natural-looking way, and it made my shows way more entertaining. With the hand entry through the back of the puppet, I found it super comfortable to control, even during long performances. 

However, I also noticed that the arm control rod is the only feature included to help you move the puppet. I wish they'd included two rods for more flexibility, but overall, it's still quite functional. Speaking of functionality, I must admit I was slightly disappointed to discover that the dress and wings are not removable or changeable. As a user, I felt like having the flexibility to change up the look of the puppet would have added even more value to this product. 

Despite these couple of drawbacks, the Silly Puppets Angel, Full Body, Ventriloquist Style Puppet proved to be a high-quality, entertaining addition to my show. If you're looking for a ventriloquist-style puppet that looks impressive and is user-friendly, you might want to give this one a shot. Just remember that the dress and wings are a fixed feature, so plan accordingly!

The 25-inch size made it perfect for both beginners and experienced puppeteers, and the easy-to-move mouth made performing a seamless experience. 

I'd highly recommend this puppet for various settings, including school performances, talent shows, drama, therapy, and even entertaining kids at home. However, it's suitable for children ages 5 and up, with younger kids enjoying it if an adult operates it for them.

The puppet even comes with an arm control rod that clips onto either hand for a seamless operation. Its height, about 25 inches, is perfect for kids to play with and have fun. 

However, I also noticed that even though it's marketed as a full body puppet, the clothing size is limited to child size 18 months, which might be a letdown for some. Additionally, the lightweight design of just around 500g might not be ideal for those looking for a heavier, more sturdy feel.

However, the puppet's lightweight construction, while beneficial for maneuverability, made it feel a bit less sturdy than I would have liked. Despite this minor issue, the puppet's uniform and boots were a beautiful addition to its overall appearance, even though they were fixed and not removable. All in all, this puppet from Silly Puppets proved to be a great tool for educating kids while being entertaining and engaging at the same time.
