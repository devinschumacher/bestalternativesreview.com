### [Heartstopper Japanese Comic Book](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Heartstopper+Comic?utm\_term=heartstopper-japanese-comic-book)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Heartstopper+Comic?utm_term=heartstopper-japanese-comic-book"><img alt="---------1-book-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/---------1-book-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Heartstopper Comic took me on a rollercoaster of emotions as I was drawn into the poignant story of Charlie, a gay student at an all-boys school with a dark past, and Nick, the rugby-loving, kind-hearted boy who soon becomes his very best friend. The graphic novel doesn't shy away from tackling real-life issues such as acceptance, sexiness, coming out, and prejudice. 

What stood out to me was the strong focus on friendship and the power of acceptance. The various LGBTQ+ characters, including Charlie, Nick, and others, contribute to the richness of this world and make Heartstopper Comic a must-read for anyone looking to broaden their understanding and appreciation of the LGBTQ+ community. 

However, if you're a fan of manga with a right-to-left reading direction, you might find it a bit jarring to switch to left-to-right format as the author, Alice Oseman, is British. Despite this small inconvenience, Heartstopper Comic is a captivating and heartwarming story that I couldn't put down.

Overall, the Heartstopper Series Volume 1-4 books collection is a beautifully crafted exploration of love, friendship, and the challenges we face in our early years. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a heartfelt and thought-provoking read.
