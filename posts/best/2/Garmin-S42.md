As someone who's always on the go, I've found the Garmin Instinct 2S to be a reliable and stylish companion. With its sleek design and rugged build, this watch never fails to impress. I particularly love its battery life, which can last up to 21 days in smartwatch mode and 22 hours in GPS mode.

Another great feature is the built-in sports apps. Whether I'm running, biking, swimming, or doing strength training, the watch has everything I need to track my progress. Plus, its VO2 Max feature helps me understand my body better and push myself to the next level. 

However, there were a few drawbacks I encountered. Firstly, the smart notifications while paired with my smartphone were a bit delayed at times, so I missed out on some important messages.

### [Refurbished Garmin S42 Golfing GPS with Polished Silver and White Band](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Garmin+S42?utm\_term=refurbished-garmin-s42-golfing-gps-with-polished-silver-and-white-band)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Garmin+S42?utm_term=refurbished-garmin-s42-golfing-gps-with-polished-silver-and-white-band"><img alt="refurbished-garmin-010-02572-11-approach-s42-polished-silver-with-white-band-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/refurbished-garmin-010-02572-11-approach-s42-polished-silver-with-white-band-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried this Refurbished Garmin 010-02572-11 Approach S42 Polished Silver with White Band. It's a GPS golf smartwatch, which I found quite impressive. With over 42,000 CourseView maps worldwide, I could easily access information about golf courses right on my wrist. Green View feature was particularly useful – it allowed me to manually pin position for distances to the front, middle, and back of the green, as well as hazards and doglegs. 

The AutoShot round analyzer was also a great feature. It automatically recorded detected shot distances and paired with optional Approach CT10 club tracking sensors for more automatic game tracking capabilities. However, I found that the distances were sometimes slightly off by as much as 30 yards. 

One issue I encountered was with the capacitive touch display. Wearing the watch on the inside of my wrist caused the display to change or scroll by itself, which was quite annoying. 

In terms of build quality, the watch seemed well made. But some features like the complicated watch interface made me wish for a simpler design. 

Overall, it was a good experience trying out this GPS golf smartwatch. There were some minor challenges, but the product delivered most of what it promised.

Its unique decorative lens reveals a bright touchscreen display that complements any outfit. The small, 34mm watch case makes it perfect for those with smaller wrists, and the included Italian leather band adds a touch of elegance. 

One of the standout features for me was the health tracking capabilities. The Lily tracked my steps, energy level, heart rate, stress, sleep quality, hydration, respiration, menstrual cycle, and pulse ox. It even had built-in apps for yoga, walking, cardio, and mindful breathing. Pairing the watch with my smartphone allowed me to receive notifications for incoming calls, text messages, and calendar reminders, making it easy to stay connected. 

However, there were a few downsides to this smartwatch. The battery life, while impressive with up to 5 days of usage, seemed to drain faster when I used the touch screen more frequently. Additionally, the touch screen itself could be sensitive at times, often registering taps that I didn't intend to make. 

Overall, the Garmin Lily - Classic Edition is a fashionable and functional smartwatch that offers a range of health tracking features. Its small size and stylish design make it a great choice for those looking for a smartwatch that doesn't compromise on style. While there are a few drawbacks, like the sensitive touch screen and faster battery drain, overall, I've been pleasantly surprised by this little gem.
