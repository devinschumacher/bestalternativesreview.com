### [Tracker Safe Security Medium Capacity Biometric Safe for Home or Vehicle](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Gun+Safe+Under+500?utm\_term=tracker-safe-security-medium-capacity-biometric-safe-for-home-or-vehicle)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Gun+Safe+Under+500?utm_term=tracker-safe-security-medium-capacity-biometric-safe-for-home-or-vehicle"><img alt="tracker-safe-security-safe-s19-b2-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tracker-safe-security-safe-s19-b2-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Tracker Safe S19-B2 is an impressive security safe, perfect for storing your valuables, particularly firearms and ammo. With its electronic, passcode lock, you can rest assured that your belongings are secure, and users can even register their fingerprints to access the safe with ease. However, one drawback is the lack of biometric fingerprint support in certain situations, which might be a dealbreaker for some users. 

After using the Tracker Safe S19-B2 in my daily life, I've found that the biometric aspect could be a bit finicky at times. It wasn't always clear which finger the safe was using to register your print, and there was a minor issue of the safe potentially locking my valuables inside, which is never a fun experience. Of course, this could just have been a one-off situation. 

On the plus side, the size of the safe was ideal for storing my items - it wasn't too small or too large. The front opening was straightforward and convenient to use, making it easy to keep track of what's inside. The battery indicator was also a pleasant feature, as it made it simpler to monitor its power level and avoid any unpleasant surprises. 

A minor concern I did have with the Tracker Safe S19-B2 was the door's thickness. It felt a bit thin and flimsy against my other safes, which gave me cause to wonder about its resilience against potential intruders. Nonetheless, it still met my needs, and I was able to bolt it down to secure it even further. 

Overall, the Tracker Safe S19-B2 isn't a perfect solution, but it definitely holds its own as a reliable security safe. Its size, features, and reasonable price point make it a strong contender for anyone in the market for a safe. With a few minor tweaks here and there, this safe could be even more impressive.

The fully programmable electronic lock was a nice touch, providing an extra layer of security. But what really stood out was the impressive fire protection, boasting 45 minutes of protection up to 1400°F. 

However, like any product, it wasn't without its flaws. The safe was a bit heavy to move around, so make sure you have a strong and sturdy place to put it. Additionally, while the exterior is great, it could use better ventilation inside the safe to maintain a comfortable temperature for your firearms.

### [Affordable Firearms Storage: American Furniture Classics 10 Gun Cabinet](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Gun+Safe+Under+500?utm\_term=affordable-firearms-storage-american-furniture-classics-10-gun-cabinet)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Gun+Safe+Under+500?utm_term=affordable-firearms-storage-american-furniture-classics-10-gun-cabinet"><img alt="american-furniture-classics-10-gun-cabinet-brown-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/american-furniture-classics-10-gun-cabinet-brown-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

This American Furniture Classics 10 Gun Cabinet has been a part of my daily life recently, and let me tell you, it has its pros and cons. Firstly, I must admit that I was initially impressed by the solid wood and wood veneers. The cabinet is richly finished and, for its price range, it seemed like a good deal. The felt-lined barrel rest and fully locking cabinetry added to the security and functionality, which were much appreciated. 

However, there were some drawbacks that became apparent during the assembly process. The pre-drilled holes for the door hinges were missing, making it quite inconvenient for someone like me without a drill. The weight of the glass made the cabinet top-heavy, which meant that it would be safer to secure it to the wall. I did find the instruction to do so, thankfully, as I was worried about the stability of the cabinet. 

Lastly, the slots for holding the barrels were not aligned properly, causing the guns to be crooked when stored. Although this might not be a major concern for some, it did affect the overall appeal and organization of my storage. 

In conclusion, while there were some positive aspects to this American Furniture Classics Gun Cabinet, I couldn't overlook the missing holes, top-heaviness, and incorrectly aligned slots. It's a good option if you're looking for easy-to-assemble furniture but be prepared for some issues concerning sturdiness and storage.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Gun+Safe+Under+500?utm_term=high-quality-5-gun-metal-security-cabinet-with-3-point-locking-system"><img alt="american-furniture-classics-5-gun-starter-metal-security-cabinet-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/american-furniture-classics-5-gun-starter-metal-security-cabinet-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the American Furniture Classics 5 Gun Starter Metal Security Cabinet from Dick's Sporting Goods. My experience with it has been less than pleasant. 

Upon opening the cabinet, I discovered that the lock mechanism casing was already broken, with pieces of the lock inside a small baggy. I contacted Dick's Sporting Goods and was told that if I returned the item, a refund would take approximately two to three weeks because they would have to verify it before processing the refund. This seems disappointing and unnecessary on their part. 

However, I can say that the cabinet itself appears sturdily made with high-quality black powder-coated paint, a soft foam barrel rest, and a carpeted floor to protect my firearms. I only hope that the company takes steps to ensure that such mishaps do not happen again in the future. Overall, I feel this product did not live up to my expectations and wouldn't recommend it to others.
