As a student, I can't help but adore these Enday 1.5-inch [binders](https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativesreview.com/blob/main/posts/best/1/Binders.md). They've made organizing my schoolwork much easier and more stylish. Whether I'm using them for notes, handouts, or even personal doodles, I've found these 3-rings to hold up well throughout the year. The transparent non-stick cover is a fantastic feature, making it super easy to spot my binders on the shelves. 

Another bonus is the two handy pockets on the side. They come in super handy for keeping things like pens, pencils, and highlighters right at my fingertips. And for those worried about safety, these binders are PVC-free and their inner board is made of 100% recycled material with a tear-resistant cover. It's incredible to see how eco-friendly they are! 

However, there's one area where these binders could use improvement. I've noticed that the rings sometimes get a little stuck, especially after using them for a while. It can be a bit frustrating when I'm trying to add or remove papers, and I've had to be a bit more careful not to rip anything. 

But overall, these Enday 3-ring binders are a great addition to my school supplies. The mix of style and functionality makes them a must-have for any student or professional looking to stay organized and looking good while doing it.
