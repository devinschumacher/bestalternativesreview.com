Its foundry-seasoned finish with Lodge's special vegetable oil formula ensures an easy, non-stick surface for effortless food preparation.

### [Lodge 9.25 Inch Round Cast Iron Serving Griddle for Induction Cooktops](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lodge+Griddle?utm\_term=lodge-9-25-inch-round-cast-iron-serving-griddle-for-induction-cooktops)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lodge+Griddle?utm_term=lodge-9-25-inch-round-cast-iron-serving-griddle-for-induction-cooktops"><img alt="lodge-logic-cast-iron-9-1-4-round-griddle-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lodge-logic-cast-iron-9-1-4-round-griddle-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out this Lodge Logic Cast Iron Round Griddle, and I must say, it's been a game changer in my kitchen. Its versatile use makes it perfect for serving various dishes, from burgers and fries to sizzling fajitas. It works great on different cooktops, stovetops, grills, and even over campfires. 

One aspect of this griddle that stood out to me is its durability. It is built to last for years, and with proper care, it can become a cherished family heirloom. However, it does come pre-seasoned, but I found that lightly coating it with vegetable oil before use helps to prevent food from sticking even better. 

Cleaning the griddle after use is a breeze, as well. Using a stiff nylon brush and hot water does the trick. But, remember to avoid using soap or harsh detergents, as they can harm the griddle's surface. 

Overall, my experience with this Lodge Logic Cast Iron Round Griddle has been positive. It's a great addition to any kitchen, providing convenience and versatility. The only minor drawback is that it comes without a wood underliner, which some reviewers have mentioned. Other than that, it's a high-quality product from a reputable brand that's worth the investment.

Remember to dry and rub with cooking oil to maintain its quality. 

The only major hiccup I faced? Getting used to the size. While it's great for cooking several ingredients simultaneously, the dimensions are a little deceptive. It's smaller than expected, so I had to make some adjustments when cooking bacon. But overall, it's a fantastic addition to any kitchen. Whether you're a professional chef or just a passionate home cook, the Lodge Chef Collection Griddle is a must-have.

However, hand wash with hot water and a stiff brush is a must to maintain its pristine condition. 

In my experience, the only downside is the smaller cooking area compared to the dimensions stated in the description.

## Buyer's Guide

A lodge griddle is a versatile cooking surface designed to handle a variety of food items. With these griddles available in different sizes and materials, it is essential to think about important features when deciding to buy. In this guide, we will highlight important aspects of lodge griddles to help you find the perfect one for your needs. 


### Material

Lodge griddles come in two primary materials: cast iron and steel. Cast iron griddles offer even heating and high durability but are usually heavy, needing extra effort to move around. On the other hand, steel griddles provide similar performance while being lighter and more user-friendly. Weigh your preference between ease and cooking performance when picking a material for your lodge griddle.

### Size

Lodge griddles come in various sizes, ranging from compact models suitable for small living spaces to large ones that accommodate multiple dishes simultaneously. Determine the size of your griddle based on the available counter space and your cooking needs. Before purchasing, give careful consideration to the dimensions and weight of the griddle to ensure it fits appropriately and is easy to maneuver. 


### Seasoning

Proper seasoning is vital for your lodge griddle's performance and longevity. Although most come pre-seasoned, it's wise to re-season them before use. This process helps develop a natural non-stick surface, preventing food from adhering and making cleaning more accessible. Follow the manufacturer's guidelines on seasoning your lodge griddle for the best results.

### What is a Lodge Griddle?

A Lodge Griddle is a versatile cooking tool that features a flat, cast iron surface designed for a variety of applications. It can be used on a stovetop, over a campfire, or on a grill. This durable and heat-evenly-distributed surface is perfect for cooking a wide range of delicious dishes, from breakfast items like pancakes and bacon to lunch and dinner choices like burgers and hot dogs. 

Available in sizes ranging from 12-inch to 20-inch models, Lodge Griddles are made from easy-to-maintain cast iron. The cast iron surface develops a natural non-stick seasoning when properly cared for, making it a breeze to clean and a joy to cook on. 


### Is a Lodge Griddle suitable for outdoor cooking?

Certainly! Lodge Griddles are designed to be used outdoors, for camping trips, backyard barbecues, and more. Their heat-resistant construction allows for even heat distribution and retention, all while remaining strong enough to withstand the intense heat found in a campfire or grill. To get the most out of your griddle, consider adding a campfire tripod or a grill attachment to suspend it above the flames while still providing the heat you need to cook. Just remember to use a fireproof glove or oven mitt when handling the griddle, as it will become very hot during use.

### Can a Lodge Griddle be used on a stovetop?

Absolutely! Many Lodge Griddle models feature heat-resistant handles and a flat base designed to sit directly on a stovetop. To ensure even and consistent heating, make sure to evenly distribute the heat across the burner on which the griddle rests. Always use a stove-top griddle guard or trivet to protect your cooktop and maintain the integrity of your griddle. 

When using your Lodge Griddle on the stovetop, start with a low heat setting and allow the griddle to warm up gradually. This helps to prevent warping or damage from occurring. Once the griddle is properly preheated, cook your favorite breakfast, lunch, or dinner items! Remember to use a spatula or flipper with a heat-resistant handle to avoid any burns while cooking. 


### How should I season a Lodge Griddle?

Seasoning a Lodge Griddle is a critical step to preventing rust and ensuring a natural, non-stick surface. To do this, clean the griddle thoroughly with warm water and a gentle, non-toxic soap. Rinse the griddle well and pat it dry with a paper towel. Apply a thin layer of cooking oil, such as vegetable or canola oil, to the entire surface of the griddle, ensuring even coverage. 

Next, place the oiled griddle on a stovetop or in an oven set to 375¬∞F (190¬∞C) for about 30-60 minutes. The heat will help to create a seasoned coating on the surface. Once complete, remove the griddle from the heat and let it cool completely. Wipe off any excess oil with a paper towel, and your Lodge Griddle is ready for use!

### How should I store my Lodge Griddle?

Properly storing your Lodge Griddle helps to maintain its seasoning and prevent rust. After each use, allow the griddle to cool completely and wipe off any food residue using a paper towel. Avoid washing your Lodge Griddle with soap or using a dishwasher, as these can strip the seasoning. 

When storing the griddle, place it in a dry, well-ventilated area, keeping it away from direct sunlight or extreme moisture. To maintain the seasoning and protect the cast iron surface, apply a thin layer of cooking oil to the surface, using a paper towel for even coverage. 


### What are some common mistakes to avoid when using a Lodge Griddle?

There are several mistakes to avoid when using a Lodge Griddle. First, heat the griddle evenly, whether on a stovetop or over an open flame, to prevent warping or buckling. Second, avoid using metal utensils or harsh cleaners, as they can damage the seasoning. 

Additionally, never place a hot griddle directly on a cold or wet surface, as this can cause the griddle to warp or crack due to the sudden temperature change. Lastly, avoid storing a wet griddle without proper seasoning, as this can lead to rust formation and damage the cast iron surface over time.
