In general, most canisters are dishwasher-safe, but some delicate materials like ceramic may require hand washing to preserve their decorative features.

1. Dishwasher-safe: Place your canister on the top rack of the dishwasher to avoid damage to the seal or rubber gasket.

 

2. Handwashing: Use warm, soapy water and a gentle sponge or cloth to handwash your canister gently.

 

3. Rinse and air-dry: Rinse your canister thoroughly with clean water and let it air dry completely before using it again to prevent any residue or mold formation.

### How to Correctly Store Your Food in Kitchen Canisters

To ensure optimal storage conditions, it's essential to follow these guidelines when storing food items in your kitchen canisters:

1. Dry and cool: Store your food items dry and cool to prevent the buildup of condensation and humidity inside the canister, which can lead to spoilage and mold growth.

2. Avoid overfilling: Overfilling your canister can create pressure and damage the seal, making it harder to maintain airtight storage. It's also important to leave enough space inside the canister for food items to expand or contract with temperature and humidity fluctuations.


### Airtight Versus Non-Airtight Containers: The Differences Explained

The key difference between airtight and non-airtight containers lies in the presence of a seal that prevents air and moisture from entering the canister. Airtight containers are designed to maintain the freshness and quality of dry food items by minimizing exposure to air and moisture.

1. Airtight containers: These containers preserve the freshness of your stored food and keep it tasty for longer periods by reducing oxidation.

 

2. Non-airtight containers: These containers are usually more transparent, designed for fresh produce storage. They allow for excess moisture release, which helps to extend the shelf life of your produce.

Although non-airtight containers are great for fresh produce, they're not suitable for storing dry food items as they can cause spoilage and loss of flavor due to exposure to air and moisture.
