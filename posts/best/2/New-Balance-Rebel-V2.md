<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/New+Balance+Rebel+V2?utm_term=new-balance-fuelcell-trainer-v2-mens-running-shoes"><img alt="new-balance-mens-fuelcell-trainer-v2-white-blue-size-11-wide-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/new-balance-mens-fuelcell-trainer-v2-white-blue-size-11-wide-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Ariaprene synthetic foam fabric tongue and gore create a snug, supportive fit that hugs your foot. The no-sew overlays give the sneakers a sleek look, too. 

But the cherry on top? The cushioning in the midsole and heel! It increases comfort like no other. 

Whether it's a workout day or an adventure outdoors, these sneakers are lightweight, flexible, and super durable. Highly recommend! 


### [New Balance Men's 626v2 Black Running Shoe](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/New+Balance+Rebel+V2?utm\_term=new-balance-mens-626v2-black-running-shoe)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/New+Balance+Rebel+V2?utm_term=new-balance-mens-626v2-black-running-shoe"><img alt="new-balance-mens-626v2-black-9-5-4e-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/new-balance-mens-626v2-black-9-5-4e-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

In my daily life, I've found the New Balance Men's 626v2 to be a reliable and durable choice for my industrial work environment. The lightweight design and supportive features make it ideal for long workdays on my feet. The leather upper provides a polished finish and adds a touch of style to my uniform, while the slip-resistant bottom comes in handy on slippery surfaces in the workshop. 

One of the standout features of these safety sneakers is the ABZORB midsole, which effectively attenuates shock and keeps my feet comfortable throughout the day. Another plus is the non-marking lug rubber outsole, which offers superior traction on oily and wet surfaces, making it a safe choice for my job. However, the leather used in the shoe can be a bit stiff and may not stretch enough for those with bone spurs or bunions, as some reviewers pointed out. 

The padded collar and tongue offer protection and support to the top and back of my foot, but I would have appreciated thicker padding on the tongue, as some users mentioned. Additionally, the lace-up design can take a while to break in, but once it does, the shoes are very comfortable. 

Overall, the New Balance Men's 626v2 has been a reliable and comfortable choice for my workday, and I would recommend it to others in need of durable, non-slip safety footwear.

### [New Balance Men's FuelCell Rebel V2 Performance Running Shoes](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/New+Balance+Rebel+V2?utm\_term=new-balance-mens-fuelcell-rebel-v2-performance-running-shoes)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/New+Balance+Rebel+V2?utm_term=new-balance-mens-fuelcell-rebel-v2-performance-running-shoes"><img alt="new-balance-mens-fuelcell-rebel-v2-running-shoes-black-blue-size-11-6" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/new-balance-mens-fuelcell-rebel-v2-running-shoes-black-blue-size-11-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Lacing up the New Balance Fuel Cell Rebel V2 for the first time, it's impossible not to feel a sense of excitement. The black woven design running shoes have a sleek, stylish look, and the cushioned footbed feels incredibly soft. As I begin to run, the shoe's true potential shines through. The high-rebound Fuel Cell midsole provides unparalleled energy return with every step, transforming my run into a bouncy, smooth experience. 

The shoes' lightweight feel is a welcome change from previous models, which are so often bulky and unresponsive. This lightweight construction also makes the Rebel V2 incredibly comfortable, thanks to its breathable mesh upper that wraps around my feet like a cozy blanket. 

However, my experience with the Rebel V2 isn't without its drawbacks. Despite the deconstructed heel and molded collar foam for extra support, I've found that the shoe's lockdown can be a bit sloppy during longer runs. Additionally, the quick-to-fall-apart upper around the forefoot requires me to be more mindful of my stride and gait. 

Furthermore, the shoe's textured and patterned outsole has proven to be a bit aggressive for my preference, leading to increased friction on certain surfaces. This aggressive tread also makes the Rebel V2 less versatile than I would like, as it struggles to transition seamlessly from pavement to trail. 

Despite these minor concerns, overall, my experience with the New Balance Fuel Cell Rebel V2 has been an enjoyable one. The shoe's cushioning, responsiveness, and lightweight design make it a fantastic choice for shorter, faster runs. I also appreciate the bold branding and asymmetrical color blocking, which give the shoes a uniquely stylish appearance. If New Balance can iron out the few issues I’ve encountered, the Rebel V2 could be a truly remarkable running shoe.

I was thrilled to try the New Balance FuelCell Rebel v3 after hearing so many great things about it. Upon putting them on, I immediately noticed how light they were, which was perfect for my fast runs. The high-energy return FuelCell foam cushioning was a game-changer, making me want to push my runs further than ever before. 

One of my favorite features was the molded collar foam, which provided a snug and secure fit, allowing me to maintain control of my foot even during intense workouts. The lace closure was also a welcome addition, providing a custom fit that ensured my feet stayed in place throughout each run. 

Unfortunately, I did experience a few downsides. The first was the durability of the shoes. Despite the NDurance rubber outsole technology, the high-wear areas of the shoe did not hold up as well as I had hoped, leading to the need for a replacement sooner than anticipated. This was a bit of a letdown, given the price point of the shoe. 

Another issue I faced was with the overall design. While the lightweight upper and gusseted tongue were great for a sleek and speedy fit, some users may have found them a bit too restrictive, especially during longer runs. 

Overall, despite the minor drawbacks, the New Balance FuelCell Rebel v3 was an impressive shoe that offered a unique blend of comfort, responsiveness, and performance. If you're looking for a lightweight, high-energy training shoe, this could be the perfect fit for you.

The New Balance Rave Run V2 is a perfect fit for my little one's wide feet. The x-wide sizing is much appreciated, as it is challenging to find shoes that actually fit due to my son's wide feet and braces.

Although I wished the Velcro strap was a bit wider and longer, it still did a great job of holding his feet steady throughout the day. The extra-wide design and comfortable fit make these shoes a must-have for my son, and I can't wait to see him continue to love these shoes!
