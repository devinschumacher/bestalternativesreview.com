My practical needs as well as the aesthetics of the room were both met with this coffee table. At a height of 18 inches and a length of 24 inches, it provides ample space for any occasional use, but without overwhelming the space. Its width of 46 inches gives just the right amount of surface area to display decorative items, while not appearing too large. A major highlight is that it does not come with a number of shelves or a table top shape, providing a clean, contemporary look. 

Another significant advantage is its ability to be used outside, making it an all-season piece of furniture. The coffee table is indeed a wonderful investment to bring a touch of class and sophistication to any home. But do remember to use it cautiously due to the potential risk of formaldehyde exposure.
