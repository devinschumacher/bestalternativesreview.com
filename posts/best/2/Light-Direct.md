### [Hampton Bay Flush Mount LED Ceiling Light with Frosted White Shade](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Light+Direct?utm\_term=hampton-bay-flush-mount-led-ceiling-light-with-frosted-white-shade)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Light+Direct?utm_term=hampton-bay-flush-mount-led-ceiling-light-with-frosted-white-shade"><img alt="hampton-bay-hb1023c-35-flaxmere-11-8-in-brushed-nickel-led-flush-mount-ceiling-light-with-frosted-wh-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hampton-bay-hb1023c-35-flaxmere-11-8-in-brushed-nickel-led-flush-mount-ceiling-light-with-frosted-wh-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a homeowner, I was in the market for a new ceiling light fixture for one of our hallway areas. After doing some research, I came across the Hampton Bay HB1023C-35 Flaxmere LED Flush Mount Ceiling Light with Frosted White Glass Shade. 

What stood out to me about this product was its low-profile design, which complements any décor style, and the fact that it's maintenance-free with an LED light that doesn't require any bulbs to be replaced. I also appreciated that it would be a perfect addition to the hallway, bedroom, and other areas of my home. 

Upon installation, I noticed that the flush mount easily mounted flush with the ceiling, and the low profile design kept it out of the way of closet doors. The brushed nickel finish looked great, and the frosted white glass shade diffused the light evenly, providing a warm and inviting glow. 

However, there were a few drawbacks worth mentioning. For example, the nut supporting the frosted glass shade had difficulties attaching to the supporting rod. I had to use some glue and duct tape to hold the nut in place until it dried. Another issue was the installation instructions; they provided a warning about the light being bright, which was a bit unnecessary and vague. 

All in all, this product is a great option for anyone looking for an elegant, modern, and energy-efficient ceiling light fixture. While it has its minor drawbacks, it has been a reliable addition to my home and has made my hallway area look more inviting.
