Metal rulers, on the other hand, tend to be more durable, which makes them ideal for constant use. Flexibility is also an essential factor. A flexible French curve ruler can be bent more easily for intricate designs without breaking or causing damage to the ruler. However, a rigid model can maintain its shape more accurately, making precise measurements simpler. 


### Flexibility vs. Rigidity: Choose Your Poise

When selecting a French curve ruler, flexibility vs. rigidity is a crucial factor. A flexible French curve ruler can be bent more effortlessly for intricate designs without breaking or causing damage to the ruler. This flexibility is particularly useful for inexperienced users or when accuracy is not a top priority. In contrast, a rigid French curve ruler maintains its shape more accurately, making precise measurements a breeze. Consider whether the flexibility or rigidity of the ruler aligns better with your skill level and project requirements.
