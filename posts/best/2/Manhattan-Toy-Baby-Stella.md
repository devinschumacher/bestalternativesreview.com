The Baby Stella Peach Doll from Manhattan Toy is an endearing addition to any little one's collection. This first baby doll, adorned with peach skin and light brown hair, is an ideal introduction to role-playing and nurturing. My granddaughter absolutely adores her Baby Stella doll, and the coordinating sleeveless blouse and gingham two-piece outfit provide a charming look. The pacifier that attaches magnetically to her mouth adds a nice touch, as well. 

What I appreciate the most is the soft texture of the doll, which is perfectly suitable for my granddaughter's age. The doll comes with a magnetic pacifier, which is a convenient and safe feature for young ones. However, I noticed that the facial magnet is more visible now, almost appearing like she has a little mustache. Nonetheless, this doll exceeds all safety standards, as expected from Manhattan Toy. 

One issue I encountered is that the pants and diaper sometimes fall down, requiring constant adjustments. But overall, I would recommend this doll to other families looking for a soft, lovable, and safe first baby doll. Little ones will love nurturing and caring for Baby Stella, as she offers endless possibilities for imaginative play.
