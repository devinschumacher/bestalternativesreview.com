### [Affordable Firearms Storage: American Furniture Classics 10 Gun Cabinet](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Gun+Safe+Furniture?utm\_term=affordable-firearms-storage-american-furniture-classics-10-gun-cabinet)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Gun+Safe+Furniture?utm_term=affordable-firearms-storage-american-furniture-classics-10-gun-cabinet"><img alt="american-furniture-classics-10-gun-cabinet-brown-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/american-furniture-classics-10-gun-cabinet-brown-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

This American Furniture Classics 10 Gun Cabinet has been a part of my daily life recently, and let me tell you, it has its pros and cons. Firstly, I must admit that I was initially impressed by the solid wood and wood veneers. The cabinet is richly finished and, for its price range, it seemed like a good deal. The felt-lined barrel rest and fully locking cabinetry added to the security and functionality, which were much appreciated. 

However, there were some drawbacks that became apparent during the assembly process. The pre-drilled holes for the door hinges were missing, making it quite inconvenient for someone like me without a drill. The weight of the glass made the cabinet top-heavy, which meant that it would be safer to secure it to the wall. I did find the instruction to do so, thankfully, as I was worried about the stability of the cabinet. 

Lastly, the slots for holding the barrels were not aligned properly, causing the guns to be crooked when stored. Although this might not be a major concern for some, it did affect the overall appeal and organization of my storage. 

In conclusion, while there were some positive aspects to this American Furniture Classics Gun Cabinet, I couldn't overlook the missing holes, top-heaviness, and incorrectly aligned slots. It's a good option if you're looking for easy-to-assemble furniture but be prepared for some issues concerning sturdiness and storage.

I recently purchased the American Furniture Classics 5 Gun Starter Metal Security Cabinet from Dick's Sporting Goods. My experience with it has been less than pleasant. 

Upon opening the cabinet, I discovered that the lock mechanism casing was already broken, with pieces of the lock inside a small baggy.

This seems disappointing and unnecessary on their part. 

However, I can say that the cabinet itself appears sturdily made with high-quality black powder-coated paint, a soft foam barrel rest, and a carpeted floor to protect my firearms. I only hope that the company takes steps to ensure that such mishaps do not happen again in the future. Overall, I feel this product did not live up to my expectations and wouldn't recommend it to others.
