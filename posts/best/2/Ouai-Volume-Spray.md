As someone who tried the Schwarzkopf Osis+ Volume Up Volume Booster Spray, I was pleasantly surprised by the weightless, long-lasting formula that instantly added texture and volume to my hair. The light, flexible hold was perfect for daily wear without weighing my hair down, while the all-hair types formula suited my locks perfectly. However, one con I discovered in my experience was that the spray seemed to leave my hair slightly dry, requiring more attention to conditioning. 

Nonetheless, this spray was an excellent addition to my daily hair care routine, adding just the right touch of volume and style.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Ouai+Volume+Spray?utm_term=travel-friendly-ouai-hair-oil-for-all-hair-types"><img alt="ouai-travel-size-hair-oil-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/ouai-travel-size-hair-oil-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

In my quest for a sleek and frizz-free mane, I recently tried out OUAI's Hair Oil Travel Size. This compact, ultra-hydrating hair oil works wonders on my locks, leaving them soft and shiny. Its floral-infused formula, featuring African galanga and a blend of ama oil and Asian borage oils, not only protects my strands from damage but also smooths them out, giving me a high gloss finish with minimal flyaways or split ends. 

What sets this hair oil apart is its lightweight feel and pleasant scent, which I appreciate in a product. It works beautifully on both wet and dry hair, and I've found that it helps control frizz and adds shine to my locks. As someone who tends to have greasy hair, I've been careful not to overuse it, but even a couple of drops are enough to make a noticeable difference. 

However, there are a few cons to mention. While I've enjoyed using this hair oil, I've noticed that it can sometimes make my hair feel a bit stiff and flakey if I use too much. Additionally, when using it as an overnight treatment, I've noticed that my hair can feel a bit greasier the next morning. It's also important to note that the price point is quite high for a relatively small bottle of product. 

Overall, I'm pleased with my experience using OUAI's Hair Oil Travel Size. Its ability to protect and enhance my hair's natural shine and texture has made it a welcome addition to my daily hair care routine. While there are a few drawbacks to consider, I believe the benefits outweigh the cons for those looking to achieve a sleek, frizz-free, and healthy-looking mane.
