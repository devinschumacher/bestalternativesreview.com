<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Ninja+Bullet+Blender?utm_term=ninja-professional-plus-72-oz-blender-with-auto-iq-technology-and-8-1-lb-countertop-blender"><img alt="ninja-professional-plus-blender-with-auto-iq-and-72-ounce-total-crushing-pitcher-lid-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ninja-professional-plus-blender-with-auto-iq-and-72-ounce-total-crushing-pitcher-lid-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the pleasure of using the Ninja Professional Plus Blender for my daily smoothie routine. The first thing I noticed was its powerful 1200-watt motor that was able to crush ice in seconds, making my smoothies even more delightful. The 72 oz. XL pitcher was perfect for my family, as it allowed me to easily prepare large batches of our favorite beverages. 

One of the highlights of the blender was its easy-to-clean components and the included cookbook with 15 recipes to help inspire me in the kitchen. While the stainless steel blades were efficient in blending my ingredients, I found them a bit tricky to clean around – especially when it came to handling the sharp edges. 

The blender was well-built with a sleek and modern design. However, I did find it a bit on the heavier side, which might not be ideal for those with mobility issues or weaker upper body strength. The Auto-iQ intelligent blending programs made the process of creating my favorite smoothies and frozen drinks rather simple, and the pitcher's locking lid provided me with peace of mind while blending. 

Overall, the Ninja Professional Plus Blender was a reliable and powerful addition to my kitchen, and I appreciated its ability to create a variety of tasty beverages for my family. While there were a few minor drawbacks – such as the difficulty in cleaning the blades and its relatively high weight – the Pros definitely outweighed the Cons in my experience. 


### [Ninja SS351 Foodi Power Blender & Processor System: The Ultimate 2-in-1 Blender and Processor Solution](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Ninja+Bullet+Blender?utm\_term=ninja-ss351-foodi-power-blender-processor-system-the-ultimate-2-in-1-blender-and-processor-solution)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Ninja+Bullet+Blender?utm_term=ninja-ss351-foodi-power-blender-processor-system-the-ultimate-2-in-1-blender-and-processor-solution"><img alt="ninja-ss351-foodi-power-blender-processor-system-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ninja-ss351-foodi-power-blender-processor-system-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Ninja SS351 Foodi Power Blender & Processor System has been a game-changer in my kitchen. I've been using it for a few months now, and I must say it's one of the best blenders I've used in the mid-tier range. One of the things I love about it is its sleek and modern design. The lid with the locking mechanism and the spout is very functional, although it can sometimes be a bit confusing to tell if the spout is locked down correctly. 

One of the standout features of this blender is its powerful performance. I use it to blend frozen fruit and ice with ease, something I didn't find in other blenders I've used in the past. The built-in twist tamper makes it simple to push ingredients down towards the high-speed blades, ensuring I get even and thick results. The smartTORQUE technology also allows for variable speed control, which is perfect for my needs. 

However, this blender isn't flawless. I've encountered some issues with the lid and the suction cups breaking within a short period of time. I initially faced a situation where a kitchen full of smoke occurred, and my main concern has been the suction cups being difficult to release. 

When it comes to cleaning, the blender is quite easy to clean as it features dishwasher-safe parts, which saves me a lot of time and effort. The Hybrid Edge blades make for a complete and thorough chopping, which is excellent for recipes like onions and peppers. The Nutrient Extraction Cup with a spout lid is also a useful addition when I need to make extractions like protein shakes. 

In conclusion, the Ninja SS351 Foodi Power Blender & Processor System is a powerful, sleek, and easy-to-clean blender in the mid-tier range. Its versatility in functions and its performance when handling frozen fruit and ice stand out, but I do urge caution when dealing with the lid and suction cups, as they may break within a short period of time.

However, there are a couple of downsides to the Ninja Professional Plus Blender DUO with Auto-iQ. It can be quite noisy, which can be a bit of an issue if you're using it early in the morning or late at night.
