### [Microban Disinfectant Spray with Citrus Freshness, 2-Pack](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Microban+Disinfectant+Spray?utm\_term=microban-disinfectant-spray-with-citrus-freshness-2-pack)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Microban+Disinfectant+Spray?utm_term=microban-disinfectant-spray-with-citrus-freshness-2-pack"><img alt="15-oz-24-hour-citrus-sanitizing-aerosol-disinfectant-spray-2-pack-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/15-oz-24-hour-citrus-sanitizing-aerosol-disinfectant-spray-2-pack-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Microban 24 Sanitizer is a 2-in-1 aerosol disinfectant that offers 24-hour protection against bacterial growth on hard surfaces and antifungal protection for up to 7 days on hard surfaces and 28 days on fabric. This highly effective disinfectant is EPA approved, without containing bleach, phosphates, or nonylphenol ethoxylates, and complies with VOC regulations in all 50 states. 

This sanitizer provides a 24-hour residual protection against bacterial growth and eliminates 99.9% of bacteria, fungi, mold and mildew, viruses, and more. It also specifically aids in the combat against the virus that causes COVID-19. The citrus scent adds a fresh and inviting touch to the product. 

However, it's worth mentioning, despite the long-lasting protection, it's not without its downsides. The product offers no 24-hour residual protection against any viruses. Also, the antifungal effect for hard surfaces lasts for only 7 days while on fabrics it lasts for 28 days. 

Despite these factors, many users have reported its effectiveness, praising its long-lasting protection, pleasant scent, and its convenience in different settings like bathrooms, floors, and kitchens.
