When I first saw the Nike Park 20 Rain Jacket in my hands, I was excited to try it out. The black and white color scheme made it look sleek and stylish, but also functional for rainy days. The first thing I noticed was the lightweight feel of the fabric, which made it perfect for layering under my regular jacket during wet weather.

However, there were also a few drawbacks to this jacket. The lack of a hood was one of my main concerns, as I found myself wishing for one on multiple occasions when I was walking in the rain. Additionally, the regular fit of the jacket was a bit snug, especially around the arms and shoulders. This made it difficult to move freely or take off easily when I was in a hurry. 

Overall, I'd say the Nike Park 20 Rain Jacket is a decent choice for those looking for a lightweight, water-repellent option for occasional rainy days. While it has some drawbacks, such as the lack of a hood and snug fit, its stylish design and functionality make it a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to keep dry in the rain.
