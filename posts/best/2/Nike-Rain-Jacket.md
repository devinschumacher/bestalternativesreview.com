When I first saw the Nike Park 20 Rain Jacket in my hands, I was excited to try it out. The black and white color scheme made it look sleek and stylish, but also functional for rainy days. The first thing I noticed was the lightweight feel of the fabric, which made it perfect for layering under my regular jacket during wet weather. 

One of the main highlights of this rain jacket is its water-repellent finish, which helped keep me dry even when I was caught in a light drizzle. The side pockets were handy for storing small items like my phone and a few extra snacks, making it a convenient option for daily wear. 

However, there were also a few drawbacks to this jacket. The lack of a hood was one of my main concerns, as I found myself wishing for one on multiple occasions when I was walking in the rain. Additionally, the regular fit of the jacket was a bit snug, especially around the arms and shoulders. This made it difficult to move freely or take off easily when I was in a hurry. 

Overall, I'd say the Nike Park 20 Rain Jacket is a decent choice for those looking for a lightweight, water-repellent option for occasional rainy days. While it has some drawbacks, such as the lack of a hood and snug fit, its stylish design and functionality make it a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to keep dry in the rain.
