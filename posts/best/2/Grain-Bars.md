<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Grain+Bars?utm_term=kelloggs-nutri-grain-elevenses-raisin-bakes-6-pack"><img alt="kelloggs-nutri-grain-elevenses-bars-raisin-bakes-6-x-45g-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/kelloggs-nutri-grain-elevenses-bars-raisin-bakes-6-x-45g-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried a Kellogg's Nutri-Grain Raisin Bakes for a quick and yummy breakfast option. As a busy mom, I was looking for a satisfying and fiber-filled treat to start my day, and these bars definitely hit the spot! The blend of wholegrain oats, wheat, and fruity raisins creates a soft and moist texture that's hard to resist. 

To be honest, I was a bit disappointed as I couldn't find the promised "oats sprinkled on top" as they used to have in the past. However, I still found it to be a tasty and filling snack. I also noticed that the packaging comes with only 6 bars, which might not be enough for a week's worth of breakfast or snacks. 

Overall, I would recommend these Nutri-Grain Raisin Breakfast Bakes as a nutritious and delicious alternative to traditional cereal bars. Plus, they're great for those mornings when you need an extra energy boost before starting your day.
