### [Artist's Loft 18-Color Jelly Gouache Paint Set](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Gouache+Paint?utm\_term=artists-loft-18-color-jelly-gouache-paint-set)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Gouache+Paint?utm_term=artists-loft-18-color-jelly-gouache-paint-set"><img alt="artists-loft-jelly-gouache-18-color-paint-set-1-each-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/artists-loft-jelly-gouache-18-color-paint-set-1-each-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Artist's Loft Jelly Gouache 18-color Paint Set, and it became a staple in my art supplies collection. The set includes an assortment of 18 vibrant colors, each packed in a 0.77 fl. oz. (23 mL) container. The color selection is impressive, especially if you're just starting with gouache, as it provides a good range of hues for beginners to work with. 

What I loved most about this set is the plastic palette included, which makes mixing colors effortless. The paint itself is creamy and smooth, allowing for easy blending and application. The set also comes with a plastic case and palette, and I appreciate that it helps keep the paint fresh and prevents it from drying out when not in use. The fact that it conforms to ASTM D-4236 shows that it's a safe and trustworthy product. 

However, there were a few things I noticed that might be worth mentioning. Firstly, I found that the colors weren't as opaque as I'd hoped, especially some of the weaker hues like violet, cerulean, and greens. These colors require more layering to achieve full opacity, which can be a bit tedious at times. Apart from this, the paint does tend to dry lighter than how it looks when fully wet, similar to other gouache brands. 

Despite these small drawbacks, I was generally quite impressed with the quality of this product. It's ideal for beginners who want to try gouache at an affordable price. I would definitely recommend it, as long as you're aware of its limitations and approach it as a fun, budget-friendly option for art exploration. 


### [Schmincke Gouache Paint Binder - Ready to Use](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Gouache+Paint?utm\_term=schmincke-gouache-paint-binder-ready-to-use)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Gouache+Paint?utm_term=schmincke-gouache-paint-binder-ready-to-use"><img alt="schmincke-ready-to-use-gouache-paint-binder-200ml-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/schmincke-ready-to-use-gouache-paint-binder-200ml-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Schmincke gouache binder is a versatile and ready-to-use formula for creating velvety gouache-like colors. By combining pure artist pigments, it offers a rich, opaque finish that can be gently watered down for subtle effect. Its non-toxic and water-soluble nature makes it perfect for both children and adults to use. 

The binder's paste-like consistency makes it easy to mix with pigments, providing a wide range of color possibilities. For optimal results, it can be thinned with water. Shake well before use and clean your tools promptly to maintain the product's integrity. 

While the binder is water-resistant, it remains water-soluble for more extended drying time, ensuring enhanced permanence and durability. Schmincke is a reputable brand, known for its high-quality artists' materials. 

However, it should be noted that the product requires more preparation than standard gouache paints. Additionally, it comes with a thinner in the form of water, but for a larger volume, it could be beneficial to have a separate container or option for greater convenience. 

In summary, the Schmincke gouache binder is a high-quality, ready-to-use product that offers various color options for artists. With proper use and care, it can deliver long-lasting, vibrant results. 


### [Lascaux Raw Umber Gouache Paint - 85ml Tube](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Gouache+Paint?utm\_term=lascaux-raw-umber-gouache-paint-85ml-tube)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Gouache+Paint?utm_term=lascaux-raw-umber-gouache-paint-85ml-tube"><img alt="lascaux-gouache-85ml-raw-umber-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lascaux-gouache-85ml-raw-umber-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently started using Lascaux Gouache for my daily art projects and I must say, it's been a game-changer! The vibrant shades and rich hues this gouache provides make every piece I create stand out. 

One of the features that truly stands out is the intensity and purity of the colors. When I'm painting, the colors are so vivid that it feels like I'm blending my own pigments. It's like having a paintbox that never fades or runs dry. 

Another great thing about Lascaux Gouache is how economical it is—a little goes a long way. I've found that it lasts much longer than other acrylic paints I've used in the past, and the color payoff is fantastic. 

However, one thing that I noticed was that the paint can be a bit stubborn on some surfaces, especially when it comes to blending. It tends to thicken up after a while, which can make achieving a smooth finish a bit challenging. 

Overall, I'd recommend Lascaux Gouache to anyone looking for a reliable, long-lasting, and versatile paint option. It's perfect for both beginners and professionals alike, and the wide range of colors ensures that there's something for everyone. 


### [Talens Art Creation Gouache Paint Set - 12 Versatile Colors for Creative Artists](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Gouache+Paint?utm\_term=talens-art-creation-gouache-paint-set-12-versatile-colors-for-creative-artists)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Gouache+Paint?utm_term=talens-art-creation-gouache-paint-set-12-versatile-colors-for-creative-artists"><img alt="talens-art-creation-gouache-set-of-13" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/talens-art-creation-gouache-set-of-13/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Talens Art Creation Gouache set of 12, and I must say, it's been quite the experience! As an artist, I was really excited to try out this new set of gouache paints. The set includes a range of 12 vibrant colors, which definitely caught my attention. 

One of the features that stood out to me was the opacity of the paint. With just a few layers, the colors covered well and gave the canvas a matte finish without any unwanted brush strokes or scratches. And the best part? It's easy to use for both large color blocks and fine details. The paint can be diluted with water and mixed with other colors to create new shades, making it perfect for color mixing instruction. 

However, there were a few drawbacks I noticed while using the set. I found that the white color was quite streaky and uneven, which made it difficult to achieve the desired shade. Additionally, some colors, like the peach, had a strange texture and didn't apply well on the canvas. 

Overall, the Talens Art Creation Gouache set is a great value for the price and perfect for beginners or artists looking for a versatile set of paints. The colors are vibrant and mix well, and the matte finish is a plus. But if you're looking for a higher quality white and peach, you might want to consider another brand. 


### [Pebeo Studio Gouache: Rich, Intense Pigments for Artists](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Gouache+Paint?utm\_term=pebeo-studio-gouache-rich-intense-pigments-for-artists)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Gouache+Paint?utm_term=pebeo-studio-gouache-rich-intense-pigments-for-artists"><img alt="pebeo-220-ml-studio-gouache-permanent-white-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/pebeo-220-ml-studio-gouache-permanent-white-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Last week, I decided to try out the Pebeo Studio Gouache in Permanent White. I've experimented with various gouache paints in the past, and I have to say, the Pebeo brand is a game-changer. 

First off, the paint's consistency is super smooth and creamy, which makes it so easy for me to get the edge detailing I love on my illustrations. The coverage was quite impressive too—just one coat and my surface was fully covered, giving it a perfect matte finish. 

The Permanent White color is vibrant and rich, just like the other colors in the range. This feature was particularly impressive when I mixed it with other colors, and the end result was always a perfect balance of shades. 

One thing that blew my mind was its drying speed—it dried within hours, depending on the dilution and paper weight. It gave me ample time to work on my artwork without worrying about smudging my finished work. 

The versatility of this gouache is incredible. It can be applied on paper, bristol, and cardboard, making it a perfect medium for both students and professionals, whether you're working on models, studies, decors, or illustrations. 

Lastly, I appreciated that this gouache is lightfast, meaning it doesn't get chalky when it dries, preserving the vibrancy and intensity of the color. 

The only downside I noticed is its opacity—it wasn't entirely opaque compared to some other gouaches I've used in the past. But hey, you can always dilute it with water to achieve the desired opacity. 

All in all, the Pebeo Studio Gouache in Permanent White is a fantastic option for anyone looking for a high-quality, versatile gouache at an affordable price.

### [Talens Gouache 8-Color Extra Fine Mixing Set](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Gouache+Paint?utm\_term=talens-gouache-8-color-extra-fine-mixing-set)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Gouache+Paint?utm_term=talens-gouache-8-color-extra-fine-mixing-set"><img alt="talens-gouache-extra-fine-mixing-set-8-color-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/talens-gouache-extra-fine-mixing-set-8-color-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently gave the Talens Gouache Extra Fine Mixing Set a try, and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and performance of this product. I've had my fair share of gouaches in the past, and I must admit, this one took me by surprise. 

Firstly, the opacity of this gouache is impressive. It's clear the pigments used here are top-notch. The paint is easy to work with and dries in a matter of minutes, which is great for someone like me who loves to work quickly. I found the paint to be quite versatile too. It adheres well to any grease-free and porous surface, making it perfect for use on paper, board, wood, plaster, and even earthenware. 

One of the most standout features of this gouache set is its weatherproof nature. It's a definite plus when you're working outdoors or in a less-than-ideal work environment – no more worrying about rain ruining your artwork! But perhaps the cherry on top has to be the carrying strap. This feature makes it super convenient for artists who are always on the move, enabling a seamless transition from studio to outdoor settings. 

However, I did find a small downside, which is the consistency. While the gouache does have a nice, buttery texture when fresh from the tube, it tends to become a little sticky and harder to spread when it starts to dry out. But, this isn't a deal-breaker for me, as the pros certainly outweigh the cons. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the Talens Gouache Extra Fine Mixing Set to anyone looking for a high-quality, versatile, and weatherproof gouache. The set is reasonably priced, and the colors are both rich and opaque, making it the perfect companion for any artist's toolkit.

## Buyer's Guide

In this buyer's guide, we will discuss the important features to consider when purchasing gouache paint, as well as some general advice for using this product. 


### Understanding Gouache Paint

Gouache paint is a water-based medium that belongs to the same family as acrylic and watercolor paints. It consists of pigments suspended in a water-based binder. The paint dries quickly and forms a layer that is opaque and resistant to scratches. Gouache is known for its intense colors and is widely used for illustrations, graphic design, and fine art.

### Important Features of Gouache Paint

1. Opacity: Gouache paint is highly opaque, making it suitable for creating bold and vibrant colors on various surfaces. When choosing gouache paint, ensure that it has good opacity, as this will help you achieve the desired visual effect on your artwork or illustration. 2. Drying Time: Gouache paint dries faster than watercolor but slower than acrylic. Make sure you choose a paint that has a suitable drying time for your needs. 3. Color Selection: Gouache paint usually offers a wide range of colors, including primary and secondary colors, metallics, and pastels. Consider the color selection when buying, as this will impact the versatility of your paint. 4. Binder: The binder in gouache paint determines its properties, such as drying time, opacity, and washability. A good, high-quality binder will ensure that your gouache paint performs properly and gives you a smooth, even finish. 


### General Advice for Using Gouache Paint

1. Mix Colors: Gouache paint can be mixed with other colors to create new shades. To do this, place a small amount of each color onto a palette and mix them together using a brush or palette knife. 2. Experiment with Layers: Gouache paint can be used in layers to create depth and texture in your artwork. Start with a light color and gradually build up the layers, adding more opaque colors on top. 3. Cleaning Up: Gouache paint can be easily cleaned up with water. Make sure to clean your brushes and tools as soon as you finish working, as the paint can dry quickly and become difficult to remove.

Refrigerate: If you're not using the paint for a while, consider refrigerating it to keep the binder from settling. 3. Label: Label your gouache paint tubes with the name and color of each paint. This will help you quickly identify the paint when you're ready to use it.

### How do I clean my Gouache Paintbrushes?

Cleaning your Gouache Paintbrushes is an important task for any artist to maintain their tools' functionality. Ideally, you should clean your brushes shortly after use to prevent the paint from drying and hardening in the bristles. Gouache is water-soluble so it should be relatively easy to clean when fresh. 

The cleaning process involves running the bristles under warm water, gently agitating and rinsing until the color runs clear. Afterwards, you may clean your brush using a mild dish soap or brush cleaner to remove any remaining residue or paint. Once you've cleaned the brush, make sure to shape it into a point and let it air dry flat to maintain its integrity. 


### What are some tips for using Gouache Paint?

When using Gouache Paint, there are a few things to remember which will help you achieve the best results: first, because of its quick-drying nature, you need to work fast during the application process. To control the drying process, you should add more water to the paint or use a damp brush if you need to extend your working time. 

Secondly, Gouache Paint is highly pigmented so you need to use less paint to get the desired level of color. Thirdly, since Gouache is opaque, you can layer it on top of itself for more vivid and rich colors. Lastly, use a high-quality brush as Gouache requires precise control and detail to create the desired effects. These tips will help you make the most out of your Gouache Paint and create stunning artwork.
