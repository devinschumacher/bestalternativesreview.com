### [Agency Power AP-BRP-X3-110 Can-Am Maverick X3 Turbo Cold Air Intake Kit](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Maverick+X3+Turbo?utm\_term=agency-power-ap-brp-x3-110-can-am-maverick-x3-turbo-cold-air-intake-kit)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Maverick+X3+Turbo?utm_term=agency-power-ap-brp-x3-110-can-am-maverick-x3-turbo-cold-air-intake-kit"><img alt="agency-power-ap-brp-x3-110-17-19-can-am-maverick-x3-turbo-cold-air-intake-kit-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/agency-power-ap-brp-x3-110-17-19-can-am-maverick-x3-turbo-cold-air-intake-kit-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the opportunity to try out the Agency Power cold air intake kit for my Can-Am Maverick X3 Turbo. It was a smooth installation process and the product looked really sleek with its black powder coat finish. The high flow, reusable air filter was an impressive feature that made cleaning and maintaining the system much easier. However, during my first few rides, I noticed a decrease in performance, which I later found out was due to the clogged filter. 

Despite this initial setback, the intake kit proved its durability and longevity as it held up well even in dusty conditions. The precision cut aluminum plate with the Frogzskin material really stood out, as it effectively kept my engine and clutch free from clogging particles. The aluminum tube with fittings was a nice touch as it directly connected to the turbochargers compressor side, making the whole setup more efficient. 

One con I encountered was that the reducer for the turbo was slightly too big, making it difficult to fit at first. Additionally, the kit didn't come with instructions, which could have been helpful for first-time installers. 

Overall, although there were a few hitches, I'm happy with my Agency Power cold air intake kit. It proved to be a reliable and effective addition to my Maverick X3 Turbo, especially on the street. I would recommend it for a smooth and stylish upgrade to your vehicle, just make sure to clean the filter regularly for optimal performance.

I recently tried the K&N Can-Am Maverick X3 Turbo 900 Aircharger Performance Intake, and I have to say, it exceeded my expectations. The first thing that caught my attention was the air filter, which is designed to dramatically reduce intake restriction and provide a smoother, cleaner air flow to the engine. 

I was also impressed with the enclosed filter housing that protects the high-flow air filter from the elements. The custom-molded intake tube guides air directly into the engine's throttle body, ensuring optimal performance. 

The oversized cone-shaped air filter was a game-changer, as it turned out to be washable and reusable, saving me both time and money in the long run. I must admit that the installation process was relatively straightforward, taking me no more than 90 minutes to complete. The tools required were easy to come by and straightforward to use. 

However, it's crucial to note that this product cannot be sold or used in California due to its emission standards.
