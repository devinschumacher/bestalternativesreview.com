### [Keen Braddock Waterproof Low Shoes - Soft Toe](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Keen+Shoes?utm\_term=keen-braddock-waterproof-low-shoes-soft-toe)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Keen+Shoes?utm_term=keen-braddock-waterproof-low-shoes-soft-toe"><img alt="keen-mens-braddock-low-shoes-soft-toe-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/keen-mens-braddock-low-shoes-soft-toe-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

These Keen Braddock Low Shoes have become my go-to for all kinds of terrain.

The non-slip testing standards and oil and slip-resistant rubber outsole make these shoes perfect for work or outdoor adventures. 

However, one drawback is that they are not compatible with aftermarket insoles or orthotics. Additionally, the size and fit might be a bit snug for some, which could cause discomfort during long periods of wear. Overall, these shoes offer a great balance of comfort, durability, and performance, making them a reliable choice for any busy lifestyle.

### [Lightweight Work Shoe with Carbon Fiber Toe](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Keen+Shoes?utm\_term=lightweight-work-shoe-with-carbon-fiber-toe)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Keen+Shoes?utm_term=lightweight-work-shoe-with-carbon-fiber-toe"><img alt="mens-keen-kenton-mid-carbon-fiber-toe-work-shoes-11-5-brindle-gum-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mens-keen-kenton-mid-carbon-fiber-toe-work-shoes-11-5-brindle-gum-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try out these retro-inspired Men's Keen Kenton Mid Carbon Fiber Toe Work Shoes in the Brindle/Gum color. I was initially drawn to their lightweight safety features and energizing comfort. These shoes truly lived up to the hype – they were incredibly comfortable and supportive, making them perfect for my demanding work tasks. 

One of my favorite features was the active fit – while I appreciated the snug and secure feel of these shoes, I didn't have to worry about them being too tight or constricting. And thanks to their energy-returning comfort, I found myself easily handling longer shifts without any discomfort. 

However, as much as I loved the work shoes, there were a couple of downsides to them. The first was the lack of a waterproof option, which proved to be a problem on those days when I had to work in wet conditions. The second was the durability issue – while they were lightweight, they didn't seem to withstand the wear and tear of a busy workday as well as I'd hoped. 

Overall, the Men's Keen Kenton Mid Carbon Fiber Toe Work Shoes in Brindle/Gum are a great choice for those seeking a comfortable, supportive, and mid-height alternative for their workdays. With a few minor downsides, I believe the pros definitely outweigh the cons. 


### [Keen Men's Atlanta II Cooler+ Work Sandal with Asymmetrical Steel Toe and Removable Insoles](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Keen+Shoes?utm\_term=keen-mens-atlanta-ii-cooler-work-sandal-with-asymmetrical-steel-toe-and-removable-insoles)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Keen+Shoes?utm_term=keen-mens-atlanta-ii-cooler-work-sandal-with-asymmetrical-steel-toe-and-removable-insoles"><img alt="keen-mens-atlanta-ii-cooler-steel-toe-sandal-cascade-brown-black-10-w-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/keen-mens-atlanta-ii-cooler-steel-toe-sandal-cascade-brown-black-10-w-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I had the chance to test out Keen's Atlanta II Cooler+ work sandals, and let me tell you, they were a game-changer for my daily routine. The combination of comfort and protection was outstanding. The rubber sole allowed me to effortlessly walk on various surfaces without any discomfort, while the KEEN. PROTECT toe bumper provided the necessary protection against heavy objects. 

The sandals have a 12-inch boot opening, which made it easy for me to slip them on and off, and the shaft measuring approximately 2.5 inches from arch provided a snug fit. However, the asymmetrical steel safety toes might be a bit of a concern for some users who require a more natural and comfortable toe box. 

Overall, the Atlanta II Cooler+ work sandals offer an excellent balance of comfort, protection, and style. Don't hesitate to give them a try for your daily work or outdoor activities; you won't be disappointed! 


### [Keen Men's Vista Energy Shift Carbon Fiber Slip-on Safety Shoes with Breathable Mesh Upper & Energy Return Midsole](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Keen+Shoes?utm\_term=keen-mens-vista-energy-shift-carbon-fiber-slip-on-safety-shoes-with-breathable-mesh-upper-energy-return-midsole)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Keen+Shoes?utm_term=keen-mens-vista-energy-shift-carbon-fiber-slip-on-safety-shoes-with-breathable-mesh-upper-energy-return-midsole"><img alt="keen-mens-vista-energy-shift-black-carbon-fiber-toe-shoes-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/keen-mens-vista-energy-shift-black-carbon-fiber-toe-shoes-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried the Keen Men's Vista Energy Shift, and I have to say, it was a real game-changer for my workdays. Unlike most safety shoes, this one doesn't feel like it's weighing you down. The carbon-fiber toe provided excellent protection while still being comfortable enough to wear all day. 

One of the standout features for me was the moisture-wicking textile lining. After long hours on my feet, my socks would usually feel soggy and uncomfortable. But with the Vista Energy Shift, my feet stayed dry and fresh throughout the day. 

Another thing I appreciated was the non-metallic construction and non-mutilating upper. It made the shoe feel more flexible and comfortable, which was a nice change from the rigid safety shoes I'm used to. 

However, there were a couple of things I didn't enjoy as much. The slip-on silhouette was a bit tricky to get used to, and I found myself having to readjust the shoe a few times during the day to make sure it was securely in place. 

Lastly, the Electro Static Dissipative (ESD) or Super-Static Dissipative (SD+) footwear construction was a bit odd at first. It felt like the shoe was constantly charging, which I thought was a bit strange, but it didn't seem to have any negative effects on my work. 

Overall, the Keen Men's Vista Energy Shift was a great daily wear option for me. It provided excellent protection and comfort, and I'll definitely be considering it for future purchases.

I recently tried on the Keen Men's Jasper Mid WP and was pleasantly surprised. As I put them on, I noticed a familiar comfort of Keen footwear. The low-profile rubber outsole heightened the ground feel, making it perfect for my outdoor adventures. The suede upper felt sturdy yet breathable, while the contoured fit provided a secure grip. However, I had a bit of a challenge with the laces – they seemed a tad too short. 

The Keen Jasper Mid Waterproof shoes have been an excellent addition to my wardrobe. They're perfect for work and casual wear, keeping my feet dry and comfortable. The waterproof feature was a bonus, especially during rainy days. The slick, all-black design matched a variety of outfits, making them a versatile hybrid between a boot and a sneaker. 

Overall, I'd highly recommend these shoes for anyone looking for a combination of style, comfort, and performance. The KEEN.

### [Keen Men's Targhee II Waterproof Hiking Boots](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Keen+Shoes?utm\_term=keen-mens-targhee-ii-waterproof-hiking-boots)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Keen+Shoes?utm_term=keen-mens-targhee-ii-waterproof-hiking-boots"><img alt="keen-mens-waterproof-hiking-boots-targhee-ii-mid-7-shitake-brindle-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/keen-mens-waterproof-hiking-boots-targhee-ii-mid-7-shitake-brindle-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Keen Men's Waterproof Hiking Boots over the past several months now, both for short hikes and multi-day backpacking trips. One of the things I appreciate the most is the lightweight nature of these boots; they feel like they're barely there when I'm walking long distances. And speaking of walking, the Keen boots have proven to be fantastic for providing support to both my ankles and my toes. These boots are well-known for their incredible sole structure, and indeed, they do deliver. 

In fact, the aggressive outsole is what keeps me from turning my ankles on uneven ground. The 4mm lugs provide tremendous traction, allowing me to walk confidently without worrying about slipping. Now, I've talked to other people who have used these boots before, and one thing we all agree on is the waterproofing. Not once, despite the occasional downpours, have my feet gotten wet. It’s great to be able to trek through the rain and cross shallow stream without worrying about my socks getting soaked. 

The shoe’s upper is made from a sort of high-tech mesh that lets water out but keeps it from getting in. It's quite breathable too, which is a nice change from those stifling rubber boots I used to wear. 

Now, that's not to say everything's perfect. Sometimes when it's really muddy, the outsoles do clog up a bit and might need a quick scrub afterwards, a bit of a hassle, really. But it's a small price to pay for the comfort, support, durability, and style that these boots offer overall. 

Overall, I've found Keen Men's Waterproof Hiking Boots to be a great investment. They've been with me through thick and thin during my adventures, from camping to hiking, and I've been more than satisfied with their performance. 


### [Stylish Waterproof Leather Keen Austin Shoes for Men](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Keen+Shoes?utm\_term=stylish-waterproof-leather-keen-austin-shoes-for-men)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Keen+Shoes?utm_term=stylish-waterproof-leather-keen-austin-shoes-for-men"><img alt="keen-mens-austin-shoes-black-18" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/keen-mens-austin-shoes-black-18/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Over the past few months, I've been testing out the Keen Men's Austin Shoes in black. These sneakers quickly became my go-to for casual outings and leisure activities. The robust leather upper is not only stylish but also waterproof, protecting my feet from the elements. The inside is made of moisture-wicking synthetic material, keeping my feet dry and comfortable. 

One of my favorite features is the removable insole. While I didn't need to, I appreciated the ability to personalize the shoe to fit my feet perfectly. The cushioning midsole provides a high level of comfort, even during long walks. The wide toe box offers a natural space for my toes to spread, a feature that's characteristic of Keen shoes. 

However, there were a couple of things that could have been better. The first pair of shoes I received had a less durable sole compared to the previous version. Additionally, the laces initially proved to be shorter than needed, but that issue was easily resolved with some paracord. 

While using these shoes, I found that they could handle both casual activities and harsher environments with ease. They were even suitable for occasional trail runs without any issues. Overall, the Austin shoes from Keen are more than just a casual shoe – they're a versatile, high-quality pair that enhances my daily activities.

One of the highlights of these shoes, in my opinion, was the TPU reinforcement for durability in key areas. After countless miles of wear, they still looked and felt as sturdy as the day I first put them on. The KEEN. Dry membranes and PFAS-free durable water-repellent treatments were a bonus for those rainy hiking days. 

That said, I did encounter a minor issue with the outsole – it became quite slippery when the ground was damp. However, this didn't deter me from enjoying the outdoors, and I was able to adapt by being mindful of my footing. 

Overall, the Keen Men's NXIS Explorer Mid Waterproof Shoes exceeded my expectations in terms of comfort and durability. If you're looking for a reliable pair of all-terrain hiking boots, these might just be the ones for you.

### Should I choose a Keen Shoe with a waterproof membrane or one without?

Keen Shoes with waterproof membranes are a great choice if you often hike in wet or humid environments, as they keep your feet dry and comfortable. The main difference between waterproof and non-waterproof Keen shoes lies in their construction. Waterproof shoes have a hydrophobic membrane that prevents water from entering while allowing water vapor to escape. This helps regulate your foot's temperature and moisture, reducing the risk of blisters and fungal infections. 

Non-waterproof Keen shoes, while not as impervious to water, still provide decent protection against moisture and mud. They might be a more breathable and comfortable choice if you prefer to hike in dry climates. Additionally, non-waterproof shoes tend to be slightly less expensive than their waterproof counterparts.
