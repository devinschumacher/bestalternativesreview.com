### [Vans Saffron Era 59 'C&L Shoe - Orange Vans Design](https://serp.ly/amazon/Orange+Vans?utm\_term=vans-saffron-era-59-cl-shoe-orange-vans-design)

As a fan of Vans, I decided to give the C&L Era 59 a try - specifically in the Saffron color. To my delight, this sleek and slimmed-down version felt incredibly comfortable upon first wear. The durable and sturdy canvas uppers, paired with the leather accents, offer great support and flexibility while keeping me stylish on the go. 

The secret ingredient? The gum rubber outsole with the signature waffle tread, providing an exceptional grip and boardfeel. Whether I'm running errands or hitting the local skatepark, this versatile pair always feels right. A word of caution, though—the colors may fade (as seen in the image) after a few wears, so it's best to treat them like your favorite t-shirt. All in all, the Vans C&L Era 59 is a reliable and stylish choice for any Vans enthusiast.

### [Vans VR3 Authentic Sneakers in Orange Size 12](https://serp.ly/amazon/Orange+Vans?utm\_term=vans-vr3-authentic-sneakers-in-orange-size-12)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Orange+Vans?utm_term=vans-vr3-authentic-sneakers-in-orange-size-12"><img alt="vans-authentic-vr3-sneakers-orange-size-12-east-dane-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vans-authentic-vr3-sneakers-orange-size-12-east-dane-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently gave the Vans Authentic VR3 Sneakers in Orange a try, and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed. The sturdy canvas upper provides a solid foundation for the shoe, while the soft footbed ensures all-day comfort. The vibrant orange color adds a pop of style to my everyday outfits, and the size 12 fits perfectly. 

Overall, I'm really happy with this purchase and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others in search of a reliable and stylish sneaker. 


### [Orange Tiger Vans Men's Old Skool Sneakers - Size 5.5](https://serp.ly/amazon/Orange+Vans?utm\_term=orange-tiger-vans-mens-old-skool-sneakers-size-5-5)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Orange+Vans?utm_term=orange-tiger-vans-mens-old-skool-sneakers-size-5-5"><img alt="vans-old-skool-orange-tiger-mens-size-5-6" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vans-old-skool-orange-tiger-mens-size-5-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I'm not typically one to go for classic styling, but these Vans Old Skool sneakers have really won me over. With their vibrant orange and tiger color scheme, I feel like I'm making a statement every time I slip them on. The smooth suede and canvas upper give them a soft, plush feel that I didn't expect from a sneaker. It's like having a cozy blanket on my feet! 

The padded collars and reinforced toe cap provide a great level of support and durability that I've come to appreciate. And while the lace fastening might seem like a minor detail, it helps ensure a secure fit that keeps my feet from slipping around. The cushioned midsole provides a smooth ride, and the grippy rubber outsole gives me the confidence I need on any surface. 

One thing I will point out, though - while I'm generally happy with the quality of these sneakers, I've noticed that the insole isn't as powerful as I would have liked. Perhaps not a deal-breaker, but something to consider if you plan on doing lots of skating or other high-impact activities. 

All in all, the Vans Old Skool sneakers are a solid choice for anyone looking for a blend of classic style and modern functionality. And with the signature Sidestripe and Vans branding, you're sure to turn heads wherever you go. 


### [Vans Orange OG Authentic LX Canvas Sneakers with Checkerboard Print](https://serp.ly/amazon/Orange+Vans?utm\_term=vans-orange-og-authentic-lx-canvas-sneakers-with-checkerboard-print)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Orange+Vans?utm_term=vans-orange-og-authentic-lx-canvas-sneakers-with-checkerboard-print"><img alt="sneakers-vans-vault-authentic-lx-og-orange-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sneakers-vans-vault-authentic-lx-og-orange-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on a pair of Vans Vault OG Authentic sneakers in a vibrant orange color. The moment I slipped them on, I was instantly drawn to their classic checkerboard print on the canvas upper. It's a design that's been around for ages, yet still feels fresh and hip. 

One of the features that stood out the most is the lace-up front. It provides a nice, snug fit that feels comfortable and secure all day long. The woven label on the side adds a touch of cool sophistication. 

Now, let's talk about the inside of these kicks. The Ortholite footbed really makes a difference by providing cushioning and support while walking or running errands around town. The rubber waffle outsole, as you'd expect from Vans, is durable and provides excellent traction. 

However, these shoes are not for everyone. Since all sizes are listed in U. S. Men's sizing, make sure to double-check your size before making a purchase. If you're anything like me, who always forgets that they're not U. S. size, you might want to stick to your usual size as they fit perfectly without a need for adjustments. Overall, these orange Vans sneakers are a comfortable and stylish option that'll brighten up any outfit.

The double-stitch vamp adds durability, which I love because I put these shoes through some serious wear and tear during my skate sessions. The gum rubber outsole with a vulcanized sole attachment ensures a solid grip on the board, which is essential for those tricky maneuvers. 

Now, the Vans Era isn't perfect. The size was a bit of a challenge to find, but once I had a pair that fit perfectly, I was golden.

The slimmed-down profile offered a comfy and flexible feel, while the gum rubber outsole delivered superior grip and boardfeel that was ideal for everyday wear. One aspect I particularly liked was the variety of sizes and colors available, making it easy to find the perfect fit and style for me. 

However, not everything was smooth sailing. I had a bit of an issue finding the right size, as one reviewer mentioned. I usually wear a 7.5, but these seemed to run slightly larger, so I had to order a smaller size to fit properly. Overall, though, I was quite satisfied with the product and would definitely recommend it to others. The Vans Authentic sneakers were a comfortable, stylish addition to my wardrobe, and their long-lasting quality made them a great investment.

### [Vans Checkerboard Classic Slip-On Shoes in Cadmium Orange/True White](https://serp.ly/amazon/Orange+Vans?utm\_term=vans-checkerboard-classic-slip-on-shoes-in-cadmium-orange-true-white)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Orange+Vans?utm_term=vans-checkerboard-classic-slip-on-shoes-in-cadmium-orange-true-white"><img alt="vans-checkerboard-classic-slip-on-shoes-cadmium-orange-true-white-5-0-boys-6-5-women-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vans-checkerboard-classic-slip-on-shoes-cadmium-orange-true-white-5-0-boys-6-5-women-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I had my eye on the Vans Checkerboard Classic Slip-On shoes for a while, and when I finally got my hands on them, I was super excited! I decided to go with the Cadmium Orange/True White color, which I thought would make a bold yet stylish statement. 

The first thing I noticed when I put them on was the comfortable fit and cozy padding in the soles. These shoes felt like a warm embrace for my feet, which was perfect for my daily walks around the city. 

The iconic checkerboard print, combined with the low profile canvas uppers, really elevated the overall look of these slip-ons. I received tons of compliments on their unique design, making me feel like I had chosen the perfect statement footwear. 

However, things didn't go so smoothly with the elastic side accents. Although they were advertised as a feature, I found them to be quite inconvenient. They kept pulling the shoes onto my heel, causing an uncomfortable rubbing sensation that was hard to deal with. 

Another downside to these shoes was the lasting power of the rubber waffle outsoles. I noticed the soles started to wear down quite quickly, and within a few months, I had to replace them. It was a disappointment, as I had been looking forward to enjoying these shoes for much longer. 

Overall, the Vans Checkerboard Classic Slip-On shoes had their pros and cons. The low profile canvas uppers, supportive padded collars, and funky checkerboard print made them a unique addition to my wardrobe. But the elastic side accents and quick-wearing outsoles were issues that I couldn't overlook.

The vulcanized sole construction and grippy outsole with a waffle profile provide excellent traction and support. The Vans side label and heel tag add a sleek touch to these shoes, making them a must-have for any Vans fan. 

While I love the overall design and comfort of these shoes, I do wish the sizing was a bit more accurate.
