## Buyer's Guide

Makerbot 3D printers have gained immense popularity among hobbyists and professionals alike due to their ease of use and versatility. Before making a purchase, it's essential to consider different factors, such as the build volume, print quality, software compatibility, and cost. This buyer's guide will help you understand the most important aspects to consider before investing in a Makerbot 3D printer. 


### Build Volume

Build volume is an essential factor to consider while choosing a Makerbot 3D printer. The build volume refers to the maximum size of the object that can be printed on the machine. Generally, 3D printers come with two types of build volumes - cubic and rectangular. Cubic build volume allows the printer to print objects from different angles, while rectangular build volume limits the printing directions to only two or more. If you frequently print large objects, ensure the Makerbot 3D printer you choose has an appropriate build volume.

### Print Quality

The print quality is another critical factor that affects the overall performance of a Makerbot 3D printer. It determines the accuracy, resolution, and finish of the printed object. For optimal print quality, look for 3D printers with high-resolution print heads and smooth layer adhesion. Moreover, the printer's cooling system plays a vital role in maintaining high-quality prints. 


### Software Compatibility

Makerbot 3D printers are compatible with various software programs, including Thingiverse and their own Makerbot Print Shop. Thingiverse is an online repository of 3D printable objects, while the Print Shop offers a curated list of models. However, it's always good to check if the software you're planning to use is compatible with the Makerbot 3D printer you want to buy. This will make the printing process more streamlined and efficient.
