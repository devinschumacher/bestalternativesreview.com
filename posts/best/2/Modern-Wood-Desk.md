### [Macari Otis Mango Wood Modern Desk - Medium Size](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Modern+Wood+Desk?utm\_term=macari-otis-mango-wood-modern-desk-medium-size)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Modern+Wood+Desk?utm_term=macari-otis-mango-wood-modern-desk-medium-size"><img alt="macari-otis-mango-wood-modern-desk-brown-matte-size-medium-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/macari-otis-mango-wood-modern-desk-brown-matte-size-medium-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Mod-Arte Pratt Natural Wood Modern Office Desk](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Modern+Wood+Desk?utm\_term=mod-arte-pratt-natural-wood-modern-office-desk)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Modern+Wood+Desk?utm_term=mod-arte-pratt-natural-wood-modern-office-desk"><img alt="mod-arte-pratt-modern-kiln-dried-hard-wood-office-desk-in-natural-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mod-arte-pratt-modern-kiln-dried-hard-wood-office-desk-in-natural-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Mod-Arte Pratt Modern Kiln-Dried Hard Wood Office Desk in Natural and I have to say, it's a beautiful addition to any home office. The desk is made of solid hardwood and available in multiple colors, but I chose the natural finish to bring a bit of nature into my workspace. 

One of the things that stood out to me was the attention to detail in the construction. Each piece was hand-sanded and hand-finished, giving the desk a unique touch that I truly appreciate. The angled wood legs add a mid-century modern aesthetic, making the desk a striking piece of furniture. 

However, there were a few minor issues I encountered during the setup process. The drawers are made of particle board instead of solid wood, which was disappointing since I had purchased the desk for its solid wood construction. Additionally, one of the holes for attaching the screws and washers did not seal properly, but with some Duco Cement glue, I was able to secure it. 

Overall, I would recommend this desk for its minimalist style and high-quality wood. It's a beautiful addition to any workspace and the natural finish adds a touch of nature to your daily grind. Just be prepared to do some minor assembly and keep an eye out for the particle board drawers.

I recently purchased the 82" Harrison Desk for my home office, and I must say, it's a stunning addition. The black American oak wood veneer with an open grain finish gives it a sophisticated and powerful look.

One of my favorite features is the chrome wire management ports, as they allow me to keep my workspace organized and clutter-free. The painted silver desktop support accents also give the desk a sturdy and well-crafted feel.
