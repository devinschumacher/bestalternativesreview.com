This powerful 4-in-1 formula works wonders on all pool types, including above-ground, inflatable, and inground pools. It even won't fade your pool liner, which is a major plus. 

While the strong shock can be a little overpowering at first, it's nothing compared to the results you'll see. After a few uses, the smell dissipates, and your pool water will be sparkling clean and fresh. The product is also cost-effective, making it a budget-friendly choice for any pool owner. 

Overall, I highly recommend HTH Pool Care Shock Advanced for anyone looking to keep their pool crystal clear and healthy all season long. It's easy to use, powerful, and won't break the bank.

### What is Hth Pool Shock?

Hth Pool Shock is a popular brand of pool shock, which is a type of granular chlorine used to sanitize and maintain the water quality of swimming pools. It helps to kill bacteria, algae, and other contaminants, keeping the pool clean and safe for swimmers. Hth Pool Shock is available in various sizes and strengths, making it suitable for different types of pools and water conditions.

### How does Hth Pool Shock work?

Hth Pool Shock works by releasing chlorine into the pool water, which then reacts with the contaminants present in the water, such as bacteria, algae, and other organic matter. The chlorine forms hypochlorous acid, a powerful oxidizing agent that destroys the cell walls of bacteria and other microorganisms, effectively killing them. The hypochlorous acid also neutralizes the odors and stains caused by these contaminants. 

The pool shock also helps to maintain the water’s pH balance, ensuring that the water is neither too acidic nor too alkaline. This is important because the pH level of the pool water affects how well the chlorine works in sanitizing the water. Hth Pool Shock is designed to work effectively in pools with a pH level between 7.2 and 7.8, making it a versatile and reliable choice for pool owners.
