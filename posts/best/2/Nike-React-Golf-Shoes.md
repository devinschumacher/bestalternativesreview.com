The ability of the spikes to compress with pressure contributed to my stability, as well as to my overall comfort. All in all, the Nike React Infinity Pro Golf Shoes proved to be an ideal choice for golfers seeking a balance of comfort, support, and traction.

Despite these shoes offering an overall satisfying experience, they did come with a couple of drawbacks. Initially, I observed a slightly narrower fit compared to other Nike golf shoes, necessitating a larger size for a comfortable fit. Furthermore, the breathable textile appeared to wear down slightly after a few rounds, raising concerns over its longevity. Notwithstanding these minor concerns, I found the Nike React Infinity Pro Golf Shoes to be a reliable and trustworthy addition to my golfing arsenal.

The shoes' gusset on the tongue made it a breeze to slip them on and off, while also providing extra side-to-side support. And despite the occasional sizing issue, I found these shoes to be quite comfortable, even though I had to go up a size. 

There's only one downside that I've encountered – a slight air leak from the left side. It's not a deal-breaker, but it's something worth mentioning. 

Overall, the Nike Men's Air Zoom Infinity Tour Next% golf shoes have exceeded my expectations in terms of comfort, support, and performance. They're a stylish and practical addition to any golfer's wardrobe. Plus, they're a great value for the price, making them a worthy investment for anyone looking to improve their game.

I recently tried out the Nike Air Zoom Infinity Tour NEXT% Golf Shoes, and I must say, they've made a significant improvement over the previous model. The shoes feel more responsive and comfortable, thanks to the increased volume and updated forefoot cushioning. The traction in key areas is a game-changer, giving me more control during my swing and reducing the risk of slipping. 

The breathable textile used in the shoes works wonders, keeping my feet cool and dry even after hours on the course. The plush, padded collar does an excellent job of reducing heel slip while I move, allowing for a more comfortable experience overall. Dynamic response from the two Zoom Air units in the forefoot is a great feature, providing better energy return when I push off through my swing. 

However, I found that the shoes are slightly narrower than I expected, and they could use a bit more wiggle room for my wide feet. Additionally, the shoes seemed to have a bit of a stiff or heavy-duty feel to them, which might not be ideal for those looking for a lightweight option. Another minor drawback is the lack of water resistance, meaning wetter conditions might affect the shoes' performance. 

Despite these minor cons, I'm quite pleased with the Nike Air Zoom Infinity Tour NEXT% Golf Shoes. They provide excellent comfort, traction, and responsiveness, making them a great choice for golf enthusiasts looking to improve their game.
