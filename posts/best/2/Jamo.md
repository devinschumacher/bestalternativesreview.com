I recently purchased the Jamo S 810 Sub Powered Subwoofer to enhance my home theater experience. As someone who appreciates both style and performance, this subwoofer didn't disappoint. The 10-inch polyfiber woofer and 150W bottom-mounted class D amplifier create a powerful and dynamic bass that complements both my full cinema surround system and critical 2-channel listening. 

The new Jamo Studio 8 series is a modern update, with its clean, minimalist lines and contemporary material choices. The compact ultra-slim cabinet allows for exceptional placement flexibility in any urban living environment. I particularly enjoyed the 90-degree power cable, which allowed me to position the subwoofer for minimal intrusion into the room. 

One aspect I found challenging was the controls being mounted on the bottom of the subwoofer, facing the floor. However, once calibrated and on auto, there's no need for further adjustments. Overall, the Jamo S 810 Sub Powered Subwoofer exceeded my expectations, delivering both style and performance while maintaining a reasonable price point.
