### [Himalayan Dog Yaky Peanut Butter Chew - High-Protein, Lactose-Free Treat](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Kong+Peanut+Butter?utm\_term=himalayan-dog-yaky-peanut-butter-chew-high-protein-lactose-free-treat)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Kong+Peanut+Butter?utm_term=himalayan-dog-yaky-peanut-butter-chew-high-protein-lactose-free-treat"><img alt="himalayan-dog-yaky-churro-peanut-butter-4-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/himalayan-dog-yaky-churro-peanut-butter-4-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer, I have tried the Himalayan Dog Churro Peanut Butter Chews, and I must say, it was the perfect snack for my furry friends. The chew's unique shape and peanut butter flavor were a hit with our canine crew, and it served as a quick way to break up the monotony of everyday snacks. 

One of the standout features of this product is its soft texture, which makes it suitable for puppies of all ages and even senior dogs. As a bonus, it's lactose-free, ensuring that all members of our doggy family can enjoy it without any issues. While the consistency makes them easier to chew, the downside is that they can be a bit messy, especially when my dog is getting excited over the peanut butter goodness. 

The high protein content is another positive aspect of these chews, which ensures that my dogs receive the necessary nutrients from their treats. However, I noticed that the churros can be quite dense and challenging for small dogs, like my puppy, to chew through. It's worth mentioning that these chews promote dental health, thanks to their unique ridged shape that cleans and massages gums while providing entertainment for our pets. 

Overall, I would recommend the Himalayan Dog Peanut Butter Churros for dogs of all sizes, although it's essential to supervise smaller dogs so that they don't accidentally swallow a large piece. The variety of flavors is also a bonus, as it allows owners to switch things up and see which one their dogs prefer the most. 


### [Nutri Chomps Peanut Butter Flavor Dog Treats for Kong](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Kong+Peanut+Butter?utm\_term=nutri-chomps-peanut-butter-flavor-dog-treats-for-kong)

I recently tried the Peanut Butter Flavor Nutri Chomps, a rawhide-free dog treat that's become a staple in my house.

Measuring 6.5 inches in height and 5 inches in width, these treats are a suitable size for various dog sizes, even for smaller ones who just need a smaller bite. 

When I first introduced them to my furry friends, they eagerly embraced the treats and started chewing away. I appreciated the fact that they were easily digestible, as some treats on the market can cause stomach problems for dogs. And I was thrilled to see that these Nutri Chomps promote good dental health, ensuring fresh breath and a healthy mouth for my dogs. 

However, there was a bit of a surprise. The Peanut Butter Flavor Nutri Chomps were so popular among my dogs that they managed to devour them within minutes. I found myself wishing that they lasted a bit longer so that the treats could be enjoyed for a bit longer. I also noticed that the braids tend to come apart after just a few chews, which could present a potential choking hazard for my dogs. 

Overall, the Peanut Butter Flavor Nutri Chomps have become a new favorite in my dog-centric home. They're a rawhide-free, high-protein alternative that packs a powerful flavor punch, making them a hit with even the most finicky eaters.

### [Pet Naturals Busy Butter Calming Peanut Butter for Kong](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Kong+Peanut+Butter?utm\_term=pet-naturals-busy-butter-calming-peanut-butter-for-kong)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Kong+Peanut+Butter?utm_term=pet-naturals-busy-butter-calming-peanut-butter-for-kong"><img alt="pet-naturals-busy-butter-calming-peanut-butter-1-5oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/pet-naturals-busy-butter-calming-peanut-butter-1-5oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using Pet Naturals Busy Butter Calming Peanut Butter for my furry friend, a nervous little pup who hates storms and gets easily stressed. And let me tell you, this product has truly been a game-changer! The natural ingredients, like L-theanine, lemon balm, and organic peanut butter, work wonders in calming my anxious dog and turning those fearful moments into a peaceful atmosphere for both of us. 

What stood out the most is the unique pouch design, which makes it super easy to squeeze the butter onto a fillable toy or simply let my dog lick it straight from the pouch. The convenient packaging also comes with six individual pouches, making it perfect for those unexpected storms or when we're on the go. 

The ingredient quality of this peanut butter is top-notch, made from organic peanuts and palm oil, which means I don't have to worry about any artificial additives. And the smell? It's so delightful that I could almost eat it myself! 

However, there are a few things I wish were improved. Firstly, the packaging can be a bit messy and wasteful, as the thick peanut butter tends to get stuck in the opening and some of it is inevitably wasted. [Secondly, the calming effect might not be as noticeable for some dogs, like my cat, who wasn't interested in this treat at all.](https://gist.github.com/janeknowsbest77/4fd1dc865a50d1d14d6fc54e9ca24d72) 

Overall, I'm happy with my decision to try Pet Naturals Busy Butter Calming Peanut Butter. It's a valuable addition to my furry friend's stress-relief toolkit, and it's a delightful treat that she enjoys.

The moment I first held the Kong Stuff'N all-natural peanut butter pouch, I could sense a convenient mess-free solution for my furry friend's toy-filling needs. I appreciated the thoughtful design and the natural, delicious peanut butter flavor. But my joy was cut short when I found the product to be quite runny, making it quite challenging to actually stuff it into a Kong toy. 

I had to be extra cautious to avoid a mess on the floor, as I only managed to squeeze it out in small bursts. Thankfully, my furry friend seemed to enjoy both the taste and the challenge. The price point was reasonable but I found the packaging somewhat wasteful. 

Overall, it's a good product with some minor design flaws, but it certainly helped in keeping my dog engaged and entertained.
