### [15-Foot x 20-Foot Blue Poly Tarp - Ultimate Heavy Duty Protection](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Heavy+Duty+Tarp?utm\_term=15-foot-x-20-foot-blue-poly-tarp-ultimate-heavy-duty-protection)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Heavy+Duty+Tarp?utm_term=15-foot-x-20-foot-blue-poly-tarp-ultimate-heavy-duty-protection"><img alt="kotap-15-ft-x-20-ft-general-purpose-blue-poly-tarp-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/kotap-15-ft-x-20-ft-general-purpose-blue-poly-tarp-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a seasoned camper, I've been using a variety of tarps to protect my precious gear from the elements, and this Kotap 15-ft x 20-ft general-purpose blue poly tarp has definitely caught my attention. 

Firstly, the woven and coated polyethylene used in this tarp adds to its durability and strength, making it an excellent choice for covering camping sites or acting as an emergency construction cover. The 10 x 8 weave per square inch provides an impressive surface area, ensuring that no nooks or crannies are left exposed. 

One of the features that impressed me the most is its sun and fade resistance. I've been caught in a few severe sunburns during my outdoor adventures, but this tarp has definitely shielded my gear and prevented any unexpected damage. The heat-sealed and polyethylene-rope reinforced edges further reinforced its reliability, providing a sturdy and long-lasting cover. 

However, there are a few drawbacks to consider. While the rust-proof aluminum grommets offer strength and provide extra security, they also add weight to the tarp. This might not be a major concern for an occasional camper, but it's worth noting. Additionally, the relatively high price tag may deter budget-conscious campers from purchasing it. 

Despite these minor shortcomings, the Kotap 15-ft x 20-ft general-purpose blue poly tarp has proven to be a reliable and sturdy outdoor companion. Its high-density polyethylene weave provides a robust and durable covering for camping gear and construction materials. While the price might be a deterrent for some, the excellent strength and functionality of this tarp make it a worthwhile investment for camping enthusiasts seeking a reliable, durable, and long-lasting tarp.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Heavy+Duty+Tarp?utm_term=super-heavy-duty-16-mil-brown-poly-tarp-protective-and-uv-resistant"><img alt="4-x-20-super-heavy-duty-16-mil-brown-poly-tarp-cover-thick-waterproof-uv-resistant-rip-and-tear-proo-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/4-x-20-super-heavy-duty-16-mil-brown-poly-tarp-cover-thick-waterproof-uv-resistant-rip-and-tear-proo-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Recently, I came across a heavy-duty tarp that exceeded my expectations in terms of durability and versatility. This 16 mil Brown Poly Tarp Cover proved to be an excellent investment for various scenarios, from covering outdoor furniture during winter to shielding wood stacks from the rain. 

The quality of this tarp is truly remarkable; it boasts a thickness of 16 mil and an 8oz per square yard density, coupled with a 16 x 16 weave count. The metal grommets, spaced every 18 inches or 1.5 feet, make it incredibly easy to tie down and secure the tarp to various surfaces. 

I've had the opportunity to use this heavy-duty tarp for multiple applications, ranging from protecting my car during renovations to creating a drop sheet for painting and polishing. Its versatility is undeniably impressive, and the tarp has proven to be both waterproof and UV resistant, ensuring that it withstands various harsh weather conditions. 

One of the standout features of this tarp is its reinforced grommets, which are strategically placed at each corner. This design allows for sturdy tie-downs, making it suitable for securing the tarp over various objects. The 4' x 20' size is also a significant advantage, providing ample coverage area for different applications without compromising on thickness and sturdiness. 

However, there's one area where this tarp could benefit from some improvement. The metal grommets seem to be a potential weak point, as one user reported damages to their grommets upon receiving the product. As a result, I would recommend that the manufacturing and packaging processes focus on addressing this issue to ensure maximum product satisfaction. 

In conclusion, this 16 mil Brown Poly Tarp Cover has been an incredibly reliable and versatile addition to my toolkit. Its exceptional quality, durability, and waterproof features have made it worth the investment, even if it may need some improvements in its component parts.

However, be aware, this is not a suitable option for painting purposes as the color may not be consistent throughout, and the fabric may shrink.

Overall, it's a solid investment for those needing a reliable and sturdy protective cover.

I spent a weekend camping in the woods with a group of friends, and we had the perfect shelter thanks to this heavy-duty canvas tarp. The Tan color complemented nature's surroundings beautifully, and the 21 mil thickness made it sturdy enough to withstand unexpected gusts of wind. The most impressive feature, however, was its water resistance. We encountered a sudden downpour during our trip, and the tarp's breathability was a lifesaver as we waited it out under the sturdy cover. 

The pre-Owned, heavy-duty tarp, designed by Mytee Products, boasts double stitched grommets spaced evenly on the canvas. We used it as a makeshift roof, keeping our camping gear and equipment protected from the elements. Despite some slight size discrepancies, we were impressed with the overall build quality and ease of use. 

However, some minor concerns did come to light. The tarp's weight, while providing stability, sometimes made it a bit challenging to move and adjust. But that was a small price to pay when we considered how well it performed as a reliable shelter during our outdoor excursion. 

Overall, this canvas tarp proved to be a great investment for our camping adventure. Its sturdiness, water resistance, and breathability are standout features that make it perfect for a variety of outdoor uses.

It was an unpredictable weather day – cool in the morning, then it turned bright and sunny in the afternoon. With a storm on the horizon, I knew we could use a sturdy tarp to make the most of the spot. The Bass Pro Shops Heavy-Duty Tarp I'd bought a few weeks ago came in handy. 

Setting up camp with my kids, the tarp was surprisingly light and easy to unfold. We had it stretched across four trees, and its length of 16 feet allowed us to cover our little fishing gear and backpacking gear. The durable grommets helped keep everything secure and in place, even during the gusty winds. 

I'm quite surprised by how well this tarp held up against the wet ground, and still, it hasn't showed any signs of wear and tear.

I recently purchased a heavy-duty tarp from Everbilt to cover my outdoor furniture during the harsh winter months. This brown and silver tarp seemed like the perfect accessory to keep my patio in good condition. 

One of the main features that caught my attention was its durability, specifically the 10-mil fabric thickness. Its 14 grommets were certainly convenient for securing the tarp, and the reversible tarp color was a nice touch for UV sun deflection. The tarp's mildew and rot resistance were significant factors in my decision to buy it. 

Unfortunately, I encountered some issues with the product. After just a few weeks of use, I noticed the tarp began to disintegrate and lose color. Not only did it fail to hold up against the harsh weather conditions, but the grommets proved to be weaker than the material. This left me disappointed, as I had hoped for a sturdier and more resistant tarp. 

In conclusion, while the Everbilt heavy-duty tarp had some appealing features, its overall durability and resistance to harsh weather conditions left much to be desired. I would recommend looking for an alternative product with better quality and performance. 


## Buyer's Guide

Protecting your valuable assets from the harsh weather elements is crucial, and that's where heavy-duty tarps come in. These sturdy, versatile, and durable covers help safeguard your belongings during transportation, storage, or outdoor activities. In this buyer's guide, we will discuss the essential features to consider when purchasing a heavy-duty tarp, the applications they are best suited for, and tips for maintenance and longevity. 


### Material

Heavy-duty tarps are typically made from strong, durable materials that can withstand harsh conditions. The most common materials include polyethylene, polypropylene, and vinyl. Polyethylene is the most popular choice due to its durability, water resistance, and affordability. Polypropylene offers similar benefits but with increased resistance to UV damage and chemicals.

Larger tarps may be more suitable for covering vehicles or outdoor equipment, while smaller tarps may be more convenient for smaller items or portable storage. Additionally, consider the weight capacity of the tarp to ensure it can securely cover the items you plan to protect. A tarp's weight can also impact its wind resistance, so consider this factor as well. 


### Strength and Durability

The strength and durability of a heavy-duty tarp is crucial for long-term use. Look for tarps with reinforced edges, grommets, and tapes that can withstand wear and tear. Opt for tarps with a high thread count, denier rating, and mil rating to ensure they can endure the toughest conditions. Additionally, consider factors like UV resistance and mold resistance when selecting a tarp that can withstand long-term exposure to the elements.

### What is a heavy duty tarp?

A sturdy, robust, and highly resistant polyethylene sheeting, a heavy-duty tarp is designed to protect various objects, including boats, cars, and large cargo containers. These tarps are resistant to harsh conditions like heavy rain, snow, and strong winds without tearing or getting damaged. 

The durability of heavy duty tarps comes in various sizes, shapes, and thicknesses to cater to specific needs of users. They have found their place in the industrial, agricultural, and marine sectors, safeguarding valuable assets and equipment from environmental elements and potential harm during transportation and storage. 


### What materials are heavy duty tarps made of?

Heavy-duty tarps are typically constructed from first-rate, high-strength polyethylene (PE), a type of plastic that is resistant to tears, punctures, and UV radiation. This material withstands extreme temperatures and strong winds without losing its sturdiness. 

The thickness of the polyethylene used in heavy-duty tarps ranges from 450D to 1000D, depending on the intended use and the level of protection required. Thicker tarps are generally more enduring and long-lasting, making them ideal for uses where the tarp will be exposed to extreme weather conditions or rough handling.

### What is the distinction between heavy-duty and standard tarps?

The fundamental difference between heavy-duty and standard tarps lies in their material thickness, resilience, and resistance to wear and tear. Heavy-duty tarps are crafted from thicker polyethylene material, making them more resistant to tears, punctures, and UV radiation than standard tarps. They also provide better protection for the objects they cover in harsh conditions. 

Conversely, standard tarps are constructed from thinner polyethylene material, resulting in a more affordable and lightweight product. However, they are less robust and less resistant to wear and tear, providing less protection in challenging environments than heavy-duty tarps. Standard tarps are suitable for lighter-duty applications, such as covering smaller objects or providing temporary shelter. 


### How do I select the correct size heavy-duty tarp for my needs?

Selecting the right size heavy-duty tarp involves determining the dimensions of the object it will be covering. Adding a few extra inches on all sides ensures complete coverage and protection from the elements. Moreover, consulting with a supplier or your local hardware store can provide professional guidance in choosing the correct size for your needs. 

Heavy-duty tarps are available in various dimensions like 10x12 feet, 12x16 feet, 16x20 feet, and 20x25 feet. While unsure of the correct size, it is better to err on the side of caution and opt for a slightly larger tarp to ensure proper coverage and protection for your valuable assets and equipment. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Heavy+Duty+Tarp"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Heavy-Duty-Tarp-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Heavy-Duty-Tarp-6" height="540"></a></div>


### What are the common applications of heavy-duty tarps?

 Heavy-duty tarps have countless uses across different industries. Some frequent applications include protecting boats, cars, and other transportation mechanisms from adverse weather during transportation, safeguarding agricultural and construction equipment during storage, and temporarily sheltering or shading at outdoor gatherings or structures. 

 Moreover, heavy-duty tarps are essential in construction sites for covering and protecting material piles, machinery, and equipment during storage and transition. They can be used to establish temporary coverings like shelters or facilities in open environments without immediate access to permanent structures. 


### Where should I store my heavy-duty tarp when it is not in use?

 When not in use, heavy-duty tarps should be stored in a spotless, dry, and well-ventilated domain to prevent the buildup of mold, mildew, or other contaminants. A garage, shed, or storage room with proper ventilation is an appropriate place to store your heavy-duty tarp. It is crucial to keep the tarp raised off the floor to avoid moisture seeping in and damaging the material. 

 Before storing, it is beneficial to fold the heavy-duty tarp correctly. Lay it out flat and fold it in half horizontally, then in half vertically. This will create an organized bundle that is easy to store and transport when required. Correct storage and maintenance prolong the life of your heavy-duty tarp and ensure it remains in optimal condition for future use.
