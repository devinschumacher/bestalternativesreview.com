After switching from clips to flats for a more casual, all-terrain mountain bike experience, I stumbled upon the Giro Jacket II Cycling Shoes. They were everything I hoped for and more, delivering the perfect blend of style and functionality. 

The style of these shoes immediately won me over - the sleek, skate shoe-esque design is eye-catching and looks great, especially when paired with casual outfits like jeans or shorts. The Vibram sole was one of the standout features, providing excellent grip on both pedals and various terrains. Giro's decision to opt-in for a full-length molded Vibram rubber high-traction lugged outsole was a game-changer for me. Not only did it offer superior pedal feedback, but engineered lugs at the pedal zone made it even more effective in maintaining grip on pedals and even the rockiest of surfaces. 

Another aspect of these shoes that I appreciated was the EVA midsole, which surprisingly absorbed impact well, particularly during hikes or landing on jumps.

Furthermore, the synthetic leather upper had plenty of ventilation holes, allowing for breathability and temperature regulation. 

Despite these many pros, there were some areas where the Giro Jacket II Cycling Shoe underperformed. For example, I encountered issues with the laces being far too long and sometimes creating a tripping hazard. In addition, some users have mentioned that the inner sole is quite thin, which may lead to discomfort or lack of support for individuals with high arches. 

Overall, the Giro Jacket II shoes turned out to be an exceptional addition to my everyday outdoor adventures. The blend of comfort, durability, and grip, alongside the eye-catching design, makes this shoe an appealing choice for those looking for a versatile, all-terrain alternative to traditional cycling footwear. While the minor drawbacks may disappoint some users, I believe the pros outweigh the cons, and I would definitely recommend giving these shoes a try.

The Giro Men's Rumble VR Cycling Shoes effortlessly blend comfort and performance, making them a versatile choice for both biking and hiking. The mesh and synthetic upper provide breathability, keeping your feet cool during long rides. The rubber Vibram outsole ensures a strong grip on both wet and dry trails. The laced closure offers a secure fit, while the EVA midsole and footbed provide support. 

My experience with these shoes has been nothing short of pleasantly surprising. The first thing that stood out for me was the comfortable fit. The shoes wrap around my feet snugly and securely, ensuring a stable and solid footing, especially when clipped in on the pedals. This secure fit is crucial for maintaining efficiency and control in both on and off-road conditions. 

The Vibram rubber outsole has made a significant difference in terms of traction on the trails and smooth surfaces. This has allowed me to tackle obstacles with ease and confidence, without worrying about slipping or sliding. The durability of the sole has also been noteworthy; I haven't noticed any wear and tear after several months of use. 

However, the outsole does have a slight drawback, which I discovered while navigating rocky paths. The texture can occasionally be too aggressive, resulting in an uncomfortable scraping sensation on my foot. This may not be an issue for everyone, but it is something to be aware of. 

One feature that has received mixed reviews is the EVA midsole. Some reviewers have praised its cushioning for providing added comfort, while others have reported it to be too firm for long road rides. In my case, it provided good support during my hikes and more casual rides, but I did find it to be slightly less effective in terms of absorption on harder surfaces. 

In summary, the Giro Men's Rumble VR Cycling Shoes are a great choice for those seeking a functional, stylish, and versatile option for cycling and hiking. While they may not be perfect for every situation or terrain, the overall performance and comfort make them a valuable addition to any bike collection.

I recently decided to try out the Giro Women's Stylus Shoe in white, and I'm happy with my decision. The slim, sleek design looked great and felt really comfy right out of the box. One of the things that stood out to me was the Synchwire single-piece composite upper that wraps around my foot like a second skin, providing the perfect balance of support and ventilation. The three compression-molded Velcro straps keep the shoe nice and tight, allowing me to pedal with all my might. 

While the shoe is lightweight and easy to clean, I did notice that it runs a bit small, especially in the toe box. I ended up going a size up to get the right fit. Overall, it's a solid choice for those who are looking for a reliable, good-looking shoe that won't break the bank. Just make sure you size up if you have wider feet!
