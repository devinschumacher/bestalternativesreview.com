### [VelocityOne Flight Refurbished Universal Control System](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Honeycomb+Flight+Controls?utm\_term=velocityone-flight-refurbished-universal-control-system)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Honeycomb+Flight+Controls?utm_term=velocityone-flight-refurbished-universal-control-system"><img alt="velocityone-flight-refurbished-universal-control-system-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/velocityone-flight-refurbished-universal-control-system-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a flight simulator enthusiast, I recently tried the VelocityOne Flight Universal Control System from Turtle Beach. This refurbished system comes with a wide range of features designed to provide an immersive and realistic flying experience. 

Firstly, the Honeycomb Flight Controls are a standout feature. They offer precise and smooth control that gives the user a sense of actually flying in the virtual cockpit. However, I did notice that there's a bit of force needed to push, pull or roll, making it feel less authentic than in real-life flight. 

Another major issue I faced was with the side throttle and assignable button attachment. While they look and feel great, the smoothness of the yoke is severely lacking. It proved to be quite difficult to smoothly transition climb/dive movements. Additionally, the headphone jack on the side of the unit is a complete disaster, producing noise and causing the sound to cut on and off randomly. 

Despite these drawbacks, I must say that there's a lot to love about this product. The many aircraft settings that can be controlled with this system are a definite bonus, and it's easy to set up and use with Microsoft Simulator. Plus, the product arrived quickly and well-packed. 

In conclusion, the VelocityOne Flight Universal Control System has plenty of great features and a reasonable price tag. However, some issues like the lack of smoothness in the yoke and the poor quality of the headphone jack detract from the overall experience. I would recommend this product for flight simulation enthusiasts, but only if they can overlook these minor inconveniences.

The universal functionality of this all-in-one cockpit system was exactly what I needed for my diverse flight preferences, from single-engine planes to multi-engine airliners. 

One of the standout features for me was the autopilot panel, which included functions that you'd find in commercial and GA aircraft. This was incredibly useful in providing a realistic, immersive experience. The annunciator panel also caught my attention, with its 14 signal lights indicating important status and warning messages from the onboard systems. It was nice to have this level of information at my fingertips during a flight. 

However, there were a few minor drawbacks to note. The flap switch had a bit of an unexpected 'click' when I used it, as if there might be some sand or debris inside. But overall, it didn't detract from the overall quality of the product. Another small concern was that the trim wheel wasn't an analogue axis, which I found out could easily be remedied with 3rd party software. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I have been thoroughly satisfied with the Honeycomb Aeronautical Bravo Throttle Quadrant. It is well-built, functional, and offers a nice balance between accessibility and authenticity in its simulations.
