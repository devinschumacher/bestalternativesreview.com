### [LeBron Ambassador 13 'Empire Jade' Sports Shoes](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Joel+Embiid+Shoes?utm\_term=lebron-ambassador-13-empire-jade-sports-shoes)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Joel+Embiid+Shoes?utm_term=lebron-ambassador-13-empire-jade-sports-shoes"><img alt="nike-lebron-ambassador-13-empire-jade-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/nike-lebron-ambassador-13-empire-jade-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Nike LeBron Ambassador 13 'Empire Jade' was my recent go-to for the basketball court. I've tried other signature shoes, but Nike really nailed the functionality with this pair. The cushioning is top-notch and provides the necessary protection during intense games. The slip-resistant sole ensures I stay stable on the court, while the wrapping design means they fit like a glove. 

The colorway of white/green is a standout, making me feel like a basketball star. The upper material is a mix of fabric and TPU, which makes them comfortable and durable. The rubber sole is excellent for grip, and the round toe and flat heel feel perfect for my foot shape. 

While basketball shoes should ideally be limited to the season, these shoes are all-season, allowing me the flexibility to wear them year-round. The overall style definitely has a sports vibe, making it a suitable choice for the court. 

However, I did notice that the lacing system could use some improvement - it's challenging to tighten and loosen the shoe without it feeling too tight or loose. But overall, the Nike LeBron Ambassador 13 'Empire Jade' is a fantastic addition to any basketball enthusiast's wardrobe. 


### [Slime Joel Embiid x Puma MB.02 Signature Basketball Shoes](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Joel+Embiid+Shoes?utm\_term=slime-joel-embiid-x-puma-mb-02-signature-basketball-shoes)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Joel+Embiid+Shoes?utm_term=slime-joel-embiid-x-puma-mb-02-signature-basketball-shoes"><img alt="puma-mb-02-x-slime-basketball-shoes-green-mens-size-9-m-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/puma-mb-02-x-slime-basketball-shoes-green-mens-size-9-m-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a basketball enthusiast, I've always been on the lookout for comfortable yet stylish shoes. I must admit, the Puma MB. 02 x Slime Basketball Shoes immediately caught my eye. Being a fan of Puma footwear, I was eager to try out the latest addition to their lineup. 

From the moment I slipped these bad boys on, I could feel a distinct difference in terms of comfort. The shoes' cushioning was remarkable, even better than some other shoes I've worn before. The mesh upper material offered a breathable experience that kept my feet feeling cool and dry during intense gameplay. 

One of the features that stood out the most was the TPU heel clip. This added an extra layer of support and stability, ensuring my footing remained steady on the court. The non-slip rubber outsole also played a significant role in my performance, as it allowed me to maintain a firm grip regardless of the surface I was playing on. 

While the sizing took some getting used to - the shoes may run slightly larger or smaller depending on the individual - the overall fit was quite akin to a slipper, offering an impressive level of comfort and support. 

That being said, I did encounter a minor issue with the laces occasionally being too short. This didn't impact my comfort while playing basketball, but it can be a tiny bit bothersome when tying them up. 

Despite the minor setback, I've grown to love the Puma MB. 02 x Slime Basketball Shoes for their innovative design, attention to comfort, and solid footing. For fellow basketball players seeking a reliable pair of shoes that blend style and performance, I highly recommend giving these a go.

In my quest to find a comfy and stylish pair of sneakers, I stumbled upon the New Balance 650. The sleek design, featuring premium leather and an elevated look, caught my eye right away. 

But what really won me over was the lace-up closure and cushioned footbed. I've been wearing these sneakers daily, and they've become my go-to for game days and casual outings alike. The rubber outsole offers solid grip and traction, making these shoes ideal for high-strung activity. 

While some reviewers have mentioned sizing concerns, overall, I've been really happy with my purchase. So if you're looking for a stylish and comfortable pair of sneakers, the New Balance 650 might just be the perfect fit. 


### [New Balance Joel Embiid Inside Voices Blue Shoes](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Joel+Embiid+Shoes?utm\_term=new-balance-joel-embiid-inside-voices-blue-shoes)

I recently tried the New Balance 9060 Joe Freshgoods Inside Voices Baby Shower Blue, and I have to say, I was quite impressed with the overall design and feel of these shoes. The pale yellow mesh construction provides a breathable and comfortable base for the blue suede overlays, while the gold New Balance logos add a touch of sophistication. 

One standout feature for me was the subtle "Inside Voices" embroidery at the heel. It's a small detail, but it adds a nice personal touch to these shoes. The hits of pink on the sockliner and sculptural sole are also a pleasant surprise in terms of color coordination. 

Although the shoes are advertised to retail for $180, I found them to be priced reasonably, given the quality and style. The product release in May 2022 made them an exciting addition to my collection. 

In terms of comfort, the New Balance 9060 Joe Freshgoods Inside Voices Baby Shower Blue didn't disappoint. I found them to be quite snug, fitting true to size. After a day of wear, I experienced no blisters or sore spots. 

One potential downside is that the shoes may not be the most suitable for casual outings, as their more athletic look may not mesh well with dressier attire. Additionally, some users have reported sizing issues, so it's essential to pay attention to the size chart to ensure a proper fit. 

Overall, the New Balance 9060 Joe Freshgoods Inside Voices Baby Shower Blue is a stylish and comfortable addition to my footwear collection. Its unique design and thoughtful touches make it a standout option for those seeking a versatile casual shoe. 


### [Aime Leon Dore x New Balance 650R 'White Green' Limited Edition Shoes - Joel Embiid's Favorite](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Joel+Embiid+Shoes?utm\_term=aime-leon-dore-x-new-balance-650r-white-green-limited-edition-shoes-joel-embiids-favorite)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Joel+Embiid+Shoes?utm_term=aime-leon-dore-x-new-balance-650r-white-green-limited-edition-shoes-joel-embiids-favorite"><img alt="aime-leon-dore-x-650r-green-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/aime-leon-dore-x-650r-green-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the New Balance 650R Aime Leon Dore White Green, and I must say, I was quite impressed with this throwback '80s hoops shoe. The limited edition release in July 2021 offered a stylish two-tone palette of white and green, featuring a full-grain leather upper with contrasting accents. The shoes feature a comfortable padded mesh collar and a durable rubber cupsole with exposed EVA wedge. 

However, while the shoes themselves were great, the packaging left something to be desired. I received two pairs in the same shoe box, which definitely was not the most efficient use of space. Overall, I'd recommend these shoes for their classic look and feel, but be aware that there might be some QC issues with the packaging. 


### [Under Armour Embiid One - High-Performance Basketball Shoes](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Joel+Embiid+Shoes?utm\_term=under-armour-embiid-one-high-performance-basketball-shoes)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Joel+Embiid+Shoes?utm_term=under-armour-embiid-one-high-performance-basketball-shoes"><img alt="under-armour-embiid-one-brotherly-love-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/under-armour-embiid-one-brotherly-love-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Under Armour Embiid One: The Ultimate Basketball Shoe

During last weekend's basketball game, the Under Armour Embiid One proved to be an impressive choice. I was thrilled to experience the shoe's unique blend of functionality, comfort, and style. 

One of the standout features of the Embiid One is its Micro-G cushioning in the forefoot, which allows for explosive footwork during sudden direction changes. The shoe's high-wrapping midsole keeps my foot locked in and provides excellent stability, especially during aggressive cuts to the basket. This extra support proved invaluable during sidestep blocks and helped me maintain better control on the court. 

Additionally, the shoe's UA HOVR technology and Energy Web network effectively absorbs impacts on the ground and returns the energy, making every stride feel light and responsive. This technology helped protect my back and ankles from high-force impacts while also providing the comfort and support needed for a full-energy performance. 

The rubber sole provided maximum grip and traction, ensuring stable footing and enabling quick movements. The wide lateral wings also added extra support and stability, making the shoe suitable for players with medium width feet. 

However, there were a couple of cons worth mentioning. Firstly, the shoe is a bit on the heavy side compared to other models, which could hinder a player's speed and agility. Secondly, the mid-height ankle padding dug into my ankle a bit, potentially causing discomfort and annoyance during continuous use. 

Overall, the Under Armour Embiid One proved to be an excellent choice for basketball players looking for a blend of comfort, durability, and responsiveness. Its impressive features allowed me to achieve better performance and confidence on the court. My only wish is for some improvements in the shoe's weight and ankle padding. 


### [Under Armour Embiid 1 CNY: Joel Embiid Men's Red Trainers](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Joel+Embiid+Shoes?utm\_term=under-armour-embiid-1-cny-joel-embiid-mens-red-trainers)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Joel+Embiid+Shoes?utm_term=under-armour-embiid-1-cny-joel-embiid-mens-red-trainers"><img alt="under-armour-embiid-1-cny-mens-red-trainers-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/under-armour-embiid-1-cny-mens-red-trainers-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Under Armour Embiid 1 Cny Men's Red Trainers are a great choice for those looking for a basketball shoe with a sporty touch. The design is inspired by the professional basketball player Joel Embiid, making it perfect for someone wanting to bring their game to the next level. 

One thing that stood out to me is the HOVR technology that provides energy absorption and return with every step, which helped me feel powerful and explosive on the court. The Micro-G technology also gave me great precision for my cuts and turns, allowing me to make quick decisions and stay one step ahead of the competition. 

The lightweight mesh upper was another feature that impressed me, as it provided the perfect balance of breathability, mobility, and stability during my time on the court. However, the insole pad coming off was a big disappointment for me. It was uncomfortable to play with and caused some discomfort while playing. Overall, the Under Armour Embiid 1 Cny Men's Red Trainers were a solid choice for a sports shoe, but with the insole issue, it may not be the perfect fit for everyone.

The LIGHTLOCK upper ensures a secure fit, and the Propulsion plate enhances responsiveness during high-impact movements. While the quality of materials could be improved, the price makes up for it, making these a must-have addition to any sneaker enthusiast's collection. 


### [Nike LeBron 18 Empire Jade: The Joel Embiid Signature Shoe](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Joel+Embiid+Shoes?utm\_term=nike-lebron-18-empire-jade-the-joel-embiid-signature-shoe)

The unique blend of high-tech Knitposite 2.0 fabric, ballistic nylon, and rubber overlays created a snug yet breathable fit. I particularly loved the semi-translucent bubbles on the geometric tongue – they added a touch of style to my look without compromising on comfort. 

My favorite part, though, was the full-length Zoom Air unit in the articulated midsole. This cushioning technology provided an energy return that was hard to match. It not only made my runs more comfortable, but it also boosted my performance. The thick bottom of the heel offered stability and support, making it a perfect choice for all-season use. 

The Empire Jade's design, inspired by a jade seal, was a beautiful sight to behold. The light green hue with red accents made it stand out from the crowd. However, despite the appealing looks, the price point was a bit steep for some – but for those looking for top-notch performance, this sneaker was well worth the investment. 

Overall, the Nike LeBron 18 EP 'Empire Jade' was a game-changer in my daily routine. Its blend of style, comfort, and performance made it an essential addition to my shoe collection.

A midfoot TPU shank provided excellent torsional rigidity, while the molded textile upper enabled a secure lockdown fit without adding extra weight. The tongue label, featuring a custom 'TWO WXY' brain graphic, added a unique touch. 

However, there was one downside - the sizing. I had a bit of an issue with the narrowness of the shoes, and found that sizing up didn't completely solve the problem. This might not be an issue for everyone, but it was something I noticed and wanted to mention. 

Overall, the New Balance Two WXY V3 Men's Basketball Shoes have been a great addition to my daily life, providing the perfect blend of comfort, performance, and unique design. If you're looking to add some style and power to your game, these shoes are definitely worth considering.
