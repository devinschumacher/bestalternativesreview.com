### [Drew Barrymore White Icing Personal Blender Set (12 Pieces, 240W)](https://serp.ly/amazon/Instant+Blender?utm\_term=drew-barrymore-white-icing-personal-blender-set-12-pieces-240w)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Instant+Blender?utm_term=drew-barrymore-white-icing-personal-blender-set-12-pieces-240w"><img alt="beautiful-personal-blender-set-with-12-pieces-240-w-white-icing-by-drew-barrymore-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/beautiful-personal-blender-set-with-12-pieces-240-w-white-icing-by-drew-barrymore-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

In my quest for a personal blender, I stumbled upon the Beautiful Personal Blender Set by Drew Barrymore. I have been using it daily for a few weeks now, and I must say, it has been a game-changer for my morning smoothies. The sleek design and elegant color complement my kitchen decor, and it's easy to find a spot for it on my countertop. 

One of the highlights of this blender is the powerful 240-watt motor that effortlessly handles even frozen fruits. Its compact size and twist-and-blend operation make it incredibly user-friendly. The 16-ounce travel cup with Drew's signature No Drippy Sippy flexible straw is a great addition, perfect for my on-the-go lifestyle. I also appreciate the dishwasher-safe cups and jars, which have made cleaning a breeze. 

However, there are a couple of downsides I've experienced. The blender tends to be quite loud when in use, which can be bothersome if you're sensitive to noise. Additionally, the travel cup is quite small, which might not be enough for those who like larger servings. Overall, I believe this blender has more pros than cons, and it has certainly made my smoothie-making experience more enjoyable.

The handle makes it easy to carry around, and the compact size fits perfectly in my backpack. Every time I use it, the flavored water I make with the infuser basket tastes incredibly refreshing. 

One major downside is that the blade material isn't specified – I'd assume stainless steel based on the product specs, but it would be nice to know for sure. The blender is powered by 2 Lithium Ion batteries, which are included, and they last long enough to blend through 15+ cycles. 

In terms of performance, it's impressive to see that it can handle both smoothies and protein shakes with ease. The only downside in the visual appeal department might be the color options, but the one I picked is super vibrant and eye-catching.
