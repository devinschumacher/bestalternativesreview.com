### [Lancome Tresor Eau de Parfum Spray](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lancome+Tresor?utm\_term=lancome-tresor-eau-de-parfum-spray)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lancome+Tresor?utm_term=lancome-tresor-eau-de-parfum-spray"><img alt="lancome-tresor-for-women-1-0-oz-edp-spray-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/lancome-tresor-for-women-1-0-oz-edp-spray-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Lancome Tresor for Women, a 1.0 oz EDP Spray, has been a part of my life for quite some time now. It was gifted to me by my grandmother and I've been using it regularly ever since. The moment I spray it on, I feel immediately transported to a more fragrant time. The scent is a perfect blend of lilac, rose, apricot, amber, and musk, which gives it a unique aroma that I haven't come across in any other perfume. 

One thing that stands out to me is the medium sillage it has. It doesn't overpower the room, but it's strong enough to be noticed by those around me. I find this to be a nice balance as it's not too loud, but also not too subtle. It lasts on my skin for about 6 hours and on my clothes for an even longer duration. 

The bottle design is quite elegant too. It's simple yet classy, adding a touch of sophistication to my everyday life. I appreciate the fact that it's compact, making it easy to carry around wherever I go. 

However, one downside I've noticed is that the fragrance seems to have become weaker over time. I remember when it first came out, it was much stronger and lasted longer on my skin. But now, it seems to wane away a bit sooner. 

Despite this minor drawback, I would still recommend the Lancome Tresor for Women. Its unique scent, elegant design, and medium sillage make it a worthwhile addition to anyone's daily routine.

When I first encountered Lancome's Tresor Gift Set, I was drawn in by the elegant packaging that housed the L'Eau de Parfum, Perfumed Body Lotion, and Precious Perfumed Shower Gel. The beautiful blend of lychee and raspberry in the perfume created a refreshing and captivating scent that I couldn't help but fall in love with. 

One of the things that stood out to me about the Tresor Gift Set is its incredible wear. Even after a long day, the scent lingered, making it perfect for those who want their fragrance to last. The addition of the body lotion and shower gel in the gift set also added a touch of luxuriousness to my routine. 

While the gift set offers exceptional value and a great way to add some romance to someone's life, I will admit that I discovered the perfume doesn't come with sample sizes, which could be a drawback for someone who may be looking to try before they buy. 

Overall, the Lancome Tresor Gift Set is a beautiful and captivating fragrance that any recipient would be thrilled to receive, making it a standout in my daily routine. It may not be perfect, but I think it's worth it for the refreshing, sweet scent and the luxurious feel it brings to any day. 


### [Sensual Lancôme Tresor Gift Set for Women](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lancome+Tresor?utm\_term=sensual-lancôme-tresor-gift-set-for-women)

I've always been a fan of Lancôme's scents, but Tresor has a special place in my heart. The first time I tried it, I was immediately drawn to the soft notes of rose, apricot, and musk in the Eau de Parfum. It's a subtle, yet distinct scent that reminds me of a time when everything felt simpler. 

Aside from the delicious fragrance, I love the luxurious packaging of the gift set. The glossy gold of the precious perfume shower makes it stand out on any bathroom counter, and the delicate glass of the Eau de Parfum fits perfectly in my handbag. 

One minor drawback I've experienced is that the parfum can be quite potent. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it can be overwhelming to some people. 

Overall, the Lancôme Tresor gift set is a thoughtful and decadent present for any woman who appreciates a timeless, elegant scent. The set offers a perfect balance of indulgence and practicality, making it a versatile gift for any occasion.

Touched with a hint of warm amber, the final result is a soft and refined fragrance that leaves a lasting impression. 

The versatility of Tresor by Lancome is one of its key highlights. One small spritz is all you need to elevate your daily routine with its romantic and sophisticated charm. However, I must admit that the scent strength might be a bit overpowering for some, making it a bit difficult to enjoy without drawing unwanted attention. 

Overall, the Tresor by Lancome Gift Set is an excellent choice for women who appreciate classic and refined fragrances. The 1.7 fl oz size is perfect for traveling or as a thoughtful gift for a loved one.

### [Lancôme Tresor Oriental Floral Eau de Parfum](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lancome+Tresor?utm\_term=lancôme-tresor-oriental-floral-eau-de-parfum)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lancome+Tresor?utm_term=lancôme-tresor-oriental-floral-eau-de-parfum"><img alt="lanc-me-tr-sor-3-4-oz-100-ml-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/lanc-me-tr-sor-3-4-oz-100-ml-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The moment I spray it on, I'm transported back to those sweet memories, the gentle breeze of spring, and the intoxicating bloom of new love. 

This feminine fragrance has a blend of lilac, apricot, and amber, creating a unique aroma that I haven't found in any other perfume. The apricot blossom and rose top notes give it a soothing aroma that feels both comforting and exhilarating.
