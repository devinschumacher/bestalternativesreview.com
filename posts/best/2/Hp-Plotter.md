### [HP DesignJet 500 Large Format Inkjet Printer: Office-Friendly Solution](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Hp+Plotter?utm\_term=hp-designjet-500-large-format-inkjet-printer-office-friendly-solution)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Hp+Plotter?utm_term=hp-designjet-500-large-format-inkjet-printer-office-friendly-solution"><img alt="hp-designjet-500-1-rolls-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hp-designjet-500-1-rolls-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [HP DesignJet Z9+: High-Definition Postscript Printer for Enhanced Print Speed and Quality](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Hp+Plotter?utm\_term=hp-designjet-z9-high-definition-postscript-printer-for-enhanced-print-speed-and-quality)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Hp+Plotter?utm_term=hp-designjet-z9-high-definition-postscript-printer-for-enhanced-print-speed-and-quality"><img alt="hp-designjet-z9-24-in-postscript-printer-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hp-designjet-z9-24-in-postscript-printer-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Recently, I had the chance to test out the HP DesignJet Z9+ printer, a 24-inch postscript printer offering expanded gamut with RGB HP Vivid Photo Inks and an embedded spectrophotometer. Right off the bat, I was impressed with how easily I could design applications from posters to banners with the integrated HP Applications Center. 

One feature that stood out to me was the integrated vertical trimmer. It made post-processing time so much faster, cutting my labor time up to 20%. The printer's speed was also remarkable, as it could print up to 2.5 times faster without losing quality thanks to its 2400 nozzle-per-inch high-definition print heads. 

The lack of a need for light inks was another positive aspect. The high-definition HP print heads used dual drop technology, producing more brilliant prints with fewer ink droplets. The nozzles were designed to be more precise, delivering excellent color reproduction, and the print quality was impressive for such a large format printer. 

However, as much as I liked the advanced features of the HP DesignJet Z9+, it wasn't without its drawbacks. The printer's price tag is quite high, and the running costs, especially when considering the ink cartridges and consumables, can add up fast. 

Additionally, the absence of a USB connector was a bit inconvenient, and I found myself missing that familiar plug-and-play convenience. The learning curve for the software was a bit steeper than I was used to, and it took a while to get used to the various configurations and settings. 

Overall, I have mixed feelings about the HP DesignJet Z9+. It's a fantastic printer with many impressive features, but the high price and occasional inconveniences make it a challenging choice for some users. If you're willing to invest time and money for top-notch print quality and easy design implementation, you might find that this printer is worth the investment. But if you're looking for an all-around cost-effective solution, you may want to look elsewhere. 


### [HP DesignJet T650: 36" Large Format Giclee Printer](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Hp+Plotter?utm\_term=hp-designjet-t650-36-large-format-giclee-printer)

It offers flexibility with a variety of media sizes and types, from A4 to A0 and plain paper to film, making it perfect for different uses.

Overall, the T650 can be a great addition to your office if you need a versatile and fast printer that fits your space requirements, but remember to plan for the potential limitations and maintenance it may require. 


### [HP T850 36" Wireless Wide Format Inkjet Printer](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Hp+Plotter?utm\_term=hp-t850-36-wireless-wide-format-inkjet-printer)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Hp+Plotter?utm_term=hp-t850-36-wireless-wide-format-inkjet-printer"><img alt="hp-designjet-t850-36-wireless-wide-format-inkjet-printer-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hp-designjet-t850-36-wireless-wide-format-inkjet-printer-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The HP DesignJet T850 has been a game-changer in my daily work routine. As a project manager, I often deal with large-format print jobs, and this 36-inch wide format inkjet printer has made the process incredibly efficient. The wireless connectivity means I can print from anywhere in my house or office, without being tethered to a specific computer. 

One thing that truly stands out about this printer is its ink technology. HP's Flex Tech Inks have allowed me to achieve high-quality prints with crisp text and vibrant colors. The integrated ink cartridges and printhead also make refilling a breeze, saving me a significant amount of time and potential frustration. 

However, there are two aspects of this printer that I would like to see improved. Firstly, the printer could use a quieter operation mode for those of us who work in shared spaces or have colleagues nearby. The current operating noise level of 42 dBA becomes a little intrusive in my open-concept office. Secondly, I would love to see HP explore the option of additional USB ports for the printer, as the single port on the top of the unit can sometimes be inconveniently located. 

Overall, the HP DesignJet T850 is an excellent choice for anyone looking for an easy-to-use, efficient, and versatile large-format printer. Its wireless capabilities are a game-changer, and the ink technology offers impressive print quality. Although there is room for improvement with noise reduction and additional ports, the advantages of this printer far outweigh these minor drawbacks.
