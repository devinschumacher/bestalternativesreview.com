However, one downside I discovered when using the backpack was the lack of separate compartments for different items. This made organizing my school supplies a bit of a challenge, and at times I found myself fishing through the main compartment for a specific pen or book.

However, there were a couple of things I noticed that might be worth considering. First, the bag is made of 100% polyester, which means it might not be the most breathable option when carrying wet or sweaty clothes.
