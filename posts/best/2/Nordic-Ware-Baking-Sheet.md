Just think about the hours you'll save from scrubbing those pesky residues! And oh, the best part? It's produced in the US, so you can brag about its "Made In The USA" badge. 

Of course, it wasn't all roses. There's a little hand-wash requirement for maintaining this beast, which might be a teeny bit inconvenient, but hey, isn't that the price we pay for a heavenly piece of bakeware? 

There are some skeptics out there, but the majority is happy with its sturdy construction and durability. A few, however, reported receiving it damaged. I guess that's a risk you have to take when dealing with online orders.

Yes, Nordic Ware baking sheets are remarkably easy to clean. The non-stick surface prevents food from sticking to the sheet, making cleanup a breeze. Simply wipe the sheet down with a damp cloth or sponge, and it will be ready for its next use. If stubborn bits of food remain, they can usually be removed with a little gentle scrubbing using a soft brush or sponge. 

Additionally, after years of use, the non-stick coating might wear off slightly, but it can be easily restored by placing the sheet in the oven at 350Â°F (175Â°C) for about 20 minutes. This will help the coating re-bond to the aluminum, ensuring the sheet continues to perform optimally. Proper care and maintenance ensure that these baking sheets maintain their excellent cleaning properties. 


### Which size of Nordic Ware baking sheet is most suitable for everyday use?

For everyday baking, the 18x12x1-inch rectangle shape baking sheet is a versatile option. This size suits a wide variety of dishes and can easily accommodate multiple items, such as cookies, muffins, and appetizers. Its dimensions offer the right balance between storage space, ease of use, and versatility in the kitchen. 

However, if you have storage constraints or prefer smaller sizes for specific recipes, Nordic Ware offers a range of other sizes, such as the 13x18-inch rectangle shape baking sheet or the 10x15-inch rectangular shape baking sheet. The choice depends on your needs, preferences, and the types of recipes you frequently prepare at home. 


### Why should I choose Nordic Ware baking sheets over other brands?

Nordic Ware baking sheets are a premium choice for serious bakers due to their superior quality and performance. Their heavy-gauge aluminum construction ensures even heat distribution, which results in perfect, evenly baked goods with a golden-brown finish. The non-stick surface makes cleanup a breeze and prevents food from sticking to the sheet.

A single investment in a Nordic Ware baking sheet means you can enjoy professional-quality baked goods right in your own kitchen, all without the need to replace your baking sheet frequently. This makes them a cost-effective and eco-friendly option in the long run. 


### Is it safe to put Nordic Ware baking sheets in the dishwasher?

Nordic Ware baking sheets are not recommended for dishwasher use. While it's understandable to want to take advantage of a dishwasher's convenience, the high temperatures and harsh detergents used in these appliances can damage the non-stick surface and impact the product's overall performance over time. Additionally, handwashing your baking sheets ensures that they'll last longer and won't lose their non-stick properties more quickly. 

To clean your Nordic Ware baking sheet, simply wipe it down with a damp cloth or sponge after use. If food particles remain, use a soft brush or sponge to gently remove them. If the non-stick coating becomes worn over time, you can restore it by placing the sheet in a 350Â°F (175Â°C) oven for about 20 minutes. Proper care and maintenance will help your baking sheet maintain its great performance and appearance over the years.
