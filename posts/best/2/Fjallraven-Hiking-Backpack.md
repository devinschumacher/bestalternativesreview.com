The side slip pocket for my water bottle was a pleasant surprise, adding an extra layer of convenience to my busy day. The dual top handles with snap closure made it effortless to carry, and the adjustable shoulder straps ensured a comfortable fit. 

However, there were a couple of things I noticed that might be a drawback for some users. The material of the backpack feels a bit stiffer than I expected, but it seems to be holding up well after constant use. Another thing I found was the lack of a separate internal pocket to clip my keys in, which left me searching for them in my main compartment from time to time. 

Overall, I can't deny the convenience the Fjallraven Kanken Warm Yellow Backpack has brought to my life. Its unique design, added features, and overall functionality make it an excellent choice for those looking for a versatile backpack for daily use.
