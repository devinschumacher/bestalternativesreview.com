### [Compact Norton Masonry Saw with Induction Motor](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Masonry+Saw?utm\_term=compact-norton-masonry-saw-with-induction-motor)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Masonry+Saw?utm_term=compact-norton-masonry-saw-with-induction-motor"><img alt="norton-clipper-blockbuster-bbm-series-mini-masonry-saw-electric-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/norton-clipper-blockbuster-bbm-series-mini-masonry-saw-electric-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When I was given the opportunity to try out the Norton Clipper Blockbuster Mini Masonry Saw, I was genuinely excited to see if it lived up to its reputation. As someone who regularly works with masonry tools, I'm used to handling heavy-duty equipment, but I was interested to see how this compact, all-steel saw would perform. 

Right from the get-go, I appreciated the ergonomically-designed cutting head, which made the saw easy to maneuver. The three-position locking mechanism also proved to be an excellent addition, providing a clear view of the work area for increased safety. 

One feature that really stood out to me was the ability to choose between a 3HP brush motor or a 1.5HP induction motor depending on the job at hand. I appreciated the overload protection and the options for garden hose connection and a channeled-flow water pan for efficiently directing dust and slurry. 

However, the Norton Clipper Mini Masonry Saw was not without its drawbacks. Although the saw is compact and lightweight, the cutting power was sometimes lacking for more demanding masonry tasks. Additionally, while the blade capacity was impressive, I found myself frequently needing to change out the blade due to wear and tear. 

Overall, the Norton Clipper Blockbuster Mini Masonry Saw is a great choice for those who require a versatile, compact tool for their masonry projects. While it may not be the most powerful option on the market, it certainly offers convenience and reliability in a sleek package.

While using this saw, rest assured that your safety is a priority as it features an air filter that's simple to maintain and safeguards the motor from dust and debris.

### [Stark Gas Powerful 13HP Walk-Behind Concrete Saw](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Masonry+Saw?utm\_term=stark-gas-powerful-13hp-walk-behind-concrete-saw)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Masonry+Saw?utm_term=stark-gas-powerful-13hp-walk-behind-concrete-saw"><img alt="stark-gas-18-in-walk-behind-concrete-saw-13-hp-epa-cement-walk-behind-no-blade-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stark-gas-18-in-walk-behind-concrete-saw-13-hp-epa-cement-walk-behind-no-blade-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Stark Gas 18-in. Walk-Behind Concrete Saw, and I must say, it's perfect for smaller jobs. 

This EPA-certified 13 HP 4-cycle gas engine makes it a reliable choice for any masonry project. The saw's guide ensures a straight cut every time, making my work more efficient and precise. However, the water system could be a bit better; it sometimes struggles to provide optimal flow and volume to the blade. 

Despite this minor drawback, I highly recommend this concrete saw for its versatility and power. 


### [Imer Masonry Saw for Efficient Block Cutting](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Masonry+Saw?utm\_term=imer-masonry-saw-for-efficient-block-cutting)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Masonry+Saw?utm_term=imer-masonry-saw-for-efficient-block-cutting"><img alt="imer-masonry-750-30-block-saw-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/imer-masonry-750-30-block-saw-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

One afternoon, I decided to try out the Imer Masonry 750 Block Saw after hearing great things about it. The first thing I noticed was the size; at 60 inches long, 33 inches wide, and 62 inches tall, it's definitely a substantial piece of machinery. Weighing in at a whopping 440 pounds, it's a sturdy beast. 

I was particularly impressed with its power source - a single-phase electric one, no less. This made it a breeze to set up and start cutting. Even more impressive was the blade size - 30 inches long, which was more than enough to slice through some serious block material. 

The cutting depth of 12 inches was also quite noteworthy, allowing me to make some deep, precise cuts. And if you're planning to cut larger sections, don't worry - the plunge feature will cover you. This saw certainly lived up to the hype in terms of efficiency and ease of use. 

However, no product's perfect. The weight was a bit of a challenge to move around, and I do wish the arbor was a bit larger to accommodate some wider blades. But overall, the Imer Masonry 750 Block Saw is a pretty solid choice for anyone looking to make some serious masonry cuts. 


### [Husqvarna Guardmatic MS 610 G Masonry Saw with Clutch Protection](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Masonry+Saw?utm\_term=husqvarna-guardmatic-ms-610-g-masonry-saw-with-clutch-protection)

As someone who values efficiency in their daily life, the Husqvarna Guardmatic MS 610 G Masonry Saw has been a game-changer. On several occasions, I had to cut through blocks of brick or large slabs of stone, and this powerhouse delivered the goods effortlessly. The engine itself is a beast, offering a mighty 14 hp to tackle even the most demanding masonry tasks. 

One feature that stood out to me, both the upsides and the downsides, was the 24-inch blade. On the positive side, it allowed me to cut through block material efficiently, easily handling our projects. However, the downside to its size is the limited options available in ready-to-use blades. 

The convenience of controlling the cutting height using a crank control or foot pedal is a plus, as it simplifies the process and helps maintain accuracy. The Sta-level blade guard is also a welcomed addition â€“ it guarantees the cutting head stays parallel to the table, ensuring straight and precise cuts. 

The saw also comes equipped with a clutch to prevent the blade from spinning while idling, providing peace of mind and extra safety during operation. Overall, while there are a few minor setbacks such as the limited availability of ready-made blades, the Husqvarna Guardmatic MS 610 G Masonry Saw is a sturdy workhorse that more than delivers for those seeking a powerful, efficient masonry tool.
