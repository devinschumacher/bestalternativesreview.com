At first glance, the minimalist design and premium materials used in this product left a favorable impression. I appreciated the brass-gold finish, which harmonized well with my farmhouse aesthetics. Additionally, the water ripple glass shade contributed an air of sophistication to the overall illumination.

Regrettably, the actual user experience didn't quite live up to the product's potential. The brightness was noticeably less than anticipated, somewhat undermining the promised effect. Furthermore, while the water ripple shade was visually appealing, the rhombic pattern struggled to scatter light effectively. 

The most disheartening aspect was the customer service. Two of my orders went unfulfilled, adding a sour note to the entire experience!

However, I must admit it was quite a laborious task, as mentioned by other reviews. With some patience and extra care, the final result was well worth the effort. 

Though the light was advertised as a statement piece, I found it to be a bit more fashion than function. It could have been brighter with a larger wattage bulb, as suggested by one of the reviews.
