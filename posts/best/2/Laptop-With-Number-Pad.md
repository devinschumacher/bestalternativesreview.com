### [Lenovo Ideapad L340 Gaming Laptop - 15.6 Inch HD Display, Intel Core i5-9300H Processor, 8GB DDR4 Ram, 512gb NVMe SSD](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Laptop+With+Number+Pad?utm\_term=lenovo-ideapad-l340-gaming-laptop-15-6-inch-hd-display-intel-core-i5-9300h-processor-8gb-ddr4-ram-512gb-nvme-ssd)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Laptop+With+Number+Pad?utm_term=lenovo-ideapad-l340-gaming-laptop-15-6-inch-hd-display-intel-core-i5-9300h-processor-8gb-ddr4-ram-512gb-nvme-ssd"><img alt="lenovo-ideapad-l340-gaming-laptop-15-6-inch-fhd-1920-x-1080-ips-display-intel-core-i5-9300h-processo-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lenovo-ideapad-l340-gaming-laptop-15-6-inch-fhd-1920-x-1080-ips-display-intel-core-i5-9300h-processo-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Last week, I decided to upgrade my old laptop with something more powerful and advanced. That's when I stumbled upon the Lenovo Ideapad L340 Gaming Laptop. Honestly, I couldn't wait to give it a try! 

The laptop had been advertised as having a 15.6-inch FHD IPS display, and that piqued my interest. But once I unboxed it, I was blown away by its sleek, modern design. The lightweight build felt great in my hands and it was definitely a step above what I was used to. 

The keyboard was another feature that stood out to me. I've always been a fan of number pads on laptops, and this one came with a full 10-digit number pad. It made working on spreadsheets and data analysis a breeze. However, it also came with a peculiar blue backlight which felt a bit odd at first but grew on me over time. 

One thing I immediately noticed when I started using it was how quiet it was. Compared to my previous laptop, the fan barely made a sound, which made for an extremely peaceful and comfortable experience. Plus, the Intel Core i5-9300H Processor delivered a super smooth experience while using it. 

As for the downsides, like any other device, it wasn't perfect. The battery life left a bit to be desired - I found it lasted around only 4 to 5 hours with standard usage. But overall, it wasn't a deal breaker for me. 

What surprised me the most though, was its gaming capabilities. With the integrated NVIDIA GTX 1050 graphics card and 8GB of RAM, it performed impressively. And let's not forget, it weighed less than 5 pounds - perfect for gaming on the go. 

So, would I recommend this Lenovo Ideapad L340 Gaming Laptop? Absolutely! It's a powerful, stylish, and quiet device that can handle your everyday tasks, and with a little bit of enhancement, it even works great for gaming.

Of course, the Chromebook Vibe CX55 Flip is not without its drawbacks. One downside I've noticed is the annoyingly short charging cord, which can be quite limiting when you need to use the laptop for extended periods. Additionally, the Wi-Fi 6 connectivity has been a bit hit or miss, with some connections dropping unexpectedly. 

It's clear that ASUS has gone above and beyond to create a Chromebook that's both stylish and powerful. Whether you're an avid gamer or simply looking for a reliable laptop, the ASUS Chromebook Vibe CX55 Flip is definitely worth considering. Just be prepared to deal with the occasional inconvenience that comes with cloud gaming.

### How does a laptop with a number pad impact ergonomics compared to those without?

Laptops with full-sized keyboards that feature a numeric keypad are often designed with ergonomics in mind. This is because the number pad is typically placed right where the thumb rests, encouraging a more natural hand position when typing. This, in turn, can help prevent strain on the wrists and forearms during extended use. In addition, the presence of a number pad can enhance the overall typing experience by making data entry tasks faster and more efficient.

When shopping for a laptop, ergonomics should be a primary consideration, especially for those who spend extended periods typing. By selecting a laptop with a number pad, you can improve your typing experience and potentially reduce the risk of developing repetitive strain injuries.


### How big is the number pad on a laptop with a full-sized keyboard?

The size of the numeric keypad on a laptop with a full-sized keyboard can vary depending on the make and model. However, in most cases, the number pad is designed to be compact while still offering a layout that allows for basic numerical input. While the keys may be somewhat smaller than those on a standard desktop computer, you should expect the number pad to provide a functional and ergonomic typing experience.

Furthermore, laptop number pads are usually designed with user comfort in mind. Manufacturers aim to find a balance between functionality and ergonomics, ensuring that users can quickly input data while minimizing the risk of developing strain during extended use.
