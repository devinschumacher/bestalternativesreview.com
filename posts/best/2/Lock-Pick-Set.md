### [ECS Auto Parts Advanced Lock Pick Set](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Lock+Pick+Set?utm\_term=ecs-auto-parts-advanced-lock-pick-set)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Lock+Pick+Set?utm_term=ecs-auto-parts-advanced-lock-pick-set"><img alt="ecs-auto-parts-lock-repair-pick-set-17-tools-3-locks-and-1-visa-credit-card-pick-tool-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/ecs-auto-parts-lock-repair-pick-set-17-tools-3-locks-and-1-visa-credit-card-pick-tool-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When it comes to locksmith tools, this set from ECS Auto Parts offers a variety of options to choose from. I was surprised to find that it included not just the standard lock pick tools, but also a Visa credit card pick tool and even some extra locks for good measure. 

Right off the bat, I appreciated how compact this set was. It managed to pack 17 different tools and 3 transparent locks into a relatively small box. Not only does this make it convenient to carry around, but it also tells me that the company had a very clear idea of what kind of toolset was needed for this product. 

The quality of the tools was solid, with the stainless steel material adding durability and resistance to rust. It's a simple but effective feature that helps ensure this set will last quite a while. 

But, before you get too excited, it's important to understand that this may not be the most beginner-friendly set. It comes with a lot of tools and locks, and it might be overwhelming for someone just starting out in locksmithing. And while the individual tools were nicely designed and functional, trying to use all of them at once can be quite cumbersome. 

In summary, the ECS Auto Parts Lock Repair Pick Set is a great option for anyone who's been in the field for a while and needs a versatile set of tools. But if you're just starting out, you might want to look into a simpler, more basic starting kit to avoid being overwhelmed.
