### [HP OfficeJet Pro 8744 Ink Cartridge - High Yield Black](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Hp+952xl?utm\_term=hp-officejet-pro-8744-ink-cartridge-high-yield-black)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Hp+952xl?utm_term=hp-officejet-pro-8744-ink-cartridge-high-yield-black"><img alt="hp-officejet-pro-8744-ink-hp-952xl-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hp-officejet-pro-8744-ink-hp-952xl-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a regular user of the HP 952XL ink cartridge, I was blown away by its high-yield capacity and its exceptional performance in my daily printing tasks. The dark, bold black ink makes all my documents look professional and the vibrant colors stand out beautifully in my color projects. 

One thing that has always made me hesitant to use third-party ink cartridges is the compatibility issue with my HP printer. However, the HP 952XL worked seamlessly with my device, without any need for firmware updates or additional software. I was quite impressed with the product's reliability and ease of use. 

Since I started using these ink cartridges, I've noticed a significant improvement in my printer's performance. The crisp and clear print quality, along with the high yield, has made me very satisfied with my purchase. It's also worth mentioning that I appreciate the reasonable cost per page, making it a more affordable option for regular users. 

However, one drawback I've encountered is the short shelf life of these cartridges. With a recommended life of just 36 months, I quickly went through my initial stock and had to reorder several times within that period. While the print quality has been consistently excellent, I wish the shelf life was longer to minimize the need for frequent replacements. 

In conclusion, the HP 952XL ink cartridge is a great choice for those looking for high-yield, affordable, and compatible ink for their HP printer. The crisp print quality and reasonable cost per page outweigh the relatively short shelf life, and I would definitely recommend this product to others.

### [High Yield Ink Cartridge Replacement for HP 952XL](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Hp+952xl?utm\_term=high-yield-ink-cartridge-replacement-for-hp-952xl)

I recently had the opportunity to try these Inkjet Club compatible ink cartridges as a replacement for my HP 952XL high yield cartridges. Talk about convenience! Not only did they perfectly fit in my HP 952XL, but they also worked seamlessly with the latest firmware updates on my OfficeJet Pro 8710. 

The highlight of these cartridges for me was their high yield, offering me 825 pages of printing with just one cartridge. It's incredibly efficient, and I didn't have to worry about running out of ink halfway through my project. 

However, there was one small, slightly annoying, detail I noticed - these cartridges show no ink level by default. To my dismay, I once found myself clicking OK repeatedly on settings just to get the printer to acknowledge my cartridge. It's something I hope they address in future updates, but overall, it's a minor inconvenience. 

So, if you're looking for high-yield cartridges that fit your HP 952XL and work with the latest firmware updates, I'd definitely recommend these by Inkjet Club. Just be aware that you'll have to click OK on settings to tell the printer about your new cartridges.

When I first inserted the cartridge into my printer, I noticed how smooth and effortless the process was.
