Several years ago, I found myself in need of a product that I could use daily to keep my kitchen countertops looking fresh and shiny. That's when I discovered Parker & Bailey's Granite & Stone Cleaner. It was a game-changer for me because it's specifically designed for kitchen surfaces, leaving them looking spotless and smelling great. I found it effortlessly removes any residue or marks left behind by harsh household cleaners. 

One of the unique features that stands out to me is that the product is safe for food preparation areas. This means I can clean my kitchen countertops without worrying about cross-contamination, ensuring a clean and hygienic environment where I prepare meals. 

Another highlight for me is that this cleaner not only effectively removes dirt and stains from stone surfaces but also preserves and protects them. It's like getting two products in one! Regular use has helped extend the longevity and beauty of my countertops, giving them a natural glow. 

The generous size of the bottle is a bonus because it provides ample quantity for my daily cleaning needs. I love that it's made in Maine, USA, as it adds a sense of pride and trustworthiness to the product.

Overall, the Parker & Bailey Granite & Stone Cleaner has been a go-to product in my kitchen for years now. It's simple to use, highly effective, and has a generous quantity in each bottle.

When I first tried this Italian Craftsman Granite and Marble Polish, I was a bit skeptical. I had always relied on spray polishes for my marble countertops, but this creamy formula seemed promising. Boy, was I in for a treat!

Plus, it's safe to use on everything from wood furniture to sinks and countertops. 

The product is easy to use and has a pleasant aroma that disappears quickly, leaving no lingering scent. The only downside I encountered was with the packaging. One bottle I received arrived with the product leaking out, which created a bit of a mess. However, this issue seemed to be a one-time problem, and the product itself was definitely worth the inconvenience. 

In conclusion, the Italian Craftsman Granite and Marble Polish has become my go-to for maintaining all of my countertops and surfaces. Its ability to clean, polish, and protect in one step makes it a valuable addition to any household. The only improvement I'd suggest is to address the packaging issue, but overall, I highly recommend this product.

Despite the minor inconvenience, I would highly recommend this cleaner to anyone with marble or granite countertops looking for an effective, easy-to-use, and highly fragrant product. One more thing worth mentioning is that it's a great choice for those who value local products, as it's made in the USA.

Before making a purchase, it is essential to consider the type of product and its compatibility with your marble surfaces. There are mainly two types of Marble Cleaners: spray-bottle solutions and concentrated cleaners that require dilution in water. When choosing, consider factors such as ease of use, portability, and the amount of cleaner needed for the job. 


### Safety and Marble Protection

Marble is a delicate material that requires special care. Look for cleaners that are specifically designed for marble surfaces, as they will provide the best results without damaging the surface.

It contains a special formula that lifts and removes dirt, grease, and grime without damaging the marble.

### Can I use vinegar to clean my marble?

No, it is not recommended to use vinegar to clean your marble. Although vinegar is a popular natural cleaner, it can be too acidic for marble surfaces. Marble is a porous stone, and using vinegar can cause etching and discoloration. Granite and other stones can withstand acid, but marble is not as forgiving. Instead, use a cleaner that is specifically designed for marble or a neutral pH cleaner

that has undergone testing for use on marble surfaces. Make sure to read the label and follow the instructions for best results. It is also important to avoid using any abrasive materials on your marble, as this can scratch and damage the surface. Regular maintenance with a high-quality marble cleaner will help to keep your marble looking beautiful for years to come. 


### How often should I clean my marble?

It is recommended to clean your marble at least once a week to maintain its beauty. Marble surfaces can collect dirt, dust, and grime quickly, which can be difficult to remove once it has set in. Regular cleaning will help to prevent this from happening and keep your marble looking like new. If you have marble floors, you may need to clean them more frequently, depending on the level of traffic in your home. 

It is also important to avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials on your marble. These can damage the surface and cause etching or discoloration. Instead, use a cleaner that is specifically designed for marble or a neutral pH cleaner that has undergone testing for use on marble surfaces. Following these guidelines will help to extend the life of your marble and keep it looking beautiful. 


### Is marble resistant to water damage?

Marble is relatively resistant to water damage, but it is not completely impervious. Marble is a porous stone, and water can seep into the surface and cause damage if it is not properly sealed or maintained. Over time, water can cause staining or etching on the surface of the marble, which can be difficult to remove. It is important to seal your marble regularly and to clean up any spills or moisture as soon as possible. 

It is also a good idea to avoid using water-based cleaners or sealing products on your marble, as these can also damage the surface. Instead, use a cleaner or sealer that is specifically designed for marble surfaces. Following these guidelines will help to protect your marble from water damage and keep it looking like new. 


### What causes marble to discolor or etch?

Marble is a porous stone, which means that it is more prone to discoloration and etching than other types of stone. The main causes of discoloration and etching on marble surfaces are spills, water damage, and abrasive cleaning materials. Acids, such as lemon juice or vinegar, can also cause discoloration on marble surfaces, as they can etch the surface and leave streaks or residue. 

It is important to take proper care of your marble to prevent discoloration and etching. Avoid spills and clean up any moisture immediately. Use a cleaner or sealer that is specifically designed for marble surfaces, and always follow the manufacturer's instructions. Avoid using any abrasive materials on your marble, and avoid using water-based cleaners or sealing products. By following these guidelines, you can protect your marble from discoloration and etching and help it to maintain its beauty. 


### Can I use a steam cleaner on my marble floors?

No, it is not recommended to use a steam cleaner on your marble floors. While steam cleaning can be an effective way to clean many types of floors, it can be too harsh for marble surfaces. Marble is a porous stone, and the hot steam can cause damage to the surface, including discoloration, etching, and cracking. 

Instead, use a cleaner that is specifically designed for marble floors or a neutral pH cleaner that has undergone testing for use on marble surfaces. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for best results. Make sure to avoid using any abrasive materials or harsh chemicals on your marble floors, as these can also damage the surface. Regular maintenance with a high-quality marble cleaner will help to keep your marble floors looking beautiful for years to come.
