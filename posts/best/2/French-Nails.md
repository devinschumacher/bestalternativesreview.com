Last weekend, I decided to switch up my nail game and try out the Rave Nailz Pearled French Nailz in my favorite color - a bright, bold red. The set came with 24 nails, a range of sizes, nail glue, and even a nail file! 

As a fan of French tips, I was curious how the pearled French Nailz would differ. The oval-shaped, medium-length nails had a subtle pearl pattern on the accent nails, giving them a unique touch that I absolutely loved. The glossy finish on these fake nails is what really caught my attention, making them look more realistic than some I've tried before. 

Using these Pearled French Nailz was a breeze. The nail glue was easy to apply and the nails themselves were a great fit, not too tight but also not loose. My favorite part of this set was that they were functional, yet trendy - perfect for everyday wear.

They lasted a week before starting to peel off, which is a little disappointing compared to other sets I've tried. However, the quality of the materials and the unique design of the Pearled French Nailz make up for it. 

Overall, I'm really happy I decided to give these Rave Nailz a try. The Pearled French Nailz are a great addition to any nail enthusiast's collection, offering an eye-catching and functional option for everyday wear.

### What are French nails?

French nails are a type of artificial nail that originated in France. They are known for their oval shape and the pale, natural pink base that creates an elegant, classic look. These nails are usually made from gel or acrylic materials, and they can be applied in a variety of lengths to enhance the appearance of natural nails. 

One of the main advantages of French nails is that they can be easily maintained. Regular nail care, such as filing and buffing, can help extend the lifespan of the artificial nails. They also look very natural and are suitable for both casual and formal occasions, making them a popular choice among women of all ages. 


### What is the process of getting French nails?

Getting French nails typically involves a few steps, depending on whether you choose gel or acrylic nails. In both cases, the process generally begins with a nail technician preparing your natural nails for the application of the artificial nails. This may include cleaning and gently filing your nails to ensure a smooth, even surface. A protective base coat is then applied to protect your natural nails. 

Next, the artificial nails themselves are added. With acrylic nails, this usually involves mixing a liquid and a powder to create a nail-like consistency and then shaping and filing the nails to fit your fingers. With gel nails, a special gel solution is brushed onto your nails in thin layers. A UV lamp is then used to cure the gel and set it in place. The final step is to apply a topcoat to ensure a high gloss and durability.

### How long do French nails last?

The lifespan of French nails can vary depending on several factors, such as how well they are maintained and the type of artificial nail used (acrylic or gel). On average, good-quality French nails can last between 2 to 4 weeks without chipping or peeling. However, this can be affected by activities such as washing dishes, typing on a keyboard, or engaging in manual labor, which can cause damage to the artificial nails over time. 

To extend the lifespan of your French nails, it's essential to avoid using harsh chemicals, such as nail polish remover, and to minimize the amount of time your nails spend in water. Regularly washing your hands and moisturizing the skin around your nails can also help keep them looking their best for as long as possible. 


### Which nail type is better for French nails, gel or acrylic?

Both gel and acrylic French nails have their pros and cons, and the choice often comes down to personal preference and the desired outcome. Acrylic nails are known for their durability, as they are hardwearing and designed to last for several weeks. Gel nails, on the other hand, provide a more natural-looking finish and can be removed more easily without causing damage to the natural nails beneath. 

Gel nails also require less maintenance than acrylic nails. While they need to be cured under a UV lamp, they don't require any additional filing or trimming once they are applied. Additionally, gel nails can be easily repaired using clear base coat when they start to lift or grow out. In the end, the decision between gel and acrylic French nails depends on your specific preferences, budget, and desired level of maintenance.

### Can French nails be customized with different designs and patterns?

Yes, French nails can be customized with various designs and patterns to suit your personal style or the theme of an event you are attending. Nail technicians can create intricate designs, such as floral patterns, geometric shapes, or even images of famous landmarks, using a technique known as nail art. This can be done using special nail art tools, such as detailing brushes, or by freehand painting onto the wet gel or acrylic. 

Another popular option is to have French nails created with rhinestones, glitter, or other embellishments, giving them a more glamorous, eye-catching look. It's essential to communicate your preferences and ideas with your nail technician, as they can help you choose the right design and ensure that the finished product meets your expectations. 


### How much do French nails cost?

The cost of French nails can vary depending on several factors, such as the type of artificial nail used (gel or acrylic), the complexity of the design, the technician's expertise, and the location where the service is provided. On average, a set of French nails can range from $50 to $150 per application. However, prices might be higher or lower depending on the specific salon or nail technician. 

It's worth considering the quality of the materials used and the experience of the nail technician when making a decision on how much to invest in your French nails. Remember to have realistic expectations, considering that high-quality French nails may be more costly than less expensive options. It's also important to factor in the maintenance costs, such as refills or touch-ups, when thinking about the overall cost of these artificial nails.
