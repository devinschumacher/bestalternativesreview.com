### [Adidas Ultimate365 Recycled Polyester Golf Shorts](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Golf+Shorts?utm\_term=adidas-ultimate365-recycled-polyester-golf-shorts)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Golf+Shorts?utm_term=adidas-ultimate365-recycled-polyester-golf-shorts"><img alt="adidas-mens-ultimate365-8-5-inch-golf-shorts-lucid-fuchsia-30in-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/adidas-mens-ultimate365-8-5-inch-golf-shorts-lucid-fuchsia-30in-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried the Adidas Men's Ultimate365 golf shorts in the Lucid Fuchsia color, and I must say, I was blown away by their comfort and style. The 8.5-inch inseam seemed just right for my height and the regular fit with a mid-rise had a great fit around my waist. One of my favorite features was the stretch waist that accompanied the belt loops, making it incredibly easy to adjust my shirt while I played. 

The moisture-wicking fabric was a game-changer for me. As someone who tends to sweat a little during outdoor activities, these shorts kept me feeling dry and fresh all day long. The four-way stretch allowed for unrestricted movement, which was crucial when I was swinging my golf clubs. However, I did notice that the shorts didn't hold up well against rain or dew, but that's a small price to pay for the comfort and performance these shorts provided. 

One thing I wasn't too fond of was the water-repellent finish. It seemed like it made the shorts a bit more noticeable, especially when I had to walk on wet patches of grass. I'd have preferred a more subtle finish or perhaps something entirely different to enhance their performance. 

All in all, the Adidas Men's Ultimate365 golf shorts were a fantastic addition to my golfing experience. They were comfortable, stylish, and durable enough to withstand the demands of the golf course. 


### [Comfortable Golf Shorts with 5 Pockets and Wicking Fabric](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Golf+Shorts?utm\_term=comfortable-golf-shorts-with-5-pockets-and-wicking-fabric)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Golf+Shorts?utm_term=comfortable-golf-shorts-with-5-pockets-and-wicking-fabric"><img alt="callaway-stretch-performance-golf-short-with-media-pocket-peacoat-38-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/callaway-stretch-performance-golf-short-with-media-pocket-peacoat-38-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When I first tried on these Callaway Stretch Performance Golf Shorts, I knew I had found a winner. These shorts ticked all the boxes for comfort and style on the golf course, but also looked amazing in my regular daily attire. The unique 5 pocket styling made these shorts versatile, with two side pockets, two back pockets, and a media pocket perfect for holding my phone or additional essentials. 

One of the key features that stood out to me was the full elastic signature Callaway waistband, which allowed for a comfortable fit and seamless movement throughout the day. The 4-way stretch fabric made a significant difference in my range of motion, enabling me to make the perfect swing or line up my putt with ease. The moisture-wicking properties were also a lifesaver during those hot and humid rounds, keeping me dry and cool in the heat. 

Despite the fantastic quality and performance, I did encounter a minor issue with the waistband not keeping my shirt tucked in while playing golf. However, this could just be a personal preference and may not be a problem for others. 

Overall, these Callaway Golf Shorts have become a staple in my wardrobe for both work and play. Their comfort and style make them a perfect addition to any golfer's closet, and I can confidently say that they're worth every penny.

### [Dark Olive Green Abercrombie & Fitch Golf Shorts for Men](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Golf+Shorts?utm\_term=dark-olive-green-abercrombie-fitch-golf-shorts-for-men)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Golf+Shorts?utm_term=dark-olive-green-abercrombie-fitch-golf-shorts-for-men"><img alt="mens-performance-golf-short-in-dark-olive-green-size-38-abercrombie-fitch-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/mens-performance-golf-short-in-dark-olive-green-size-38-abercrombie-fitch-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on a pair of Men's Performance Golf Shorts from Abercrombie & Fitch, and let me tell you, they've been a game-changer for my outdoor activities. The Dark Olive Green pairs well with any top and keeps the look classy and chic. The 8-inch design is just enough to show off some leg without sacrificing mobility, perfect for golf and casual wear. 

One aspect I truly appreciate is its super breathable performance fabric, which guarantees all-day comfort. Despite its soft texture, the inner material is reinforced to protect against any damage from golf gadgets. The comfort-adaptive waistband and the button fly closure complete the list of thoughtful design elements this short possesses. 

However, the dark beige option does have a downside: the pattern of the material is more noticeable compared to the other colors. Also, the finishing of the fabric isn't the sleekest, which is something to consider while using them in different environments. 

All in all, I'd give these dark olive green shorts a solid 4.5 out of 5. The pros outweigh the cons with comfortable performance, versatility, and a stylish designâ€”a great addition to any golf enthusiast's wardrobe.

The Dri-Fit technology keeps moisture at bay, helping you stay fresh and comfortable even in the most challenging weather conditions. The fabric provides a subtle texture to prevent the shorts from clinging to your skin, ensuring a pleasant and hassle-free swing. 

A tacky waistband featuring the distinct Nike Golf graphic ensures your shirt remains tucked in securely while you bend and swing. The V-notch in the back of the waistband provides additional flexibility for a perfect fit. The 89% polyester and 11% elastane composition offer a great balance between comfort and durability, making these shorts an essential addition to your golf attire collection. 

While these shorts may fit well, beware of the shallow front pockets, which have been a common complaint among users. Be sure to mind what you stow in them, or you might end up losing more than just golf balls. With a total of 608 reviews and a rating of 4.6 out of 5, these shorts represent a delightful combination of style and performance for all golf enthusiasts.

I recently tried out the All in Motion Confident Khaki 38 men's golf shorts, and I have to say, they exceeded my expectations! These shorts are designed with 4-way stretch, allowing for ultimate comfort and flexibility during movement. But what truly stood out to me is their UPF 50+ rated material, which provides excellent UV protection to keep you safe in the sun. 

One of my favorite aspects of these shorts is the belt-loop waistband with a fly zipper closure, along with the zippered pocket and side and back pockets. They truly offer functional flair that not only looks great but also serves a purpose in everyday use. 

However, one thing I would like to point out is that the sizing might be a bit off, as some users reported that the shorts seemed to run slightly small. I would recommend going a size up or checking the sizing chart to ensure a perfect fit. Despite this minor issue, I highly recommend these golf shorts for their comfort, style, and excellent value for the price.

With a flat-front aesthetic, these shorts are perfect for those who appreciate a classic, modern look. 

Throughout my experience with these shorts, I've been impressed by their exceptional comfort, stretch, and water resistance. The stretch waistband ensures a perfect fit and prevents your shirt from riding up during your swing.

### [Under Armour Showdown Golf Shorts for Men - Gray 35](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Golf+Shorts?utm\_term=under-armour-showdown-golf-shorts-for-men-gray-35)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Golf+Shorts?utm_term=under-armour-showdown-golf-shorts-for-men-gray-35"><img alt="under-armour-mens-showdown-golf-shorts-gray-36" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/under-armour-mens-showdown-golf-shorts-gray-36/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Walter Hagen Light Mint Golf Shorts Size 35](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Golf+Shorts?utm\_term=walter-hagen-light-mint-golf-shorts-size-35)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Golf+Shorts?utm_term=walter-hagen-light-mint-golf-shorts-size-35"><img alt="walter-hagen-mens-perfect-11-golf-shorts-size-35-light-mint-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/walter-hagen-mens-perfect-11-golf-shorts-size-35-light-mint-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Walter Hagen Men's Perfect 11 Golf Shorts in size 35 Light Mint, and I have to say, they were quite a game changer for me. I've always been a fan of lightweight, breathable shorts, especially on hot summer days, and these did not disappoint. 

One of the standout features was the moisture-wicking technology. It was a hot and humid day when I decided to take these for a spin, and I was quite thrilled to discover that my skin stayed pleasantly cool the entire time. The Hydro-Dri technology helped keep me comfortable even when the sun was beating down relentlessly. 

Another positive aspect was the stretch in these shorts. As someone who likes to move around on the golf course - and, frankly, in any situation - I appreciated the flexibility they offered. The four-way stretch fabric allowed me a full range of motion and made my movements feel natural and effortless. 

The shorts were also easy to maintain. I could simply toss them in the washing machine, which was a major plus for someone like me who tends to have a busy schedule. They emerged from the laundry cycle looking just as fresh as they did when I first put them on. 

As much as I loved these shorts, there was one downside I couldn't overlook - the sizing. While I usually wear a size 35, I found that these shorts fit a bit snugly around the waist. I had to size up to make sure they didn't feel too tight on me. It's a bummer because I was initially excited to find a snug-fitting, yet comfortable, pair of golf shorts. 

Overall, these Walter Hagen Men's Perfect 11 Golf Shorts were a pleasant surprise for me. The moisture-wicking technology, four-way stretch, and effortless maintenance made them a delight to wear. But the snug fit around the waist was a small letdown. If you're looking for golf shorts that offer comfort and ease of movement, these may be worth your consideration.

The multi-pocket design was also a nice touch, giving me plenty of storage options for my phone, keys, and cards. 

On the slightly negative side, I did notice that they run a bit smaller than expected. I had to order a size larger than usual, but that didn't affect the overall fit and comfort. The color options were also a bit limited, but that's a minor complaint considering the quality of the product. 

In summary, these CRZ Yoga men's golf shorts are a great investment for anyone looking for comfortable, high-quality golf shorts. They're perfect for golf, casual wear, and work, and I've been very pleased with my purchase. 


## Buyer's Guide

When it comes to golfing, comfort is just as important as style. Golf shorts provide the perfect balance between these two aspects. In this buyer's guide, we'll discuss some crucial features to consider when purchasing golf shorts, offer general advice to make an informed decision, and help you find the right pair for your needs. 


### Material and Moisture-Wicking Properties

Look for golf shorts made of lightweight, breathable materials such as polyester, nylon, or a blend of both. These fabrics are designed to wick away moisture, keeping you dry and comfortable during long rounds of golf. Check the label to ensure that the shorts are made from quick-drying material, which is helpful when you spend time on the course or in the rain. 


### Fit and Comfort

The fit of your golf shorts is essential for comfort and performance. A well-fitting pair of shorts should not be too tight or too loose, allowing for a full range of motion while swinging. Look for golf shorts that have an elastic waistband, as this will provide a comfortable and snug fit. Additionally, consider the length of the shorts, as longer or shorter styles may suit your personal preference. 


### Pockets and Storage

Golf shorts with additional pockets can come in handy for carrying small items like balls, tees, or scorecards. Look for shorts with at least one or two secure pockets for storing essentials. Some golf shorts even feature built-in garner loops, helping you keep your gloves and other accessories within easy reach. 


### UV Protection and Sun Resistance

Since you'll be spending hours under the sun, it's essential to choose golf shorts with UV protection or sun-resistant properties. This will help prevent sunburn and protect your skin from harmful UV rays. Look for a UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor) rating on the product label, with a rating of 30 or higher being ideal.
