### [Black+decker Spillbuster Portable Carpet Cleaner for On-the-Go Mess Cleaning](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Mini+Carpet+Cleaner?utm\_term=blackdecker-spillbuster-portable-carpet-cleaner-for-on-the-go-mess-cleaning)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Mini+Carpet+Cleaner?utm_term=blackdecker-spillbuster-portable-carpet-cleaner-for-on-the-go-mess-cleaning"><img alt="blackdecker-spillbuster-portable-carpet-cleaner-handheld-bhsb315jf-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackdecker-spillbuster-portable-carpet-cleaner-handheld-bhsb315jf-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Black+decker Spillbuster Portable Carpet Cleaner, a cordless and portable design, makes cleaning multiple surfaces a breeze. With a simple 3-step cleaning process, users can effectively eliminate stains and messes. This powerful suction machine features a rechargeable battery that provides the necessary runtime for any task. 

Despite its strong points, the Black+decker Spillbuster Portable Carpet Cleaner is not without its drawbacks. Some users have reported poor suction and easy clogging. The machine, unfortunately, does not perform well in removing trash, leaving some customers unsatisfied with their purchase. Overall, this carpet cleaner might be a bit of a hit and miss, depending on individual needs and expectations. 


### [Portable Carpet Cleaner: Bissell Pet Stain Cordless Eraser (3180)](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Mini+Carpet+Cleaner?utm\_term=portable-carpet-cleaner-bissell-pet-stain-cordless-eraser-3180)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Mini+Carpet+Cleaner?utm_term=portable-carpet-cleaner-bissell-pet-stain-cordless-eraser-3180"><img alt="bissell-pet-stain-eraser-cordless-portable-carpet-cleaner-3181" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bissell-pet-stain-eraser-cordless-portable-carpet-cleaner-3181/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a pet owner, I've been there - dealing with those unexpected pet messes. And if you're anything like me, you know that quick, easy cleanup is the key to maintaining your sanity. That's where Bissell's Pet Stain Eraser comes in handy. This little powerhouse is the perfect tool to tackle those inevitable messes in a snap. 

The first thing that struck me was how lightweight it was - even with its built-in battery, it barely felt like I was carrying anything. With a 3.3-pound design, it's a breeze to maneuver around the house, and the 7.2V lithium-ion battery makes it easy to grab and go whenever needed. 

But what really sets this portable carpet cleaner apart is its ability to remove tough pet stains. The OXY formula included in the package, which stores right in the machine, works wonders on pesky stains, lifting them up and leaving your carpets looking as good as new. No need to worry about mixing water and cleaner here. The fact that no water is required also makes cleanup a breeze - just empty the tank when it's full. 

Of course, no product is without its cons, and the Pet Stain Eraser was no exception. The suction may not be as powerful as some full-sized carpet cleaners, but for the size of the cleaner, it gets the job done. The small tank size does mean you'll need to empty and refill it frequently, but again, for a small device, it's a manageable drawback. 

In terms of craftsmanship, the Bissell Pet Stain Eraser is a solid choice. It's easy to assemble and takes minimal effort to store away when not in use. One downside is its noise level, which can be a bit louder than expected, but given the small size of the cleaner, it's not too surprising. 

Overall, the Bissell Pet Stain Eraser is a handy tool for pet owners looking for a quick, easy-to-use solution to those inevitable pet messes. Its lightweight design, powerful stain-removing capabilities, and convenient no-water formula make it a worthwhile addition to any pet owner's arsenal, even if it isn't perfect. 


### [Bissell Little Green Proheat Portable Carpet Cleaner for Stain Removal](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Mini+Carpet+Cleaner?utm\_term=bissell-little-green-proheat-portable-carpet-cleaner-for-stain-removal)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Mini+Carpet+Cleaner?utm_term=bissell-little-green-proheat-portable-carpet-cleaner-for-stain-removal"><img alt="bissell-little-green-proheat-portable-carpet-cleaner-5207g-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bissell-little-green-proheat-portable-carpet-cleaner-5207g-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Bissell Little Green Proheat Portable Carpet Cleaner and let me tell you, it's a game-changer for spot and stain removal. Whether it's tough stains on hard-to-reach areas like stairs or everyday grime on upholstery, this little machine does it all. 

The Lightweight Compact Design is a lifesaver for those of us with limited storage space. No more tripping over bulky machines when trying to navigate around the house. The easy-to-use Deep Cleaning Tool and Tough Stain Tool make quick work of the most stubborn spots, while the 3-in-1 Stair Tool helps us tackle those pesky corners and treads on our carpeted staircases. 

While I love the powerful suction and heat wave technology that keeps the water temperature consistent throughout the cleaning process, I wish the power cord was longer. It's a minor inconvenience, but nothing that can't be overcome by using an extension cord. 

All in all, the Bissell Little Green Proheat Portable Carpet Cleaner is well worth the investment. It's a reliable and efficient tool that makes cleaning a breeze, especially when dealing with unexpected messes. Highly recommended! 


### [BISSELL SpotClean Proheat Portable Carpet Cleaner for Stain Removal](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Mini+Carpet+Cleaner?utm\_term=bissell-spotclean-proheat-portable-carpet-cleaner-for-stain-removal)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Mini+Carpet+Cleaner?utm_term=bissell-spotclean-proheat-portable-carpet-cleaner-for-stain-removal"><img alt="bissell-spotclean-proheat-portable-spot-and-stain-carpet-cleaner-2694-blue-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bissell-spotclean-proheat-portable-spot-and-stain-carpet-cleaner-2694-blue-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Using the Bissell SpotClean ProHeat is like having a superhero in the room, ready to take on the most challenging stains and spot cleaning tasks. The built-in HeatWave Technology was certainly a game-changer, ensuring even the most stubborn stains were a thing of the past. 

One thing that stood out to me was just how versatile it was. Whether I had to tackle dirt on stairs or grime on carpets, this little machine was always up for the challenge. Its lightweight design made it a breeze to maneuver, and the fact that it's easy to store away when not in use was a nice added bonus. 

However, there were a couple of not-so-pleasant surprises. For starters, while this spot cleaner is powerful, it required a good amount of elbow grease to really get the job done. I found myself putting in a bit more effort than I would have liked to ensure the spot was thoroughly cleaned. 

Secondly, the hose and water chambers seemed to be built with a little less durability in mind. I had to use caution and take extra care to avoid any issues or damage, which felt a tad inconvenient. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, overall, I'm happy with the Bissell SpotClean ProHeat. It's a handy tool to have in the house for those unexpected messes, and its ease of use and storage made it a great addition to my cleaning arsenal.

### [Bissell SpotClean Pet Pro Mini Carpet Cleaner](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Mini+Carpet+Cleaner?utm\_term=bissell-spotclean-pet-pro-mini-carpet-cleaner)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Mini+Carpet+Cleaner?utm_term=bissell-spotclean-pet-pro-mini-carpet-cleaner"><img alt="bissell-2458-spotclean-pet-pro-portable-carpet-cleaner-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bissell-2458-spotclean-pet-pro-portable-carpet-cleaner-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Using the Bissell SpotClean Pro Pet carpet cleaner has been a lifesaver, particularly for pet owners. This portable cleaner comes with powerful suction and an effective cleaning solution that easily tackles stubborn stains and pet messes. The compact design makes it easy to maneuver, and the long power cord is convenient for reaching those tough-to-reach spots. What's even more impressive is that it doesn't only work on carpets—it's also great for upholstery, stairs, and area rugs! 

One of the standout features for me was its large capacity 3/4 gallon tank. It means less frequent emptying and refilling, making the cleaning process more efficient. You can easily clean a larger area without the hassle of constantly stopping to refill the tank. The versatile cleaning experience is further enhanced by the inclusion of pet tools, such as the Stain Trapper Tool and the Tough Stain Tool, perfect for dealing with those pesky pet stains. 

However, there were some minor drawbacks that I found while using this product. The noise levels can be quite high, almost too loud to have a conversation while using it. It might be a bit of a challenge for those who suffer from hearing problems or live in apartments close to each other. On the plus side, the noise level is expected considering the suction and cleaning power it delivers. 

In terms of the overall design and construction, the Bissell SpotClean Pro Pet seems well-built and sturdy. It's easy to put together and doesn't require any assembly. Despite its weight, the handle provides a comfortable grip, making it easy to carry around. However, the hose length could be longer to make reaching those hard-to-reach spots even easier. 

One of the pet-friendly features that I appreciated was the presence of a trial-size BISSELL Professional Pet Urine Eliminator + Oxy. It ensured that I got the best results possible when cleaning up pet stains. While it's not included in the purchase, the fact that it comes with a pet-specific cleaning solution makes this cleaner a great choice for pet owners. 

In conclusion, the Bissell SpotClean Pro Pet has been an invaluable addition to my cleaning routine. Its powerful suction, effective cleaning solution, and convenient design make it a truly versatile and practical choice. Although there are some minor drawbacks such as noise levels and the hose length, these did not detract significantly from my overall experience. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a reliable and efficient carpet cleaner, especially those with pets.

### [Bissell Little Green Portable Mini Carpet Cleaner](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Mini+Carpet+Cleaner?utm\_term=bissell-little-green-portable-mini-carpet-cleaner)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Mini+Carpet+Cleaner?utm_term=bissell-little-green-portable-mini-carpet-cleaner"><img alt="bissell-little-green-proheat-portable-carpet-cleaner-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bissell-little-green-proheat-portable-carpet-cleaner-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Bissell Little Green Proheat portable carpet cleaner, and despite hearing great things about it, I found myself a tad disappointed. On the bright side, I must say that this little cleaner did a fantastic job at suctioning up dirt and some pet messes around the house. It's lightweight and easy to use- perfect for those pesky last-minute carpet disasters. 

However, I experienced a few drawbacks. The first one was the lack of heating or any significant warmth in the water. I honestly don't even know why "Proheat" is in the name because the water temperature was lukewarm at best. It did the job, but I was expecting better from a product that boasts its heating capabilities. 

What I loved about this machine was its ease in reaching tight spaces, and the hose and attachments neatly storage solution. I was able to reach and clean up some tricky corners easily without breaking a sweat. 

One glaring downside was how noisy it was. I thought I'd be able to catch up on some of my favorite TV shows while using this little cleaner, but the constant humming made it an impractical option. 

Lastly, I had some concerns about durability. A few of the parts felt fragile and poorly made, leaving me worried about the long-term usage. This wasn't a deal-breaker, but it's something I'll keep an eye on as time goes on. 

In conclusion, the Bissell Little Green Proheat portable carpet cleaner did a great job on the cleaning part, but fell short on the heating aspect and noise levels. It's a useful tool, but it could use a little improvement to make it a truly outstanding addition to your cleaning arsenal.
