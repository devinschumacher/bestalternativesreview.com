### [Purple Venom Big Kids Michael Jordan Jersey](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Michael+Jordan+Jersey?utm\_term=purple-venom-big-kids-michael-jordan-jersey)

However, there's a slight downside to this jersey. Even though it's made of 100% polyester knit mesh fabric, it's not the best choice for a long washing session. It tends to pill a bit, and the colors might start to fade after a few washes. But overall, it's a pretty solid jersey for the price, and it's definitely worth checking out if you're looking for something to wear during your next basketball game or just in your daily life.

### What is the history behind Michael Jordan wearing the number 23?

Michael Jordan wearing the number 23 is deeply rooted in his basketball career and personal life. Before joining the Chicago Bulls in 1984, Jordan wore the number 25 during his time at the University of North Carolina. However, the number 23 was already taken by his teammate, James Worthy, who later wore the number during his time with the Los Angeles Lakers. 

When Jordan joined the Bulls, he wanted to keep his original number, but at the time, the number 25 was taken by a teammate named Cliff Levingston. After some negotiations, Jordan decided to switch to the number 45, which he wore during his rookie season in 1984. The following year, Jordan changed his jersey number to 23 to honor his Tar Heel days and pay homage to his former teammate James Worthy, who had switched to the number 32 with the Lakers.
