However, one downside I faced was that the colors seemed to fade slightly during the washing process. Also, the fabric did not hold up well when subjected to heavy use, like in a daily-worn tote bag. Nonetheless, the overall experience was enjoyable and the fabric's beauty made it worth the minor drawbacks.
