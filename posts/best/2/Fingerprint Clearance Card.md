### What's the Purpose of a Fingerprint Clearance Card?

A Fingerprint Clearance Card serves as a vital document that verifies an individual's eligibility for employment or volunteer work in roles requiring a thorough criminal history background check. It is issued by the state where the individual resides and consists of their unique fingerprint-based criminal history information. Employers and organizations rely on this card to screen potential job applicants and volunteers, ensuring a workforce that is safe and trustworthy.

Three different types of Fingerprint Clearance Cards exist, each with a varying degree of scrutiny, making them suitable for various types of jobs. The most thorough option is Level 3, which is commonly required for sensitive roles or positions dealing with children.


### How Can I Get My Hands on a Fingerprint Clearance Card?

To obtain a Fingerprint Clearance Card, follow these steps: 
1. Visit your state's Bureau of Investigation or Department of Public Safety website to understand the requirements and application process. Some states mandate an online background check with fingerprint submission electronically, while others require visiting their office in person for the fingerprinting process. 2. Provide your fingerprints, personal information, and pay a processing fee. 3. After the background check is complete and your fingerprints have been processed, your Fingerprint Clearance Card will be mailed to you.

The acquisition process may vary by state, so consult your state's website for specific instructions and guidelines before proceeding. Remember that your Fingerprint Clearance Card expires after a specific period (usually 1-3 years), so check the expiration date before applying.

### Do I Need a Fingerprint Clearance Card for Every Job or Volunteer Gig?

A Fingerprint Clearance Card is not a necessity for every job or volunteer role. The requirement for a clearance card depends on the job's nature. Some roles do not demand a background check and, consequently, do not necessitate a Fingerprint Clearance Card. It is up to the employer or organization to decide which types of positions require background checks, and consequently, a Fingerprint Clearance Card. Always check with each employer or organization where you intend to work or volunteer to determine their specific requirements.

However, having a Fingerprint Clearance Card can significantly increase your chances of being hired for positions working with children or other vulnerable populations, as employers and organizations prioritize the safety and well-being of their clients or workers.


### Can a Fingerprint Clearance Card Be Denied?

Although it is unusual, a Fingerprint Clearance Card can be denied. This may occur if the applicant has a criminal history that disqualifies them from working in specific jobs or if their background check reveals information that does not meet the employer or organization's requirements. 

If your Fingerprint Clearance Card application is rejected, discuss the reasons with the employer or organization and consider seeking alternative job opportunities where the clearance requirements may be less stringent. If you believe there is an error or the decision is incorrect, you may be able to appeal the decision. Addressing any concerns or issues directly with the employer or your state's Bureau of Investigation and Public Safety is essential.

Contact your state's Bureau of Investigation or Department of Public Safety for specific guidelines on how to renew or reapply for a new card.


### Is It Pricey to Get a Fingerprint Clearance Card?
