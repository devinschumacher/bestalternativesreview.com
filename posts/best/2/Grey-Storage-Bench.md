For storage bins or compartments in grey storage benches, clean them with warm water and mild soap. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials as they can damage the surface or finish. Regular maintenance and cleaning will help your grey storage bench maintain its appearance and functionality for years to come.
