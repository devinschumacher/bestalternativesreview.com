### [Revlon Sky Pink Super Lustrous Lip Gloss](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Lip+Gloss?utm\_term=revlon-sky-pink-super-lustrous-lip-gloss)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Lip+Gloss?utm_term=revlon-sky-pink-super-lustrous-lip-gloss"><img alt="revlon-super-lustrous-lip-gloss-sky-pink-207-0-13-fl-oz-tube-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/revlon-super-lustrous-lip-gloss-sky-pink-207-0-13-fl-oz-tube-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried the Revlon Super Lustrous Lip Gloss in the shade Sky Pink, and let me tell you, this product did not disappoint. The applicator offers a pleasant experience with its soft and cushiony design, easily coating my lips in a sheer layer of gloss without being sticky or tacky. 

What stood out to me the most was the moisturizing aspect of the formula. The gloss left my lips feeling soft and supple, giving them a natural, healthy-looking glow. The color payoff was also impressive, providing a delicate, sheer tint that was perfect for everyday wear. 

One thing I noticed was that the gloss was quite long-lasting for a lip product. It stayed on my lips throughout the day without needing constant reapplication. However, I did find that it was quite difficult to remove, especially when paired with my usual cleansing routine. 

In terms of the scent and taste, I was pleased to find that they were both pleasantly subtle, making the lip gloss a comfortable choice to wear. The weight of the product was also comfortable and unobtrusive, allowing me to wear it for extended periods without feeling weighed down. 

Overall, I believe the Revlon Super Lustrous Lip Gloss to be a high-quality product that offers both comfort and style. While I did encounter a few minor drawbacks, the overall experience was positive, and I would happily recommend this to others looking for a versatile lip gloss option. 


### [Florence by Mills Mellow Mills Lip Gloss](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Lip+Gloss?utm\_term=florence-by-mills-mellow-mills-lip-gloss)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Lip+Gloss?utm_term=florence-by-mills-mellow-mills-lip-gloss"><img alt="florence-by-mills-get-glossed-lip-gloss-mellow-mills-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/florence-by-mills-get-glossed-lip-gloss-mellow-mills-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Florence by Mills Get Glossed Lip Gloss, otherwise known as Mellow Mills, has become a go-to for me during my makeup routine. The lightweight and non-sticky formula made it a breeze to apply, and the luscious, high-shine coat of pigment provided an effortless pop of color. The sheer, glossy finish was a welcome change from the cloying stickiness often found in lip glosses, and the formula went on smoothly without weighing my lips down. 

What stood out most during my experience with this product was the comfortable, non-sticky formula, as well as its moisturizing properties. The inclusion of shea butter and vitamin E ensured my lips felt cared for while wearing it, and the addition of castor seed oil provided an extra boost of moisture for dry lips. This attention to detail and focus on skincare benefits made a lasting impression on me. 

However, the one downside that I encountered was the lip gloss's wearability, as it didn't last as long as I hoped. Even though it felt light and comfortable on my lips, it seemed to disappear after a few hours, requiring me to reapply more frequently than I would have liked. Still, the positives outweighed the negatives for me, and I'll continue to reach for Mellow Mills on days when a touch of gloss and a boost of shine are just what I need. 


### [Neutrogena Hydro Boost Lip Shine: Hydrating Non-Sticky Gloss in Soft Blush](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Lip+Gloss?utm\_term=neutrogena-hydro-boost-lip-shine-hydrating-non-sticky-gloss-in-soft-blush)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Lip+Gloss?utm_term=neutrogena-hydro-boost-lip-shine-hydrating-non-sticky-gloss-in-soft-blush"><img alt="neutrogena-hydro-boost-hydrating-lip-shine-soft-blush-10-0-10-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/neutrogena-hydro-boost-hydrating-lip-shine-soft-blush-10-0-10-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

With Neutrogena's Hydro Boost Hydrating Lip Shine, I found a perfect blend of color, shine, and hydrating lip balm in one small but mighty tube. It's amazing how the product doesn't stick to your lips or leave behind a gritty residue, which is a relief for those of us who can't stand the stickiness of some lip products. 

One thing I must say, though, is that it's not the easiest to remove if you want to take it off at the end of the day. I've had to scrub a bit to get all traces off, but it's no biggie. And as for the scent, it's a pleasant, neutral one that fades away quickly, so it won't be a bother for people who are sensitive to strong fragrances. 

Now, the part I can't be quiet about is the Hydro Boost's impact on dry lips. It's a lifesaver! After applying, my lips felt like they were bathed in velvet, and the hyaluronic acid worked its magic, leaving my lips moisturized and plump. It's not just a lip gloss; it's a full-on lip treatment! 

Overall, this is a fantastic product in terms of application, color, and hydration. The only downside is the removal process and the potential for drying out your wallet with multiple purchases - but trust me, it's worth it! 


### [Fenty Beauty Gloss Bomb Paraben-Free Lip Luminizer](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Lip+Gloss?utm\_term=fenty-beauty-gloss-bomb-paraben-free-lip-luminizer)

I recently tried the Fenty Beauty Gloss Bomb Universal Lip Luminizer in the shade "Fu$$y" and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by this product. The packaging is sleek and beautiful, with a rose gold cap and a clear tube that you can easily see the product color through. The applicator is a curved wand that hugs the lips for easy and precise application. 

One swipe of this gloss and my lips instantly looked fuller and smoother, thanks to its non-sticky yet super shiny formula. I loved the addictive peach-vanilla scent that came with it, but what really stood out to me was its long-lasting effect. It stayed on my lips for hours without any reapplication needed. 

The moisturizing effect was also a highlight, as it left my lips feeling soft and hydrated. However, I did find the removal process to be a bit challenging, as it took more effort than usual. Additionally, some users mentioned that it can feel drying on the lips after a while. 

Overall, this lip gloss delivers on its promise of providing high-shine lip gloss with conditioning shea butter. It's an excellent addition to any makeup lover's arsenal, especially for those seeking a non-sticky alternative. Just be prepared for the occasional drying effect and a bit of a challenge when removing it.

Recently, I had the pleasure of trying out Lancôme's Juicy Tubes Miracle lip gloss. As a beauty enthusiast, I was drawn to its appealing finish and lasting hydration. I must say, I wasn't disappointed. The gloss provided the perfect balance of shine and hydration, making my lips feel lusciously juicy and cushioned. The wide range of flavors and finishes was another plus, allowing me to experiment with different looks. 

However, one downside I encountered was the occasional stickiness that came with the gloss. While it didn't bother me too much, I can see how some may find it off-putting. Additionally, the product's packaging could use a redesign for better portability and ease of use. 

Despite these minor cons, Juicy Tubes Miracle remains a must-have in my makeup collection. Its combination of color, shine, and hydration has elevated my lip routine, and I eagerly anticipate trying out more of the brand's offerings.

### [Too Faced Deluxe Lip Injection Extreme Lip Plumper for Fuller Lips](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Lip+Gloss?utm\_term=too-faced-deluxe-lip-injection-extreme-lip-plumper-for-fuller-lips)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Lip+Gloss?utm_term=too-faced-deluxe-lip-injection-extreme-lip-plumper-for-fuller-lips"><img alt="too-faced-deluxe-lip-injection-extreme-lip-plumper-lip-gloss-0-05-oz-tube-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/too-faced-deluxe-lip-injection-extreme-lip-plumper-lip-gloss-0-05-oz-tube-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Despite these drawbacks, the Too Faced Deluxe Lip Injection Extreme receives high praise for its effective plumping, ease of application, and pleasant scent.

### [Makeup Revolution Juicy Pout Grapefruit Lip Gloss](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Lip+Gloss?utm\_term=makeup-revolution-juicy-pout-grapefruit-lip-gloss)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Lip+Gloss?utm_term=makeup-revolution-juicy-pout-grapefruit-lip-gloss"><img alt="makeup-revolution-juicy-pout-lip-gloss-grapefruit-0-15-fl-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/makeup-revolution-juicy-pout-lip-gloss-grapefruit-0-15-fl-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Last weekend, I tried out the Makeup Revolution Juicy Pout Lip Gloss in Grapefruit. My first impression was that the scent was quite unique – not your typical sweet or floral aroma, but a refreshing zesty aroma, just like real grapefruit! The consistency was a lovely high-shine, wet-look glaze, leaving my lips looking smooth and shiny without feeling sticky. 

However, I noticed that it wasn't as hydrating as I hoped, and the color seemed to fade quite quickly. All in all, it's a great everyday lip gloss for those on a budget, with a yummy scent, and a smooth application, but be prepared to have to reapply it more frequently than you might with a pricier option. 


### [Honest Beauty Gloss-C Pink Agate Lip Gloss](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Lip+Gloss?utm\_term=honest-beauty-gloss-c-pink-agate-lip-gloss)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Lip+Gloss?utm_term=honest-beauty-gloss-c-pink-agate-lip-gloss"><img alt="honest-beauty-gloss-c-lip-gloss-pink-agate-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/honest-beauty-gloss-c-lip-gloss-pink-agate-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [High Shine Clear Lip Gloss](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Lip+Gloss?utm\_term=high-shine-clear-lip-gloss)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Lip+Gloss?utm_term=high-shine-clear-lip-gloss"><img alt="la-colors-high-shine-lipgloss-clear-1-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/la-colors-high-shine-lipgloss-clear-1-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Luxurious Lip Gloss by Pat McGrath Labs - Divine Rose Edition](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Lip+Gloss?utm\_term=luxurious-lip-gloss-by-pat-mcgrath-labs-divine-rose-edition)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Lip+Gloss?utm_term=luxurious-lip-gloss-by-pat-mcgrath-labs-divine-rose-edition"><img alt="pat-mcgrath-labs-lust-lip-gloss-divine-rose-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/pat-mcgrath-labs-lust-lip-gloss-divine-rose-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Pat McGrath Labs Lust: Divine Rose Lip Gloss is an exquisite product that brings a luxurious touch to your daily beauty routine. The minute I swipe it on, I'm greeted by a mesmerizing, ethereally erotic shade and the surreally seductive shine of a glossy balm. The applicator is chunky and slightly curved, making it easy to pick up just the right amount of product and apply it with precision. What sets this gloss apart is its ability to both deliver a high-shine finish and provide a comfortable feel on the lips—it's not sticky at all, yet it manages to give my lips a beautiful, glossy shine that enhances their natural beauty. 

The shade I've been using, Bronze Divinity, is a beautiful, sheer neutral color with a hint of sparkle. It glides on effortlessly, leaving my lips looking fuller and smoother—a look I've come to love. Furthermore, I've found that it pairs well with other lip products, like lipstick or lip liner. The formula is moisturizing, and while it's not overly sticky, it does last for several hours without needing retouching. 

One downside I've noticed is that the pigmentation can be inconsistent. The shades I own range from strong, bold colors that look incredible on to sheer shades that require a bit more work to build up the color. However, overall, I've been very pleased with the performance of this lip gloss, and it has become a staple in my makeup routine. While it may be a bit on the pricey side, I believe the quality and luxurious feel are well worth the investment for those who appreciate a sophisticated lip gloss experience. 


### [Essence Extreme Shine Volume Lipgloss: Pink Pretty Edition](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Lip+Gloss?utm\_term=essence-extreme-shine-volume-lipgloss-pink-pretty-edition)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Lip+Gloss?utm_term=essence-extreme-shine-volume-lipgloss-pink-pretty-edition"><img alt="essence-extreme-shine-volume-lipgloss-103-pretty-in-pink-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/essence-extreme-shine-volume-lipgloss-103-pretty-in-pink-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Essence Extreme Shine Volume lip gloss is perfect for those who want a shiny, soft, and voluminous look. It has a flock applicator that makes precise application a breeze, and it comes in a 5 ml tube with a capacity of 5 ml. 

The formula is transparent but offers an irresistible wet-look effect that lasts for hours. This lip gloss can be used with various make-up looks, from natural daytime to colorful summer ones, or elegant evening make-up. It is perfect for touch-ups on the go. 

However, some users have reported the consistency to be a bit gritty due to the glitter and found the applicator to absorb too much product, leading to a mess. Additionally, its lasting power may not be as long as expected, especially after eating or drinking. 

Overall, the Essence Extreme Shine Volume lip gloss offers a shiny, wet-look finish with a convenient applicator, but it might not be the best choice for those looking for a long-lasting glossy effect. 


### [Kiko Milano Hydra Lipgloss - 03 Shimmering Shade](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Lip+Gloss?utm\_term=kiko-milano-hydra-lipgloss-03-shimmering-shade)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Lip+Gloss?utm_term=kiko-milano-hydra-lipgloss-03-shimmering-shade"><img alt="kiko-milano-3d-hydra-lipgloss-4" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/kiko-milano-3d-hydra-lipgloss-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

During my recent beauty haul, I stumbled upon the Kiko Milano 3D Hydra Lipgloss in the shade 03 Golden Peach. The name alone had me intrigued, so I decided to give it a try. 

Upon first application, I was pleasantly surprised by the soft and sensory texture of the lipgloss. It effortlessly glided across my lips, leaving them feeling smooth and bright. The shade itself is a stunning golden peach with a hint of pink, adding a subtle shimmer to my lips. 

The 3D effect of the lipgloss is quite impressive, as it not only enhances the color of my lips but also gives them a plump and juicy appearance. The formula does not stick to my lips; instead, it provides a comfortable wear that lasts for several hours. 

One of the notable highlights of this lipgloss is its inclusion of Bidens extract, which helps to nourish and protect my lips. I appreciate that it's dermatologically tested and non-comedogenic, ensuring that my skin remains comfortable and healthy while using it. 

While I enjoy the overall experience of using the Kiko Milano 3D Hydra Lipgloss, I do find that it's a bit on the pricier side when compared to other lipglosses in the market. Additionally, the wand could be a bit more precise, making it harder to apply the product around the corners of my lips. 

Overall, I'm quite satisfied with my experience using the Kiko Milano 3D Hydra Lipgloss in shade 03 Golden Peach. The soft texture, nourishing formula, and stunning shimmer make it a worthwhile addition to my beauty routine. 


### [Maybelline Lifter Lip Gloss](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Lip+Gloss?utm\_term=maybelline-lifter-lip-gloss)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Lip+Gloss?utm_term=maybelline-lifter-lip-gloss"><img alt="maybelline-lifter-lip-gloss-with-hyaluronic-acid-petal-0-18-fl-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/maybelline-lifter-lip-gloss-with-hyaluronic-acid-petal-0-18-fl-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

After dabbling in different beauty products for years, I recently discovered the Maybelline Lifter Lip Gloss with Hyaluronic Acid. The warm pink with copper pearl shade caught my eye, and I was curious to see how it would impact the look of my lips. 

From the moment I applied this gloss, I could tell it stood out in a good way. The hyaluronic acid formula helped boost the hydration in my lips, and the tint gave a subtle shimmer that complemented my overall makeup look. The gloss itself was non-sticky and had a delightful scent that wasn't overpowering. 

What I loved most about this product was the wand applicator. It offered smooth and precise application that made it easy to evenly distribute the gloss across my lips. The lip plumping sensation was a nice perk, providing a subtle lift for a fuller appearance. 

However, one minor con I noticed was that it didn't last all day, as I sometimes had to reapply it during the day. But overall, the Maybelline Lifter Lip Gloss with Hyaluronic Acid has definitely earned its place in my beauty routine. Its hydrating and plumping properties have proven to enhance my lip's overall appearance, and I'll continue using it in the future. 


### [Glossier Glassy: High-Shine Red Lip Gloss (3.5 ml)](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Lip+Gloss?utm\_term=glossier-glassy-high-shine-red-lip-gloss-3-5-ml)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Lip+Gloss?utm_term=glossier-glassy-high-shine-red-lip-gloss-3-5-ml"><img alt="glossier-glassy-high-shine-lip-gloss-red-3-5-ml-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/glossier-glassy-high-shine-lip-gloss-red-3-5-ml-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried the Glossier Glassy High-Shine Lip Gloss, and my experience was a mixed bag. On one hand, I loved the glossy, high-shine finish it gave to my lips. The color was vibrant and eye-catching, which is always a bonus for me. 

However, I must say, I was not a fan of the stickiness. Despite the claim of a cushiony, moisturized finish, the gloss seemed to cling to my lips in a way that felt uncomfortable. It was difficult to remove and left a sticky residue, which is not something I appreciate in a lip product. 

One of the standout features of this gloss was the long-lasting shine. The Gloss-Lock Technology really did its job, and my lips looked glossy for hours. But I must admit, I was not a fan of the way the product seemed to settle in the tube. It felt like the formula had changed, and it didn't feel the same as before. 

In the end, while I did appreciate the beautiful shade and the long-lasting shine, I couldn't get past the stickiness and the change in formula. I would recommend trying a different lip product if you're looking for something more comfortable and easier to work with.

The Fenty Beauty Gloss Bomb Universal Lip Luminizer is a truly remarkable product. With its long-lasting formula, it's perfect for daily use, providing a beautiful shine that feels as good as it looks. 

The non-sticky texture ensures a comfortable wear, while the conditioning Shea butter leaves lips feeling softer and smoother. The peach-vanilla scent is an added bonus, making this gloss a delightful experience. 

Its cruelty-free status appeals to conscious consumers, and its versatility means it can be worn for any occasion. However, some users might find the price a bit high for a lip gloss.

When I first tried the Stila Beauty Boss Lip Gloss, I was instantly drawn to the iridescent pearl pigments that created a stunning shimmery effect on my lips. The luminous oils added a natural glow and made my lips feel incredibly soft and supple. However, I soon noticed that it was quite sticky and a bit difficult to remove.

However, there were a few downsides to this product. For one, I found the scent to be a bit overwhelming, which made me hesitant to wear it in public. Additionally, the gloss stuck to my teeth, which was a bit of an inconvenience. 

Overall, the Stila Beauty Boss Lip Gloss is a beautiful and luxurious product that adds a touch of glamour to any look. While it may not be the most convenient or practical option for daily use, it's perfect for special occasions or when you want to make a statement.
