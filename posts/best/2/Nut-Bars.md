<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Nut+Bars?utm_term=healthy-almond-cookie-nut-bars-convenient-vegan-and-gluten-free-snacking"><img alt="larabar-fruit-nut-bar-almond-cookie-16-pack-1-6-oz-bars-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/larabar-fruit-nut-bar-almond-cookie-16-pack-1-6-oz-bars-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out Larabar's fruit and nut bar in the Almond Cookie flavor, and let me tell you - it was a delightful snack option for my busy lifestyle. These bars are made from only the healthiest and simplest ingredients, including almonds, dates, apples, and a touch of almond extract and sea salt. It's vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free, and non-GMO, making it a perfect choice for those who want to indulge in something sweet without compromising their dietary preferences. 

The Almond Cookie Larabar is the perfect size for on-the-go snacking, with conveniently wrapped bars that can easily fit into my purse or gym bag. I found this bar to be a delicious and satisfying mid-morning or afternoon snack, providing me with the energy I needed to power through my day. The combination of almonds, dates, and apple in the bar gave it a unique and delectable flavor that I couldn't get enough of. 

However, there were a few drawbacks to this product. Some people might find the texture a bit strange, as it's quite chewy and doesn't have the same crunchy consistency as traditional cookie bars. Additionally, a few reviewers mentioned that they wouldn't buy it again due to the flavor not being quite to their liking. 

Overall, though, I enjoyed my experience with the Larabar Almond Cookie fruit and nut bar. It was a tasty and healthy snack option, providing me with an energy boost without compromising my dietary goals. I would definitely recommend giving it a try for those looking for a simple, indulgent treat that's also good for you.

I recently tried the Larabar Cashew Cookie bars, and let me tell you, they were quite the experience. I have to admit, at first glance, the brown color of the bar didn't seem too appealing. Some commenters even thought the bar might be moldy due to the color! Turns out, the cashews and dates used in the bar are the natural color that dates come in, and, as a result, the bars do have a brown appearance. 

It's always refreshing to find a snack that's vegan, and this Larabar fits the bill. I loved that it was gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free, and had no added sugars.
