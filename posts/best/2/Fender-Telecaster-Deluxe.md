<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Fender+Telecaster+Deluxe?utm_term=vintage-nostalgia-fender-70s-telecaster-deluxe-with-tremolo-in-white"><img alt="fender-vintera-ii-70s-telecaster-deluxe-with-tremolo-vintage-white-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fender-vintera-ii-70s-telecaster-deluxe-with-tremolo-vintage-white-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When I first picked up the Fender Vintera II '70s Telecaster Deluxe, I was immediately drawn to its sleek vintage aesthetic. This guitar has a classic alder body with a glossy polyester finish, which gives it a timeless feel. 

As I began to play, the '70s U-shaped maple neck felt incredibly comfortable in my hand. The neck is adorned with vintage-style black dot inlays that provide a striking contrast against the white finish. 

One feature I loved was the vintage-style wide-range humbucking pickups. These puppies deliver a rich, warm sound that can be fine-tuned with the two volume and tone controls, as well as the 3-position toggle switch. 

The guitar's tremolo system, featuring vintage-style synchronized tremolo and tuning screws, worked smoothly and precisely. It made string changes and tuning a breeze. 

While I appreciated the many aspects of this guitar, there was one drawback that I noticed: it lacked some of the modern features that I've grown used to, such as locking tuners or coil-split switches. 

Overall, the Fender Vintera II '70s Telecaster Deluxe with Tremolo is a great choice for those who value vintage style and performance. It offers a unique experience, transporting you back to the golden age of rock music with its vintage design and powerful sound. 


### [Fender American Vintage II 1975 Telecaster Deluxe Black - Authentic 70s Design](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Fender+Telecaster+Deluxe?utm\_term=fender-american-vintage-ii-1975-telecaster-deluxe-black-authentic-70s-design)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Fender+Telecaster+Deluxe?utm_term=fender-american-vintage-ii-1975-telecaster-deluxe-black-authentic-70s-design"><img alt="fender-american-vintage-ii-1975-telecaster-deluxe-black-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fender-american-vintage-ii-1975-telecaster-deluxe-black-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using this black Fender American Vintage II 1975 Telecaster Deluxe in my daily life, and I have to say it's a really fun and versatile guitar. The gloss polyurethane finish looks great and gives it a nice, smooth feel. I love the authentic CuNiFe wide-range humbucking pickups, they have a warm and punchy sound when cranked up, yet still retain that classic Fender sparkle. 

I've had a few Telecaster-style guitars before, but this one has a really comfortable '75 C-shaped neck profile that's perfect for my hands. The maple construction and 7.25" fingerboard radius make for a really responsive and dynamic playing experience. The string-through body design with stainless steel block saddles and Pure Vintage Tele Deluxe tuners keep everything nice and tight, even when I'm really digging into a riff. 

However, there are a few minor things I'd like to mention. The bullet truss rod and 3 bolt neck plate give it that classic 70s feel, but I wish the truss rod adjustment was a bit more intuitive. And while the vintage style black hardshell case is a nice touch, I wish it had a bit more padding to protect the guitar from bumps and falls. 

Overall, this Fender American Vintage II 1975 Telecaster Deluxe is a fantastic guitar that combines classic design with modern playability. If you're a fan of Telecasters and want a guitar that can do it all, this one is definitely worth checking out.

As a devoted blues aficionado and a proud owner of the Fender Kingfish Telecaster Deluxe Mississippi Night, I've come to truly appreciate this guitar's ability to breathe life into the soul of modern blues music. The roasted maple neck, with its "V" shape and satin finish, exudes a comfortable, yet refined feel in hand, while the slab rosewood fingerboard adds a touch of authenticity. 

Fitted with two specially voiced humbuckers, this guitar blends seamlessly with distortions, delivering a smooth, light output that captures the essence of the blues. The Adjusto-Matic bridge and anchored tailpiece keep everything secure, while the alder body sports a stunning Mississippi Night finish that leaves you captivated. 

While the Kingfish Telecaster Deluxe may boast of its signature blues sound, I've found it to be an incredibly versatile instrument, delivering a range of tones that extends well beyond the realm of blues. From tight modern pop-punk to 90s crunch overdrive, the guitar's versatility has allowed me to explore various music genres and create unique soundscapes.

However, as with any instrument, perfection isn't always guaranteed. While this Fender is a delight to play and looks the part, it might not be ideal for everyone.

Growing up, I always had a soft spot for Telecasters, but I never got around to owning one. So, when the opportunity came up to review the Fender Deluxe in a "Maple - White Blonde" finish, I knew I had to try one out. 

This guitar has a striking appearance and the finish looks like it was lovingly crafted with an artist's touch. It's a beauty to behold, really. The Noiseless pickups are a fantastic feature, creating a bright and clear sound that I really appreciate, especially when playing through my amp. 

However, there's one thing that I found really annoying - the neck. It's a bit too wide for my liking, and I found it a bit harder to navigate than I'm used to with my other guitars. 

But overall, the Fender Nashville Telecaster Deluxe is a brilliant guitar. It's perfect for those who want a little extra something in their sound, without sacrificing the classic Telecaster design. For me, it was a pleasure to use, even with its minor flaw. I'm sure many other musicians will feel the same once they give it a try.

### [Fender American Professional II Telecaster Deluxe Electric Guitar - Olympic White Maple Fingerboard](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Fender+Telecaster+Deluxe?utm\_term=fender-american-professional-ii-telecaster-deluxe-electric-guitar-olympic-white-maple-fingerboard)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Fender+Telecaster+Deluxe?utm_term=fender-american-professional-ii-telecaster-deluxe-electric-guitar-olympic-white-maple-fingerboard"><img alt="fender-american-professional-ii-telecaster-deluxe-maple-olympic-white-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fender-american-professional-ii-telecaster-deluxe-maple-olympic-white-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

A little while ago, I purchased an American Professional II Telecaster Deluxe from Fender. The first thing that caught my eye was its Olympic White finish, which added a modern and sleek touch to the classic Telecaster style. But don't be fooled â€“ this is no ordinary guitar. Hidden under the gloss urethane finish are some powerful features that make this axe stand out from the rest. 

When I put my hands on its deep C-shaped neck, I realized the true comfort this guitar had to offer. Its maple body, coupled with a maple fingerboard, delivered a rich resonance and attack that I found delightful. The truss rod was easy to adjust, and the bolt-on joint provided a solid foundation for my playing. 

The 22 frets glided smoothly beneath my fingers, and the bone nut held the strings in place without causing any unwanted buzz. The pickups had a distinctive sound that ranged from the sweet singing of single coils to the chunky growl of humbuckers. And the 3-way pickup switch made it easy to switch between those two worlds. 

While the guitar had a few signs of use â€“ like the picking marks on the pickguard and a bit of fogging on the metal parts â€“ these imperfections didn't detract from the overall experience. After all, I believe that a well-loved and well-used instrument often has a more soulful and expressive character. 

The only downside of the Fender American Professional II Telecaster Deluxe is that setting it up to perfection requires a bit of extra effort and fine-tuning. But once you've achieved the optimal intonation and action, this guitar is truly a dream come true for any music enthusiast. It's been a pleasure to have this versatile and beautiful instrument with me on my daily musical journey. 


### [Squier Affinity Series Burgundy Mist Telecaster Deluxe Guitar - 21 Frets, HH Pickups](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Fender+Telecaster+Deluxe?utm\_term=squier-affinity-series-burgundy-mist-telecaster-deluxe-guitar-21-frets-hh-pickups)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Fender+Telecaster+Deluxe?utm_term=squier-affinity-series-burgundy-mist-telecaster-deluxe-guitar-21-frets-hh-pickups"><img alt="squier-affinity-series-burgundy-mist-telecaster-deluxe-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/squier-affinity-series-burgundy-mist-telecaster-deluxe-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

If you're a fan of Fender Telecasters and want a burgundy mist beauty to add to your collection, look no further than the Squier Affinity Burgundy Mist Telecaster Deluxe. This guitar delivers in terms of looks, playability, and tone, so let me share my experience with it. 

As soon as I unboxed this guitar, I was taken aback by its vibrant burgundy mist finish. It's not just a pretty face, though; this instrument is designed to work as well as it looks. The poplar body, combined with a comfortable C shape maple neck and a laurel 21 fret fingerboard, creates a guitar that's a joy to play. 

What sets this Telecaster Deluxe apart from others are the two Fender ceramic humbuckers. Each pickup has a designated volume and tone control, giving you the authentic Tele sound â€“ bright and full. And the versatility of this guitar doesn't stop there; it's popular among musicians from country to rock and worship, making it a great choice for any genre. 

One thing I noticed when playing was the machine heads color. While it might seem like a minor detail, it does add a touch of class to an already stunning guitar. And speaking of class, the "used" stamp and new serial number on the headstock only adds to the unique character of this instrument. 

Now, no product is perfect, and the Affinity Telecaster Deluxe is no exception. The hardware finish is decent, but not top-of-the-line. Additionally, the poplar body is a bit thinner than a standard Fender, which might not appeal to everyone. But these are minor complaints when considering the overall package. 

In conclusion, the Squier Affinity Burgundy Mist Telecaster Deluxe is a stunning instrument that offers versatility, playability, and a unique look. [If you're a fan of Telecasters or just looking for a guitar with a fresh, distinctive appearance, this might be the perfect choice for you.](https://gist.github.com/janeknowsbest77/5b030d91f4a92914316083a5e96744bc)

### [Fender Telecaster Deluxe Shawbucker - Sonic Gray - Rosewood Electric Guitar](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Fender+Telecaster+Deluxe?utm\_term=fender-telecaster-deluxe-shawbucker-sonic-gray-rosewood-electric-guitar)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Fender+Telecaster+Deluxe?utm_term=fender-telecaster-deluxe-shawbucker-sonic-gray-rosewood-electric-guitar"><img alt="fender-american-professional-telecaster-deluxe-shawbucker-sonic-gray-rosewood-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fender-american-professional-telecaster-deluxe-shawbucker-sonic-gray-rosewood-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've always been a fan of the Fender Telecaster, but honestly, it took a lot of trial and error to find the one that really spoke to me. This American Professional Telecaster Deluxe ShawBucker in Sonic Gray is a game changer for me. The "Deep C"-shaped neck profile is just right, and those narrow-tall frets make bending strings a dream come true. It's impressive how the pair of warm ShawBucker pickups can produce so many nuanced tones, truly fitting for the modern player. 

Sure, I've encountered a few issues with slightly inconsistent components, but overall, it just feels right. And let's not forget the treble-bleed circuit that keeps my tones clear and sparkling.

### [Fender Deluxe Nashville Telecaster Maple Honey Blonde](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Fender+Telecaster+Deluxe?utm\_term=fender-deluxe-nashville-telecaster-maple-honey-blonde)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Fender+Telecaster+Deluxe?utm_term=fender-deluxe-nashville-telecaster-maple-honey-blonde"><img alt="fender-deluxe-nashville-tele-maple-honey-blonde-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fender-deluxe-nashville-tele-maple-honey-blonde-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a passionate guitarist, I recently discovered the Fender Deluxe Nashville Tele and couldn't be more thrilled. The moment I opened the gig bag, I was struck by the guitar's impeccable condition, and the Fender brand gig bag just added to the overall appeal. 

One of the most unique features of this guitar is the combination of a Tex-Mex Stratocaster pickup with two Tex-Mex Telecaster pickups. With the five-way Strat-o-Tone switching, this guitar offers an incredible range of versatility that is not commonly found in other Telecaster models. The ash or alder body, paired with the maple or rosewood fingerboard, adds a touch of class and sophistication to this instrument. 

When it comes to the hardware, the vintage-style tuners are a delight to work with, and the vintage-style six-saddle bridge provides a solid foundation for the guitar's sound. However, the bridge and saddles are a bit flimsy, which might bother some players. Though this is a minor issue, I decided to replace the entire bridge plate assembly with a high-quality aftermarket one to ensure better performance. 

Setting up this guitar was a bit of a challenge initially, but once I got it dialed in, the results were nothing short of amazing. The hot Tex-Mex pickups have strong magnets, so they required lowering, but once I found the perfect settings, the guitar produced a rich, full sound that was truly impressive. The neck, though narrower than I was used to, grew on me after some practice. 

The weight of this guitar is noticeable, being heavier than my Strats, but I've come to appreciate its ability to sustain better. The gig bag that comes with the guitar is a nice touch and provides a secure way to transport the instrument. 

In conclusion, the Fender Deluxe Nashville Tele is a must-have for any serious guitarist looking for a versatile and sophisticated instrument. While there are a few minor drawbacks, such as the flimsy bridge and saddles, the overall experience is well worth the investment.
