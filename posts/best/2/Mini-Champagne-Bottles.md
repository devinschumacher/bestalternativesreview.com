Tried out 5 different champagne varieties in a double-blind taste test with some friends - Freixenet was the cheapest, at $15 for a two pack, and it was up against champagnes that were up to $200 per bottle. Ended up being my second favorite, right after the $60 bottle of Billecart-Salmon. Blew the $200 bottle out of the water! Great bubbles, great smell, great flavor. Definitely my go-to champagne from now on. 

I love this wine! Sent this as a gift to a family member. So easy, I found exactly the wine I wanted and in the size. I placed the order online. I received confirmation of my order and the order was shipped and my cousin received the 4 small bottles of Freixenets in a few days. She loved the wine. I loved how efficient the gift process was, I shopped from the comfort of my home for a gift to be sent on the other side of the country. 

Was so well packaged, not only in a box but each bottle was individually covered. I just wish shipping was a little less expensive but worth it. It takes a little while for delivery. 

The mini bottles are exactly what I needed, and are as pictured. They came very quickly. And the packaging was phenomenal! I plan to order more. The perfect. Great customer service. 

We love this; great taste and not sweet. 

I love this wine store! We are having a birthday party for our daughter and the best wine shop came to the rescue! Thank you sooo much! 

Was so well packaged not only in a box but each bottle was individually covered. I just wish shipping was a little less expensive but worth it. It takes a little while for delivery.

We ordered a large number of these for our company's holiday party, and they arrived expertly packaged, so that not a single one was damaged. The product itself is great, as we already knew, but the customer service at this company is BAR none! 

Packaged well, and right on time!

When it comes to celebrating special occasions, mini champagne bottles are a classic choice. These small bottles offer the same authentic taste and experience as their full-sized counterparts, but in a more compact and affordable package. In this buyer's guide, we will discuss important features to consider when purchasing mini champagne bottles, as well as general advice for selecting and using them. 


### Size

Size is one of the most vital factors to consider when buying mini champagne bottles. The most common size for mini bottles is 8.45 fluid ounces (250 ml), which is about a quarter of the size of a standard champagne bottle. However, you may also find 3-ounce (90 ml) or 6-ounce (180 ml) bottles available in the market. Make sure to choose the size that best suits your needs and occasion.

### Shape

Mini champagne bottles come in various shapes, including cylindrical, square, or even novelty shapes like stars or hearts. The cylindrical shape is the most classic and widely available, while novelty shapes may be more difficult to find and could be more expensive. Consider the decor or theme of your event when choosing the bottle shape that best fits the occasion. 


### Cap Type

Mini champagne bottles typically have two types of caps: a foil cap or a cork cap. Foil-capped bottles are more common and easier to find, while cork-capped bottles provide a more traditional champagne experience. If you prefer a more authentic champagne experience, look for cork-capped bottles. [However, note that cork-capped bottles may require a special opener.](https://gist.github.com/janeknowsbest77/f376f3e19b29c4f3ad31a92bcb69b90d)

Plastic bottles are sturdier, but may not have the same level of sophistication. Consider the event and atmosphere when choosing the material and design that best suits your needs.

### What are good places to purchase mini champagne bottles?

Mini champagne bottles can be found at various retailers and online stores. Some popular options include: Amazon, Walmart, Target, and local liquor stores. Specialty stores that cater to events and party supplies may also carry mini champagne bottles. You can also find high-quality mini champagne bottles at specialty websites that focus on unique and elegant party decorations and accessories. 

When shopping for mini champagne bottles, consider reading reviews and comparing prices to ensure you're getting the best quality product at a fair price. You can also check for any discounts or promotions offered by the retailer to save even more money on your purchase. Finally, don't forget to consider shipping and handling fees, as this can significantly impact the overall cost of your order. 


### Can mini champagne bottles be refilled or reused?

Yes, mini champagne bottles can be refilled or reused, depending on the type of bottle. Many mini champagne bottles on the market are made of glass or plastic, and some can be refilled multiple times as long as the sealing mechanism remains intact and the bottle is cleaned properly between uses. However, some plastic bottles may not be refillable due to the material and design of the cap. 

If you plan to reuse your mini champagne bottles, it's essential to follow proper cleaning and storage procedures to ensure their longevity. You should also consider whether refilling the bottle is safe in terms of potential contaminants or spoilage of the contents. For example, reusing a bottle that already contains champagne for a non-alcoholic beverage like fruit juice may lead to spoilage or contamination of the juice.

### How do I properly store mini champagne bottles?

Proper storage of mini champagne bottles is essential for their longevity and safety. To ensure their quality, you should store them in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight or heat sources. A wine cellar or refrigerator is an ideal storage solution, as it maintains a consistent temperature and humidity level. 

If you plan to store your mini champagne bottles for an extended period, make sure to keep them upright in a protective container or box, such as a wine rack or case. This helps to prevent the cork from drying out and becoming brittle, which can lead to a leak or spoilage of the contents. Proper storage is just as important for mini champagne bottles as it is for their larger counterparts, so be sure to take the necessary precautions to protect your investment.
