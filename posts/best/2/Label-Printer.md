### [Brother Versatile Color Printer for Photos](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Label+Printer?utm\_term=brother-versatile-color-printer-for-photos)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Label+Printer?utm_term=brother-versatile-color-printer-for-photos"><img alt="brother-versatile-compact-vc-500w-wireless-color-label-and-photo-printer-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/brother-versatile-compact-vc-500w-wireless-color-label-and-photo-printer-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried the compact Brother Versatile Compact VC-500W color label and photo printer, and let me tell you, it was pretty cool to play with. 

The wireless networking feature was really impressive. I could create and print labels from my phone, which was such a convenient way to make custom name tags, stickers, or even quick-and-easy holiday photo invites. The printer's ZINK Zero Ink technology made things more interesting as it eliminated the need for ink cartridges, ribbons, or toners completely. Plus, the paper is infused with all the colors needed for printing high-quality photos, which was a big plus for me. 

The label design software, Touch Editor, was also a delight. It gave me a lot of freedom to create the perfect label for my workplace. The built-in clipart, symbols, and frames were fantastic additions to the app, giving me a ton of options to decorate and personalize my prints. 

However, there were a couple of things I felt could be improved. The printer's performance was pretty inconsistent, sometimes giving me really bright and vibrant prints, while at other times, the colors would look really dull and faded. The size of the label was a bit of an issue too, as it was too limited for my liking. I would have loved to see some more options when it came to sizing. 

Moreover, the printer's sturdiness surprised me a little. It turned out to be a bit delicate, especially when it came to handling the labels and the manual cutting mechanism. The paper rolls required for the printer were a bit expensive compared to what I anticipated, considering the printer's price point. 

But, overall, the Brother Versatile Compact VC-500W printer was a good experience, and I would definitely recommend it if you're looking for a colorful way to jazz up your labels and photo prints.
