### [Summer Beach Women's Sundress - Light Blue, Maxi with Pockets](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Light+Blue+Sundress?utm\_term=summer-beach-womens-sundress-light-blue-maxi-with-pockets)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Light+Blue+Sundress?utm_term=summer-beach-womens-sundress-light-blue-maxi-with-pockets"><img alt="themogan-womens-casual-loose-sundress-sleeveless-split-maxi-dresses-summer-beach-long-dress-w-pocket-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/themogan-womens-casual-loose-sundress-sleeveless-split-maxi-dresses-summer-beach-long-dress-w-pocket-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently stumbled upon the Themogan Women's Casual Loose Sundress, and I must say, it has quickly become a staple in my summer wardrobe. The breezy baby blue color is simply delightful and the perfect shade to blend in with the warm sunny weather. 

The standout feature of this dress is its loose fit, which allows for a comfortable and effortless wearing experience. It's like wearing a warm hug on a summer day, and I appreciate how it drapes around my body without being too clingy. 

Another plus is the addition of pockets. It's always a pleasant surprise when clothing items come with added storage! I've found pockets are incredibly handy when I'm at the beach or on a walk, allowing me to conveniently store my keys, phone or sunscreen without the need for an additional bag. 

However, one downside I noticed was that the fabric seemed rather thin and stretchy. While it does provide a comfortable fit, it may also contribute to the dress losing its shape after a few wears. Additionally, I found the original length to be slightly too long for my preference, and required some alterations to shorten it further. 

Despite these minor setbacks, this Baby Blue Sundress has become my go-to summer dress for casual outings. It's a blend of comfort and style that allows me to feel fabulous while embracing the warm weather. 


### [Petal & Pup Cinna Midi Dress - Light Blue Sundress](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Light+Blue+Sundress?utm\_term=petal-pup-cinna-midi-dress-light-blue-sundress)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Light+Blue+Sundress?utm_term=petal-pup-cinna-midi-dress-light-blue-sundress"><img alt="petal-pup-cinna-one-shoulder-midi-dress-light-blue-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/petal-pup-cinna-one-shoulder-midi-dress-light-blue-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Being a stylish individual, I was immediately drawn to the Light Blue Sundress from Petal & Pup's Cinna One Shoulder Midi Dress line. The asymmetrical neckline perfectly showcased one of my favorite features, while the ruching on the sides added an elegant touch to complete the whole look. What truly stood out to me, though, was the invisible side zip. No more awkward moments when getting dressed! 

However, my experience wasn't entirely perfect. The size I ordered was a bit too small, despite following the size chart closely. Although I'm a size 6, the small still felt tight, making me have to exchange it for a larger size. In the end, the dress fit comfortably, but it was clear that the sizing was not consistent. 

Still, I have to say that the dress itself was beautifully made and caught everyone's eye at my most recent event. Its midi length was just right, and the full lining made it very comfortable to wear. The light blue color was a breath of fresh air, a great alternative to the usual summer pastels.

### [ASOS Design Light Blue Midi Sundress, Size 14 US](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Light+Blue+Sundress?utm\_term=asos-design-light-blue-midi-sundress-size-14-us)

While some users have reported that the cut of the dress is not the most flattering, others have expressed satisfaction with its quality and appearance. Overall, the dress might be a bit of a hit or miss, but it's definitely worth giving it a try.

### [Jump Light Blue Sundress with Sleeves and Neck Ties](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Light+Blue+Sundress?utm\_term=jump-light-blue-sundress-with-sleeves-and-neck-ties)

I couldn't help but feel like a princess as I slipped into the dress, and the soft, stretchy jersey-knit fabric made it incredibly comfortable to wear. 

As I walked around in the dress, I noticed that the glitter could be a bit distracting, as it seemed to be constantly falling off and sticking to my skin and clothes.

However, I appreciated the variety of sizes available, including XL, which made it a great option for those of us with different body types.
