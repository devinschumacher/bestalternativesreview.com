<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Matouk+Bedding?utm_term=matouk-embroidered-percale-duvet-covers"><img alt="atoll-sham-matouk-wedgwood-king-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/atoll-sham-matouk-wedgwood-king-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Matouk Duma Diamond Duvet Cover: King-Size Dune Luxury](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Matouk+Bedding?utm\_term=matouk-duma-diamond-duvet-cover-king-size-dune-luxury)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Matouk+Bedding?utm_term=matouk-duma-diamond-duvet-cover-king-size-dune-luxury"><img alt="matouk-duma-diamond-duvet-cover-king-dune-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/matouk-duma-diamond-duvet-cover-king-dune-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the pleasure of trying out the Matouk Duma Diamond Duvet Cover in the Dune colorway for my bedroom. The painstaking attention to detail in this Schumacher design was immediately apparent to me. The classic harlequin pattern with its expressive brushstrokes added a sophisticated touch to my sleeping space. 

This duvet cover is made from 500 thread count Luca Egyptian cotton percale, giving it an unrivaled softness and luxurious feel. I loved the vibrant colors, which looked even more stunning in person. The geometric pattern was versatile enough to work with various prints and solids, but it shined on its own. 

One aspect of the duvet that I really appreciated was its OEKO-TEX Standard 100 certification. As someone who is conscious about the environment, I felt great knowing that this product was produced in an environmentally friendly manner. 

However, I did notice that the duvet cover was slightly heavier and stiffer than the cotton percale covers I had used previously. It took a bit more effort to tuck in the corner ties, but overall, I still found the experience pleasing. 

In summary, the Matouk Duma Diamond Duvet Cover has become a treasured addition to my bedroom, thanks to its elegant and versatile design, high-quality materials, and environmentally friendly production. While it has its drawbacks, such as its heavier weight, these minor issues do not detract significantly from the product's appeal.

As a fan of cozy, high-quality bedding, I was excited to give the Matouk Sierra Hemstitch Duvet Cover a try. The product description assured me it was a casual yet stylish addition to my bedding collection. Made with 350-thread count long-staple cotton percale and constructed from fabric sourced in India, this duvet cover was designed to provide both comfort and durability. 

One aspect that really stood out to me was the subtle hemstitch detail, adding a touch of elegance to my setup without being overly intrusive. However, I also noticed a slight downside â€“ the sizing seemed to be slightly off, leaving way too much excess fabric on my king-sized mattress. 

Despite this minor issue, I appreciated that the product was made in the USA and that all Matouk fabrics are OEKO-TEX Standard 100 certified, ensuring top-quality materials and environmentally-friendly production practices. Upon reading other user reviews, it seems that the Matouk Sierra Hemstitch Duvet Cover has been well-received by many, praising its comfort and attention to detail.

### [Matouk Chatham Waffle Cotton King Blanket - Portuguese Craftsmanship](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Matouk+Bedding?utm\_term=matouk-chatham-waffle-cotton-king-blanket-portuguese-craftsmanship)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Matouk+Bedding?utm_term=matouk-chatham-waffle-cotton-king-blanket-portuguese-craftsmanship"><img alt="matouk-chatham-blanket-king-silver-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/matouk-chatham-blanket-king-silver-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Hands down, the Matouk Chatham Blanket King is the coziest and lightest waffle-weave cotton blanket I've ever wrapped myself in. Crafted in Portugal with 100% cotton, you can count on its ethereal warmth without dealing with heavy, suffocating fabrics. I used to struggle with finding a summer blanket that didn't cling to me, but with this Matouk wonder, I found the balance I've been searching for. 

Everything about itâ€”from the color selection to the designâ€”seemed tailored to my taste. After my first wash, the vibrancy of the colors stood out even more, and the weave felt so soft and airy that it didn't pull against my skin. 

One thing that stood out for me, though, was the care instructions. Be prepared for a delicate dance with your washing machine, avoiding bleach, and tumbling only in the lowest heat possible to protect this precious piece. 

However, I've read some reviews from others who didn't have such a smooth experience. A few reported thread pulls and noticed some signs of wear after a short time. I hope this review offers a balanced perspective on the Matouk Chatham Blanket King. It's a beautiful addition to my bed that I'm glad to have, but it may not suit everyone's specific needs or washing habits.

I recently had the chance to try out the Matouk Diamond Pique ivory twin coverlet, and it was quite a delightful experience. Just like a perfect white shirt, this coverlet brings a touch of class to any bedroom in any color. The diamond pattern is classic, and it adds a sense of timelessness without making the space feel dated. 

One of the things that stood out to me was the quality of the fabric. The tag boasts that it's made from 60% cotton and 40% polyester, which is a great blend because it's soft and easy to care for. The fact that it's made in the USA made me feel more confident in its durability. It's perfect for a summer night, thanks to its lightweight, non-quilted construction. 

However, there were a couple of negative aspects as well. Firstly, I found the color a bit of a letdown. While the description calls it 'Ivory', the actual color was more like a pale lemon. This was a little surprising, but it wasn't a deal-breaker. Secondly, I had high hopes for some embroidery, but instead, the coverlet was finished with just one stitched white trim. This was rather disappointing, as the descriptions promised an 'embroidered scallop'. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I still highly recommend the Matouk Diamond Pique ivory twin coverlet. Its charm, comfort, and timeless design make it a worthwhile addition to any bedroom. Keep in mind, though, that it might be too thin for some, and the color isn't quite as described. 


### [Matouk Sierra King Sheet Set in Ivory | Luxury Bedding Collection](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Matouk+Bedding?utm\_term=matouk-sierra-king-sheet-set-in-ivory-luxury-bedding-collection)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Matouk+Bedding?utm_term=matouk-sierra-king-sheet-set-in-ivory-luxury-bedding-collection"><img alt="matouk-sierra-king-fitted-sheet-ivory-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/matouk-sierra-king-fitted-sheet-ivory-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried the Matouk Sierra king fitted sheet in ivory and it totally exceeded my expectations. The 17" pocket size was perfect for my mattress, providing a snug yet comfortable fit. The 350 thread count long staple cotton percale made the sheet super soft and breathable, making it ideal for hot summer nights. 

While the Matouk Sierra is made in the USA using fabric from India, I noticed the materials had a hint of roughness to them when I first received them. However, after a few washes, the sheets softened up and the roughness disappeared. 

One thing I loved about these sheets is that they don't wrinkle easily. After washing them and drying on low heat, they were easy to iron as needed. Plus, they're OEKO-TEX Standard 100 certified, which means they're environmentally friendly and safe for you and the planet! 

One downside I noticed was that the king fitted sheet is quite large, so if you have a smaller mattress, it might not fit as well as I hoped. But overall, I'm thrilled with my experience using the Matouk Sierra sheet and would definitely recommend it to others who are looking for high-quality bedding.

### [Matouk Matteo Peony Duvet Cover Collection](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Matouk+Bedding?utm\_term=matouk-matteo-peony-duvet-cover-collection)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Matouk+Bedding?utm_term=matouk-matteo-peony-duvet-cover-collection"><img alt="matouk-matteo-duvet-cover-peony-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/matouk-matteo-duvet-cover-peony-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the pleasure of trying out Matouk's Matteo Matteo Duvet Cover in the Peony color. The duvet cover is made from 100% cotton seersucker, giving it a luxurious, sophisticated feel. One of the standout features was the 4-inch diamond stitch pattern that added a touch of elegance to my bedding. 

However, one downside was that there weren't any duvet ties included to prevent the insert from slipping around. It's a small detail, but something that I wish had been included for a product at this price point. Overall, the duvet cover is beautifully made and would be a great addition to anyone's bed. It washes easily in the machine, albeit using warm water and avoiding fabric softener to maintain its quality. And the fact that it's made in the USA using Portuguese fabric is an extra bonus.

### [Matouk Essex Duvet Cover in Pool with Elegant Embroidery](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Matouk+Bedding?utm\_term=matouk-essex-duvet-cover-in-pool-with-elegant-embroidery)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Matouk+Bedding?utm_term=matouk-essex-duvet-cover-in-pool-with-elegant-embroidery"><img alt="matouk-essex-duvet-cover-in-pool-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/matouk-essex-duvet-cover-in-pool-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As I unfolded the Matouk Essex duvet cover, the vibrant embroidery of pool water greeted me. The 350 thread count percale fabric felt silky smooth, and the crisp lines of satin stitch embroidery added a touch of elegance. The duvet cover effortlessly fit onto my king-sized mattress, and the soft sheen of the fabric felt luxurious against my skin. 

The standout feature was the convenience of the zipper closure, making it a breeze to change the duvet cover without the hassle of buttons. The long-staple cotton percale fabric also ensured that the duvet cover was breathable, perfect for those warm summer nights. 

However, the sizing seemed a bit off, and I noticed that the duvet cover did not reach the bottom of the mattress. It would have been ideal if the Full and Queen sizes were separate for better coverage. Additionally, the pillowcases required large inserts for a proper fit, which was an unexpected need. 

Overall, the Matouk Essex duvet cover was a delightful addition to my bedding set, with its luxurious feel, elegant embroidery, and convenient zipper closure. While the sizing and insert issues were minor, they did slightly impact the overall experience.

However, despite the luxurious stitch finish and Italian fabric, the sheets do wrinkle. While this isn't a deal-breaker for me, it's worth considering if you're someone who prefers a crisp, crease-free finish. Furthermore, this product needs gentle care to maintain its softness and luxury feel. 

Overall, the Matouk Luca Satin Stitch Bedding comes highly recommended for its fit, material, and ability to withstand multiple washings. Despite the minor wrinkles and the pricier tag, the comfort and sophistication this brings to your bedding is worth the expense.

## Buyer's Guide

Matouk bedding offers a range of high-quality products for your bedroom needs. From luxurious sheets to cozy comforters, Matouk's offerings cater to a variety of preferences and budgets. Here's a buyer's guide to help you navigate the Matouk bedding world, making sure you choose the right products for your home. 


### Consider the Fabric

Matouk produces bedding in different materials, including cotton, linen, and silk. Each material has its own advantages and disadvantages. Cotton is the most common choice, providing a comfortable and breathable experience. Linen offers a natural feel, but it wrinkles easily. Silk is the most luxurious option, providing a cool and smooth surface. Consider your personal preferences when choosing a Matouk bedding piece. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Matouk+Bedding"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Matouk-Bedding-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Matouk-Bedding-2" height="540"></a></div>


### Comfort and Warmth

Matouk bedding products provide varying degrees of warmth. Check the fill power of down products or the thread count for cotton to get an idea of the warmth level. For cooler climates, choose a higher fill power down or a thread count of at least 300-400. For warmer climates, opt for a lower fill power or a lighter thread count. As a rule of thumb, the higher the thread count or fill power, the warmer the bedding. 


### Maintenance and Care

To extend the life and maintain the quality of your Matouk bedding, follow the care instructions provided by the manufacturer. Generally, it's best to wash your bedding in cold water on a gentle cycle and avoid using fabric softeners. If possible, air dry your bedding items rather than using a dryer. For silk items, hand-washing and air-drying is recommended.
