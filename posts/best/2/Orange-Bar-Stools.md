### [Karlye Velvet Orange Bar Stools - Rosdorf Park Color](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Orange+Bar+Stools?utm\_term=karlye-velvet-orange-bar-stools-rosdorf-park-color)

The Karlye stool is a 27.2-inch tall, orange velvet and black-framed seating that adds a touch of elegance to any dining room, living room, or bar. Made of solid wood, these stools come in a set of two, with each weighing in at 18.7 pounds. Despite its minimalist design, it includes upholstered seats with tufting for added comfort, and foam stuffing to provide maximum cushioning.

For example, one user pointed out an issue with the wobbliness of one of their stools and a defected leg. Overall, these stools might be an eye-catching addition to any room but expect the need for repairs or replacements, and make a conscious choice on how well they serve your needs.
