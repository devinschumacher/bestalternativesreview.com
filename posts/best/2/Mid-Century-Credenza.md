### [Modern Two-Tone Sideboard with Sliding Doors - Flory Collection by TMS](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Mid+Century+Credenza?utm\_term=modern-two-tone-sideboard-with-sliding-doors-flory-collection-by-tms)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Mid+Century+Credenza?utm_term=modern-two-tone-sideboard-with-sliding-doors-flory-collection-by-tms"><img alt="tms-flory-mid-century-two-tone-55-inch-sideboard-walnut-finish-brown-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tms-flory-mid-century-two-tone-55-inch-sideboard-walnut-finish-brown-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently added the Flory Mid-Century Two-Tone Sideboard to my dining room, and it's been a game-changer for organizing my tableware and dinnerware collection. The walnut finish brown gave the sideboard a classy, timeless look that beautifully blends with my mid-century modern motif. 

One of my favorite features is the sliding doors with a subtle golden over silver tone finish, making it a great conversation starter. However, I noticed that the doors don't glide smoothly, which can make it challenging to access the storage compartment. Still, the sideboard is stable and sturdy, making it a worthwhile addition to my space. 

Setting up the sideboard was easy, but I did encounter a minor issue with one of the doors not fitting properly. This resulted in a small scratch on the finish, though I'm hopeful that Overstock will provide a discount to cover the damage. 

Overall, the Flory Mid-Century Two-Tone Sideboard has been an attractive and functional addition to my home. While it could have been taller or the sliding doors could have been easier to open, the quality craftsmanship and modern design make it a worthy investment.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Mid+Century+Credenza?utm_term=mid-century-modern-sideboard-with-movable-shelves-midnight-blue"><img alt="lifestorey-tabaria-mid-century-four-door-sideboard-buffet-midnight-blue-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lifestorey-tabaria-mid-century-four-door-sideboard-buffet-midnight-blue-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

In my quest to revive my living space with a touch of Mid-Century modern, I came across the Tabaria Sideboard from Lifestorey. This sleek, Midnight Blue cabinet promises a unique blend of style and functionality, with ample storage space for all those essentials. Its movable interior shelves and sturdy MDF construction are intriguing, but there's more to this cabinet than meets the eye. 

Upon receiving my purchase, I was immediately struck by the cabinet's striking blue finish. The gold-toned metal handles and legs add a touch of elegance, but it was the front door panels with their grooved pattern that truly captured my attention.

The instructions, while comprehensive, could have been more user-friendly. 

One of the standout features of the Tabaria Sideboard is its spacious interior, which is perfect for storing dishes, serving pieces, linens, and other items. I appreciate the movable shelves that make organization a breeze. However, despite the cabinet's robust construction, I noticed some odd odors during the assembly process, which may warrant further investigation. 

The key to enjoying this cabinet is the careful consideration of the weight it will be subjected to, especially when placing heavier items such as TVs on top. The cabinet does come with all the necessary hardware to wall-mount it, which I would highly recommend for added security and peace of mind. 

In conclusion, the Lifestorey Tabaria Sideboard offers a striking blend of style and storage capabilities, and despite some minor setbacks, I'd recommend it to anyone seeking to add a touch of Mid-Century modern to their living space.
