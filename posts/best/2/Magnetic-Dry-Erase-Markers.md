As a reviewer, I've been using the Quartet ReWritables Dry Erase Markers and they've become a game-changer in my daily life. These mini markers are not just compact; they are an eraser and a board in one. The vibrant colors make my messages pop, and their magnetic tops ensure they are always within reach. 

One of the standout features of these markers is the fine point tip, which produces precise lines that are perfect for clear, distinct handwriting and detailed drawings. The low odor, non-toxic ink ensures a safe and healthy environment for the whole family. 

However, I did encounter drawbacks. Upon receiving them, some markers were faint and required more pressure than usual for the ink to show up. Also, the price tag might be seen as a bit high for some users. 

Overall, these markers are a great addition to any office or home, and their magnetic feature is a life saver. With the right pressure, they provide vibrant colors that make your board come alive.

The fine point allows for precise highlighting, and they're versatile, working well on various surfaces such as whiteboards, glass, and nonporous materials. 

The erasability of the marks has been a breeze, making them easy to clean, especially when using a dry-erase surface. However, I've noticed that certain colors, such as dark green and blue-green, have occasionally left some permanent stains on my whiteboard. Perhaps a stronger, more vibrant color would be better suited for long-term use. 

Overall, the magnetic dry erase markers by Mr. Pen are a convenient set of tools for any office or home. Their color range, fine point, and versatility make them a pleasure to use daily, but be cautious about the potential permanent staining on some surfaces.

## Buyer's Guide

Are you in search of an efficient and eco-friendly writing tool for your whiteboard or dry erase board? Magnetic dry erase markers can be the perfect solution to suit your needs. In this buyer's guide, we will discuss important features, considerations, and advice to help you make an informed decision when purchasing magnetic dry erase markers. 


### Magnet Strength

One of the key features of magnetic dry erase markers is their magnetism. The marker's magnet strength determines how effectively it can cling to your dry erase board or whiteboard. Look for markers with strong magnets that securely hold the marker in place. Make sure to check the manufacturer's specifications for magnet strength, as some may be stronger than others. 


### Marker Durability

Consider the durability of the marker when making your purchase. The tip of a magnetic dry erase marker can occasionally wear down over time due to repeated usage. A marker with a replaceable tip is preferable, as it allows you to continue using the same marker body without needing to purchase a new one entirely. Additionally, ensure the marker is made from high-quality materials that can withstand daily use. 


###  Writing Consistency

Another factor to consider is the writing consistency of the marker. The ink should flow smoothly and consistently, without bleeding, smudging, or leaving streaks behind. This is especially important for people who frequently use dry erase markers in large quantities during presentations or meetings. Ink drying quickly is also an essential feature, as it helps prevent smudges from occurring. 


### Eco-Friendliness

Eco-friendliness is an essential aspect to consider when purchasing magnetic dry erase markers. Look for markers made from sustainable materials, such as recycled plastic, and those that produce minimal waste. Refillable markers are also an eco-friendly option, as they reduce the amount of plastic waste generated by continuously buying new markers.
