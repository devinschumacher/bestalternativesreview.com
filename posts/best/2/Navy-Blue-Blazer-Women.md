### [Alexia Admor Navy Blue Women's Blazer - Size 8](https://serp.ly/amazon/Navy+Blue+Blazer+Women?utm\_term=alexia-admor-navy-blue-womens-blazer-size-8)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Navy+Blue+Blazer+Women?utm_term=alexia-admor-navy-blue-womens-blazer-size-8"><img alt="alexia-admor-womens-jessica-peak-lapel-blazer-navy-size-9" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alexia-admor-womens-jessica-peak-lapel-blazer-navy-size-9/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When I first tried on the Alexia Admor Women's Jessica Peak Lapel Blazer, I was immediately drawn to its navy blue hue and the peaked lapels that added a touch of elegance. The 27-inch length fit perfectly on my 5'10" frame, and the lining made the blazer feel comfortable and high-quality. 

However, there were a few things that bothered me. The material felt a bit cheap, even though it was 97% polyester and 3% spandex. I also noticed that the buttons on the sleeves were crooked, but I was confident that I could fix this minor issue with some re-sewing. 

One of my biggest concerns was the fit. Although the sleeves were a bit too long, the overall blazer ran small, so I had to size up. Luckily, the tailor was able to alter the hem in a way that maintained its curve, but it was still a bit of a hassle. 

Despite these minor issues, I found the Jessica Peak Lapel Blazer to be a stylish and versatile piece that I could easily dress up or down. I enjoyed wearing the blazer over dresses for work events and was pleased with the overall look and feel. However, it would be worth considering the fit issues and tailoring costs before purchasing. 


### [Stylish Navy Blue Women's Blazer with Single Button Closure](https://serp.ly/amazon/Navy+Blue+Blazer+Women?utm\_term=stylish-navy-blue-womens-blazer-with-single-button-closure)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Navy+Blue+Blazer+Women?utm_term=stylish-navy-blue-womens-blazer-with-single-button-closure"><img alt="jones-new-york-womens-long-sleeve-1-button-blazer-jacket-with-crest-10833712-navy-blue-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/jones-new-york-womens-long-sleeve-1-button-blazer-jacket-with-crest-10833712-navy-blue-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Recently, I had the chance to try on the Jones New York Women's Long Sleeve 1 Button Blazer Jacket with Crest. Its navy blue hue truly stood out, making it a versatile piece for any wardrobe. The single-button closure and notched lapel collar added a touch of elegance, while the long sleeves and pockets provided both style and practicality. 

The 98% cotton and 2% elastane blend made the blazer comfortable to wear, even during long hours at the office. However, it was slightly disappointing to find that the quality was not up to par, as some users noted the material felt cheap. Additionally, it was surprising to discover that the sizing seemed off for some customers, with a woman's large fitting more like a child's large. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, the Jones New York Women's Long Sleeve 1 Button Blazer Jacket with Crest could be a great addition to any woman's wardrobe, especially for lunch meetings or office settings. 


### [Navy Blue Lapel Belted Blazer for Women](https://serp.ly/amazon/Navy+Blue+Blazer+Women?utm\_term=navy-blue-lapel-belted-blazer-for-women)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Navy+Blue+Blazer+Women?utm_term=navy-blue-lapel-belted-blazer-for-women"><img alt="alexia-admor-womens-olya-notch-lapel-belted-blazer-navy-size-9" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alexia-admor-womens-olya-notch-lapel-belted-blazer-navy-size-9/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

This navy blue blazer from Alexia Admor is a chic choice for any woman looking to elevate her style. The faux leather material has a luxurious look and feel, and the long length adds a sophisticated touch. 

The belt detail is a unique feature that can cinch the waist and create a flattering silhouette. However, based on user reviews, the sizing may not be accurate, as the jacket runs small and does not fit true to size. The lining ensures comfort and the long sleeves add warmth, making this blazer a versatile option for different seasons. 

Overall, it's a beautifully designed piece, but pay close attention to the sizing before making a purchase. 


### [Calvin Klein Navy Single-Button Blazer for Women](https://serp.ly/amazon/Navy+Blue+Blazer+Women?utm\_term=calvin-klein-navy-single-button-blazer-for-women)

I recently tried on the Navy-blue Calvin Klein Women's Single-Button Blazer, and it definitely made a statement. The navy color is bold but classic, perfect for adding some sophistication to any outfit. One thing I appreciate about this blazer is its slim fit - it makes me look sharp and polished. 

The notched lapels give it a stylish edge, and the single button closure with goldtone trim adds a touch of elegance. It's not too bulky, and it's comfortable to wear, which is essential for me when I'm dressing up for the day. 

Unfortunately, not everyone had a great experience with this blazer. Some reviewers mentioned it being too bulky in the chest area and the back, pointing out a poor cut. But overall, it's a great value for a Calvin Klein blazer, which can be quite pricey. So, if you're looking for a chic, affordable option, this one could be just what you need.

However, some have mentioned that the color may be slightly lighter than expected, more of a dark royal blue rather than a true navy. Additionally, a few customers have shared that the sizing runs a bit small, so it may be wise to consider ordering one size up if you are unsure of your measurements.

A functional double welt pocket on the chest provides ample storage as well as style points. For added breathability and ease of movement, it boasts a back vent. 

Despite its impressive functionality, some reviewers have pointed out concerns about sizing, noting inconsistencies in the cut of the jacket. The blazer has been reported to run small in terms of the fit, with sizes being too tight in the arms and shoulders, potentially limiting range of motion. This issue has left customers wishing for a more accurate sizing guide. The lining on certain jackets has also been criticized for not sewing well, leading to an uncomfortable fit and compromising the overall quality.
