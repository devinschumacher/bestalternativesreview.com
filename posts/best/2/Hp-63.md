I've been using the HP 63 Ink Cartridges in my home office for quite some time now, and I must say, they've been a lifesaver. The black ink has been consistently delivering up to two times more prints than non-original HP ink, which is perfect for my daily document needs. And the vibrant colors of the cartridges? They've made my printed photos truly pop. 

However, there have been a few hiccups along the way. A couple of times, the ink cartridges arrived without their original packaging, which felt a bit sketchy. I've also had to deal with some customer service issues when items were delivered incorrectly or without the proper shipping details. 

Overall, if you're willing to tolerate the occasional mishap, the HP 63 Ink Cartridges are a reliable and cost-effective solution for your home or office printing needs.

### [HP 63XL Remanufactured Ink Cartridge Replacement by Office Depot](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Hp+63?utm\_term=hp-63xl-remanufactured-ink-cartridge-replacement-by-office-depot)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Hp+63?utm_term=hp-63xl-remanufactured-ink-cartridge-replacement-by-office-depot"><img alt="office-depot-brand-od63xlk63c-remanufactured-black-tri-color-ink-cartridge-replacement-for-hp-63xl-7" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/office-depot-brand-od63xlk63c-remanufactured-black-tri-color-ink-cartridge-replacement-for-hp-63xl-7/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried the Office Depot Brand OD63XLK63C Remanufactured Black / Tri-Color Ink Cartridge Replacement for HP 63XL, and it made quite an impression. One of the first things that stood out to me was its eco-friendliness - I loved how it's made from quality recovered cartridges, helping reduce waste and potentially save money. 

However, there were a few things I noticed that needed to be improved. For one, it's a bit confusing that Office Depot doesn't provide information on whether these cartridges are brand new or refilled. It would have been helpful to know this upfront, as some users might feel hesitant about purchasing refilled cartridges. 

Additionally, I've had issues with color cartridges in the past, and this one was no exception. While it worked with my printer without any problems, I've noticed that color cartridges tend to run out faster than black ones. It would have been great if there was an option to purchase both black and color cartridges in an XL version, as this would benefit users who heavily rely on color printing. 

Despite these minor concerns, I'm overall happy with the product and its commitment to eco-consciousness. It's a reliable, budget-friendly alternative for those who are looking to save money and reduce waste.
