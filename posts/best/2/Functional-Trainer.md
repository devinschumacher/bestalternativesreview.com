The Inspire Fitness FT2 Functional Trainer has been a game-changer in my home gym setup. As someone who had limited space for equipment, the compact design of this functional trainer and Smith machine was a major selling point for me. 

One of the standout features of this unit is its 32 pulley height adjustments. It has given me the flexibility to incorporate a wide range of exercises into my routine, allowing for greater muscle development and variety. I particularly appreciate the independent dual wide pulleys, which make it easy to switch between upper and lower body exercises seamlessly.

While the FT2 has many positives, there have been a few minor issues that have cropped up. One of these is the leg attachment rollers, which have a tendency to slide off center and sometimes come off completely. This appears to be a design issue that could be addressed with stronger or more secure fasteners. 

Another issue I encountered was the cable coating on one of the leg cables that came off during use. This may have been due to the specific vendor I purchased from, so it's worth considering purchasing directly from Inspire Fitness to avoid any potential issues. 

Overall, the Inspire Fitness FT2 Functional Trainer has been a fantastic addition to my home gym. Its versatility, ease of use, and compact design make it a great investment for anyone looking to create a functional workout space. Despite

One of my favorite features was the resistance method, which relied on my body weight instead of additional weights. This meant that I could easily adjust the resistance by simply changing my position or angle of the exercise. The included app with on-demand courses was a great bonus, as it provided me with plenty of exercise options and routines to follow. 

While the Inspire FT1 Functional Trainer had many positive aspects, there were a couple of drawbacks. The first was the size of the machine, which made it a bit difficult to find a suitable space in my home.

They combine the functions of different gym equipment, making them a convenient and cost-effective choice for in-home workouts or smaller commercial gyms. In this buyer's guide, we'll discuss the important features, considerations, and general advice for selecting the best functional trainer for your needs. 


### Important Features of Functional Trainers

1. Adjustable resistance: Look for functional trainers with adjustable resistance settings, allowing you to customize the workout intensity according to your fitness level and goals. Most functional trainers use either a weight stack or cam system for resistance, with the weight stack offering a smoother resistance curve. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Functional+Trainer"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Functional-Trainer-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Functional-Trainer-2" height="540"></a></div>


### Considerations for Choosing a Functional Trainer

1. Space and footprint: Consider the available space in your home or gym when selecting a functional trainer. Some models are compact and can fit in smaller spaces, while others may require more room. Measure the area where you plan to place the trainer and compare it to the manufacturer's specifications to ensure a proper fit. 


### General Advice for Purchasing a Functional Trainer

1. Durability: Choose a functional trainer made from high-quality materials, such as commercial-grade steel, to ensure long-lasting performance. Heavy-duty components like bearings and pulleys will also contribute to a smoother and more efficient workout experience. Look for warranties covering the frame, parts, and labor to protect your investment.

### Safety Features to Consider

### What is a functional trainer?

A functional trainer is a versatile piece of fitness equipment that allows for a wide range of exercises targeting different muscle groups. Designed for both commercial and home use, these trainers often come equipped with multiple stations, handles, and resistance arms. They are known for their ability to simulate real-life movements, resulting in improved strength, balance, and overall fitness. 

Some popular functional trainers include the Bowflex Blaze Home Gym, PowerLine Fitness PPR216X Workbench, and the Total Gym Fit. Each offers unique features and capabilities tailored to specific workout needs and preferences. Functional trainers can be an excellent investment for anyone looking to enhance their fitness routine at home or in a gym setting. 


### What makes a good functional trainer?

A high-quality functional trainer should have several features that ensure a comprehensive and effective workout experience. These include: varied resistance levels, smooth operation, durable construction, and easy assembly. Additionally, a good functional trainer should provide enough space for users to comfortably perform various exercises without compromising safety or stability. 

Some functional trainers, like the Bowflex Blaze Home Gym, even come with additional accessories such as a leg attachment or a preacher curl pad, further expanding the exercise options.

### Are functional trainers suitable for beginners?

Yes, functional trainers can be a great option for beginners looking to build strength, flexibility, and overall fitness. Many models offer a variety of exercises and resistance levels, allowing users to progress at their own pace. The ability to mimic real-life movements also makes functional trainers an attractive choice for those who are new to exercising or wish to maintain their current fitness levels. 

However, it's essential for beginners to follow proper form and technique when using a functional trainer to avoid injury. This may involve consulting with a fitness professional or reviewing instructional materials provided by the manufacturer. With proper guidance and practice, anyone can enjoy the benefits of a functional trainer in their fitness journey. 


### How much space does a functional trainer require?

Functional trainers come in various sizes, but it's essential to consider the available space in your home or gym before making a purchase. Generally speaking, most functional trainers require a minimum footprint of around 10 to 15 feet in length and 6 to 10 feet in width. However, some models may be more compact, while others might be larger, depending on their features and capabilities. 

If space is a concern, it's advisable to choose a functional trainer with foldable or collapsible parts that allow for easier storage when not in use. Additionally, ensuring that the functional trainer is installed in an area with ample clearance from walls and obstacles can help maximize its functionality and safety.

### What is the maximum weight capacity of a functional trainer?

Weight capacity varies depending on the model and brand of the functional trainer. Generally, most residential models can support users weighing up to 300 pounds. Commercial-grade functional trainers, on the other hand, might have a higher weight capacity, ranging from 400 to 700 pounds or more. It's essential to consult the manufacturer's specifications for the exact weight capacity of a specific functional trainer model. 

Ensuring that a functional trainer has an appropriate weight capacity is crucial in maintaining safety and preventing injury. Choosing a trainer with a higher weight capacity than necessary can provide additional peace of mind for users who expect to reach their fitness goals quickly or want to ensure the equipment will last for years. 


### How much does a functional trainer cost?

The price of a functional trainer can vary significantly depending on its features, capabilities, and the brand. Entry-level, or personal trainer models can range from $500 to $1,500, while mid-range models offer more features and resistance levels and typically cost between $1,500 to $3,000. High-end or commercial-grade functional trainers, designed for heavy usage and with multiple stations and attachments, can cost anywhere from $3,000 to $15,000 or more. 

It's essential to consider your budget and the specific features you require when choosing a functional trainer. While a higher-priced model may come with more amenities, it's possible to find excellent value in mid-range and even lower-priced models that still offer a wide range of exercises and resistance levels.
