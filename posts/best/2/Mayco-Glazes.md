<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Mayco+Glazes?utm_term=mayco-glaze-speckled-toad-pint"><img alt="mayco-stoneware-classic-glaze-speckled-toad-pint-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mayco-stoneware-classic-glaze-speckled-toad-pint-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an artist who's always on the lookout for quality supplies, I recently tried out Mayco's Stoneware Classic Glaze in Speckled Toad, and let me tell you, it exceeded my expectations! I've been working with a lot of different glazes, but this one has become a staple in my art studio. The versatility and ease of use it offers are unmatched. 

One feature that stood out to me is the wide temperature range it's designed for. I usually fire at cone 6, but this glaze performed just as well at cone 10, both in oxidation and reduction. Plus, the glaze compatibility with other Mayco glazes is a game-changer for creating intricate visual effects. 

While I've had nothing but a positive experience with this glaze, I do want to mention that there have been some variations in color from the previous batches I've used. This pint of Speckled Toad has a much more red and purple tone compared to the previous ones I've used. But, it's not a bad color, just a little different. 

Overall, I couldn't be happier with my experience using Mayco's Stoneware Classic Glaze in Speckled Toad. It's become a go-to in my art studio, and I highly recommend it for any artist looking for a reliable and high-quality glaze.

However, I did notice that the color was not exactly what I expected, as it was much more red and purple than I anticipated. I attempted to test different parts of the kiln to see if this issue could be resolved, but unfortunately, it was consistent across all firing temperatures and techniques.
