### [SLS Sleek Concealment Holster for H&K HK45](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Hk45+Holster?utm\_term=sls-sleek-concealment-holster-for-hk-hk45)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Hk45+Holster?utm_term=sls-sleek-concealment-holster-for-hk-hk45"><img alt="model-6287-sls-belt-slide-concealment-holster-for-hk-hk45-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/model-6287-sls-belt-slide-concealment-holster-for-hk-hk45-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a concealed carry enthusiast, I was excited to try the Model 6287 SLS Belt Slide Holster for my H&K HK45. On a recent outing, I found myself in a situation where I needed to access my firearm quickly. With the Model 6287, I was able to draw my weapon smoothly and securely, thanks to the Self Locking System (SLS) rotating hood design. 

The holster's 567BL belt loop easily accommodated my 1.5-inch to 1.75-inch belt, and I appreciated the smoother single-motion draw. The rotating hood provided an added layer of protection against attempted weapon takeaways, as it could only be released by simultaneous downward and forward movement. 

One slight downside was the durability. While the SafariLaminate construction was sturdy, it didn't seem as hardwearing as some other options on the market. However, this holster's ease of use and security outweighed this minor issue. 

Overall, the Model 6287 SLS Belt Slide Holster proved to be a trustworthy and reliable option for concealed carry. With its unique features and sleek design, it's a great choice for those who want a secure and easy-to-use holster for their H&K HK45.
