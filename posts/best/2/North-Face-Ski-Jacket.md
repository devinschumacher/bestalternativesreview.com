<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/North+Face+Ski+Jacket?utm_term=mens-recycled-north-face-insulated-ski-jacket"><img alt="the-north-face-freedom-insulated-jacket-mens-boysenberry-almond-butter-l-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/the-north-face-freedom-insulated-jacket-mens-boysenberry-almond-butter-l-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Men's North Face Ceptor DryVent Ski Jacket - Boysenberry/Almond Butter](https://serp.ly/amazon/North+Face+Ski+Jacket?utm\_term=mens-north-face-ceptor-dryvent-ski-jacket-boysenberry-almond-butter)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/North+Face+Ski+Jacket?utm_term=mens-north-face-ceptor-dryvent-ski-jacket-boysenberry-almond-butter"><img alt="the-north-face-ceptor-jacket-mens-boysenberry-almond-butter-l-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/the-north-face-ceptor-jacket-mens-boysenberry-almond-butter-l-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

My recent experience with the Ceptor Jacket from the North Face has been quite interesting, to say the least. As an outdoor enthusiast, I wanted a high-performance ski jacket that would suit my needs without breaking the bank. However, upon receiving the jacket, I realized that it was made primarily from polyester and didn't have any insulation. Instead, it relied on the DryVent 3L, a water-repellent treatment for added protection from snow and moisture. 

The first thing that caught my attention was its sizing. The regular fit seemed to be on the longer side, especially for the sleeves, which I found rather surprising. While it might fit people who prefer a loose boxy shape, it wasn't quite my style. I had a chance to try another North Face jacket, the Freedom, which had a standard fit that suited me better. This made me think that it would be wise to try on different sizes or return it to find a better fit. 

That being said, I appreciated the many thoughtful features that the Ceptor Jacket offered. The powder skirt integrated into the jacket provided a decent barrier against snow, and the goggle pocket located on the left forearm was surprisingly useful. The helmet-compatible hood also worked well, providing adequate coverage without restricting my movement. 

The fabric quality seemed quite durable, and the color combination of Boysenberry and Almond Butter was undeniably stylish. After testing the jacket in various conditions, including snow and rain, I can confirm that it lived up to my expectations in terms of weather resistance. While it wasn't the warmest option for colder temperatures, it could still handle reasonable conditions with the help of my base layers. 

In conclusion, the Ceptor Jacket from the North Face is a well-made, versatile ski jacket that offers both style and protection from the elements. However, it may require careful consideration when it comes to choosing the right fit, as the lack of insulation might not be suitable for everyone. Despite my personal fit issues, I think this jacket would be an excellent option for those who are looking for a reliable, waterproof shell that doesn't compromise on style.

And the powder skirt? A complete game-changer. No more snow getting inside the jacket – such a clever design. 

Even though it was breathable, I didn't feel cold spots in the jacket, which was a pleasant surprise. But there was one downside: I found the wrist cuffs a bit too tight. It wasn't a deal-breaker for me, but a little more stretch would have been perfect.
