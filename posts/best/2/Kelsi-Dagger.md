Despite the high-quality craftsmanship, the Belle Dress Sandal still had a slight drawback - it was a bit wider than I'd prefer. But overall, this was a small price to pay for the comfort and style it offered. I'm looking forward to adding more styles from Kelsi Dagger to my collection.

### [Kelsi Dagger Stylish Mauve Women's Boots](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Kelsi+Dagger?utm\_term=kelsi-dagger-stylish-mauve-womens-boots)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Kelsi+Dagger?utm_term=kelsi-dagger-stylish-mauve-womens-boots"><img alt="kelsi-dagger-brooklyn-logan-womens-boots-mauve-7-5-m-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/kelsi-dagger-brooklyn-logan-womens-boots-mauve-7-5-m-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried the Kelsi Dagger Brooklyn Logan Women's Boots in the Mauve color, size 7.5 M, and here's my honest review of my experience with them. 

Firstly, I must say that the boots are eye-catching with their thigh-high silhouette and stacked block heels. The elasticized back panel ensures a comfortable fit, and the suede upper construction offers an elegant touch. However, I noticed the canvas lining and footbed were not the most comfortable for long-term wear. 

During my time wearing these boots, I found that they ran a little small, especially around the calf area for those with larger calves. I had to exchange the wide width I initially ordered for the standard size, which fit perfectly. The heel height of 3.15 inches provided some added comfort, but the stacked leather material might not be the best choice for people with sensitive feet. 

While the round toe design and recycled rubber outsole are great features, I've noticed that the color of the boots can leave marks on my legs, which may be an issue for some users. Overall, I appreciate the stylish and edgy look of the Kelsi Dagger Brooklyn Logan Women's Boots, but their comfort and fit could be improved for a wider range of users.

The Kelsi Dagger Brooklyn Dover platform sandal has been a staple in my wardrobe for quite some time now. I recently tried this sandal with a light brown hue and a size 8 fit, making it perfect for daily use.

And speaking of my feet, these boots are incredibly comfortable! The heel isn't too high or too low, and the back opening is perfect for my larger calves. 

The zipper running partially up the bootie's back can be a bit unconventional, but I've grown to love it. It gives a unique edge to the bootie, and it serves as a great conversation starter, especially when paired with a cool, high-waisted skirt. 

The sole also deserves a shout-out. It's made of recycled rubber, offering great traction with a bit of sustainability thrown in for good measure. The bottom material under the ball of my foot adds a lot of cushion when walking or standing for long periods. 

So, overall, the Kelsi Dagger Brooklyn Island bootie has been a delightful addition to my daily style.

Last summer, I slipped into a pair of Brooklyn Theory camel thong sandals by Kelsi Dagger, hoping to add some flair to my summer wardrobe.
