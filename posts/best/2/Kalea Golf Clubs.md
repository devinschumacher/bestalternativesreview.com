The large head and low CG make it extremely forgiving, which I found to be a significant advantage for someone like me who struggles with consistently making contact. Not only does the low CG help with forgiveness, but it also produces a high, easy launch, allowing me to get more distance out of each shot. 

Another standout feature is the Cap Back Design. This design, combined with the Speed Pocket, promotes optimized face flexibility, ball speed, and distance. I was pleasantly surprised by how much distance I gained with the hybrid clubs compared to other sets I've used. The Cap Back Design also helps minimize unwanted vibrations, resulting in a soft and solid feel. 

While the Combo Set has really helped me improve my overall game, there are a couple of areas where I believe TaylorMade could improve. First, I found the shaft to be a bit on the stiffer side, which might not be ideal for everyone, especially those looking for a smoother swing. Second, I wish there was a 6 iron included in the set, as it can be a crucial club for many golfers. 

Overall, I am thrilled with the performance and design of the TaylorMade Kalea Premier Women's Combo Set. It has made an incredible impact on my golf game and inspired me to continue working on my swing. If you're a beginner or someone looking to improve your game, I would definitely recommend giving this set a try.
