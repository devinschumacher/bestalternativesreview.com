The mixer often struggles and gets stuck, but not with this one. With enough torque to power through heavy ingredients, it's a dream come true. And the best part? It's dishwasher safe.

Despite all these amazing features, the KitchenAid 7-Speed Hand Mixer still feels like a comfortable, well-balanced tool in my hand. It fits comfortably and eliminates hand fatigue during long mixing sessions. And the user-friendly controls are right at your thumb, making it entirely one-hand operable.

### [Onyx Black Variable Speed Blender by KitchenAid](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Kitchenaid+7+Speed+Hand+Mixer?utm\_term=onyx-black-variable-speed-blender-by-kitchenaid)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Kitchenaid+7+Speed+Hand+Mixer?utm_term=onyx-black-variable-speed-blender-by-kitchenaid"><img alt="kitchenaid-variable-speed-corded-hand-blender-onyx-black-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/kitchenaid-variable-speed-corded-hand-blender-onyx-black-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I couldn't resist the opportunity to try it out, despite the lack of detailed reviews. As soon as I plugged it in and began using it for various blending tasks, its versatility became apparent. 

My favorite feature was the onyx black design, which added style to my kitchen and made it a great conversation starter. The removable 8-inch blending arm was particularly convenient, as it allowed for easy cleaning and protection with the patented US pan guard. However, it was not without its drawbacks. 

The 3-cup blending jar was great for individual blending jobs, but the lack of a specific cleaning guide made its aftercare process a bit of a trial and error. It was also a bit heavier and not as comfortable in the hand as I had initially hoped, which was a minor let-down. 

Overall, I enjoyed the experience of using the KitchenAid Variable Speed Corded Hand Blender, Onyx Black. It offers a variety of blending jobs without losing its signature KitchenAid touch. But just like any other product, it has its pros and cons. [If you're willing to experiment and enjoy the beauty of versatile blenders in your kitchen, this one might just be worth the try.](https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativereviews.com/blob/main/posts/best/2/Ninja-Food-Blender.md)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Kitchenaid+7+Speed+Hand+Mixer?utm_term=cordless-variable-speed-charcoal-grey-kitchenaid-hand-blender"><img alt="kitchenaid-cordless-variable-speed-charcoal-grey-hand-blender-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/kitchenaid-cordless-variable-speed-charcoal-grey-hand-blender-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When I first heard about the KitchenAid Cordless Variable Speed Charcoal Grey Hand Blender, I thought it would be quite a handy kitchen gadget, but didn't expect much from it. However, after using it, I must say I've grown quite fond of it. The sleek matte charcoal grey color, which happens to match my other KitchenAid appliances, is a plus. I've had no issues with plastic durability, but the rechargeable lithium-ion battery has indeed been a game-changer in my kitchen. 

The stainless steel and plastic construction of the hand blender is quite sturdy, which has given me a sense of confidence while using it. The variable speed trigger switch, paired with the safety switch, provides the user with efficient control over their cooking process. The pan guard that comes along with this is a great feature to protect cookware from damage. 

The blending arm that features a 4-point stainless steel blade can handle a variety of tasks, from smoothies to soups and makes quick work out of them. The fact that this blender arm can be replaced saves quite a bit of money in the long run. The lidded blending jar and removable pan guard are an added bonus. 

The accessories that come with this hand blender are dishwasher safe and relatively easy to clean. However, I found the quick charge feature to be quite limited. The battery light indicator is a good reminder to recharge the blender once the power runs low. 

Overall, if youâ€™re after a convenient, cordless handheld blender, I recommend giving the KitchenAid Cordless Variable Speed Charcoal Grey Hand Blender a try. The ease of use, functionality, and the added pan guard make it a worthwhile investment for any kitchen. Its only drawback is the lack of interchangeable attachments and a slightly inconvenient charging process.

### [KitchenAid Cordless Variable Speed Hand Blender & Chopper](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Kitchenaid+7+Speed+Hand+Mixer?utm\_term=kitchenaid-cordless-variable-speed-hand-blender-chopper)

The KitchenAid cordless variable speed black matte hand blender is a convenient and powerful addition to any busy home chef's kitchen. I've been using it daily for a few weeks now, and it's made blending tasks a breeze. The hand blender's rechargeable lithium-ion battery allows for exceptional runtime and performance, ensuring that you can cook and blend up to 25 bowls of soup on a full charge. 

The cordless feature, which is perfect for those of us with small kitchens that can easily become entangled with cords, allows for smooth and easy movement around the kitchen without worrying about tripping over pesky cords. One of the most notable features is the adjustable speed settings, which offer greater control when blending a variety of ingredients. However, I found it a bit challenging to distinguish between the different speed settings, as pressing the button at certain pressures is required to activate the desired speed. 

The blender's design is sleek and comfortable to grip, but I wish it came with a more convenient way to store it. Although the cardboard box it arrives in can be repurposed as a storage case, it's not the most practical or attractive option. When it comes to kitchen tools, this hand blender is a game-changer, and I would highly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable and versatile blender for their daily cooking adventures.
