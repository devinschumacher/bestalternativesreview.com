I recently started using the New Balance Nitrel V4 trail running shoes and have been thoroughly impressed with their durability and overall performance. One key aspect that stands out to me is the Dynafoam sole, which provides an incredible amount of cushioning and support on the trail, making it feel as though I'm walking on clouds. 

While they are not perfect, there's one aspect of the design that left me wanting more - the narrow toe box. I have wide feet and found that the toes felt a bit cramped while wearing these shoes. However, I understand this may vary based on individual foot shapes. 

Overall, I'd highly recommend giving these shoes a try if you're searching for a durable and comfortable pair of trail runners.

### [New Balance Women's Dynasoft Nitrel V4 Running Shoes](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/New+Balance+Nitrel+V4?utm\_term=new-balance-womens-dynasoft-nitrel-v4-running-shoes)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/New+Balance+Nitrel+V4?utm_term=new-balance-womens-dynasoft-nitrel-v4-running-shoes"><img alt="new-balance-womens-dynasoft-nitrel-v4-blue-yellow-pink-size-5-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/new-balance-womens-dynasoft-nitrel-v4-blue-yellow-pink-size-5-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a frequent runner, I was intrigued by the New Balance Women's Dynasoft Nitrel V4. The vibrant blue, yellow, and pink color combination made them stand out in my closet. When I started using them, the first thing that caught my attention was the soft and breathable engineered mesh upper. This feature worked wonders for my feet, especially during my early morning runs. 

The AT TREAD outsole provided excellent grip on both pavement and trails, which I couldn't have asked for in a shoe. It was also impressive to see how the DynaSoft cushioning helped absorb impact, making my runs more comfortable and enjoyable. 

One drawback I faced was the shoe's fitting issue. I discovered that the size I ordered was a bit smaller, making the toes feel a bit cramped. As a result, I had to size up, which was a relief. However, I felt the shoes' length could have been a bit longer to accommodate those who need more space. 

Another issue I faced was with the lacing system. It was quite deliberate, but it took some time to lace properly. Additionally, the laces were quite long, which required me to undo them each time I wore the shoes. 

Overall, despite the fitting and lacing issues, the New Balance Women's Dynasoft Nitrel V4 proved to be a comfortable and reliable option for my runs. The vibrant colors, excellent traction, and responsive cushioning made it a worthy addition to my [running gear](https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativesreview.com/blob/main/posts/best/3/Running-Gear.md). With proper sizing in mind, I'd recommend these shoes to other runners looking for a blend of style and performance.

### [New Balance FuelCell SuperComp Elite v4: Race Day Shoe](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/New+Balance+Nitrel+V4?utm\_term=new-balance-fuelcell-supercomp-elite-v4-race-day-shoe)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/New+Balance+Nitrel+V4?utm_term=new-balance-fuelcell-supercomp-elite-v4-race-day-shoe"><img alt="new-balance-mens-fuelcell-supercomp-elite-v4-white-bleached-lime-glo-7-5-d-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/new-balance-mens-fuelcell-supercomp-elite-v4-white-bleached-lime-glo-7-5-d-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try out the New Balance Men's FuelCell SuperComp Elite v4 running shoes, and boy, they definitely delivered on their promise! Not only did they feel incredibly comfortable right out of the box, but they also felt incredibly lightweight, allowing me to move swiftly and effortlessly. The FuelCell midsole technology made with PEBA truly makes a difference, providing that extra energy return that you can really feel in every stride. 

One of the features that stood out to me was the Energy Arc, which paired the sport-specific carbon fiber plate geometry with strategic midsole voids. It really helped with maintaining my momentum while running, especially during longer races or runs where fatigue can set in. The shoe's rocker profile provided a smooth transition from heel to toe, making it feel like a natural extension of my foot. 

However, there was one minor drawback – the outsole didn't seem to be as durable as I would have liked. After a few months of regular use, I noticed the high-wear areas starting to show some wear and tear. Still, considering the overall comfort and performance of the shoes, I think it's a tradeoff I'm willing to make. 

Overall, I'd say the New Balance Men's FuelCell SuperComp Elite v4 running shoes are a solid choice for those looking for a combination of comfort, performance, and that added boost of energy return. They might not be perfect, but they do the job well and make a great addition to any runner's wardrobe.
