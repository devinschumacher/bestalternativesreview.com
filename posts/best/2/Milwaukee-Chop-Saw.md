Recently, I had the chance to try out the Milwaukee Chop Saw (their fancy way of calling it the M18 FUEL Compact Router) for a small project at home. And let me tell you, it was a game-changer. 

This bad boy is designed to cater to professional carpenters and remodelers, and after giving it a shot, I can see why. The 18V Lithium-Ion Brushless motor delivers a power that's usually found in corded saws, without the annoyance of wires. 

The features they've put in there are top-notch too. Adjusting the miter angle was a breeze with their cam locking miter system, and the bevel adjustment lever is an absolute treat to have. Even the detent override lock and chop lock lever are super convenient to use. 

The only downside I found was that it doesn't come with a battery or a charger. But since it runs on Milwaukee's M18 FUEL platform, I already have a battery set I can use, so it wasn't a deal-breaker for me. 

Overall, if you're a serious woodworker or just want a reliable tool that'll get the job done, the Milwaukee Chop Saw is worth checking out.

I especially love the tool-free blade change and fence adjustment, which have saved me a lot of time. The overload indicator light is also quite handy, as it guides me through the optimal cutting speed. However, I did have a slight issue with the weight as I sometimes find it a bit heavy to carry around.

As a professional carpenter, I've been using the M18 FUEL 7-1/4 Dual Bevel Sliding Compound Miter Saw for some time now. What really stands out is its lightweight design, weighing in under 30 pounds. It's a true time-saver when it comes to moving from one jobsite to the next.

That means all-day run-time on just one charge! And don't even get me started on the ease of use - with features like electric brake and keyed blade change, it's no wonder this saw has become a staple in my toolkit. However, one thing I noticed was that the battery charger isn't included - something I wish was mentioned prior to purchase. But overall, it's a solid addition to any carpenter's collection.

The Milwaukee 2739-21HD M18 Fuel 12" Dual Bevel Sliding Compound Miter Saw has been a game-changer in my daily construction tasks. As a seasoned carpenter, I needed a saw that could handle heavy-duty tasks while remaining portable, efficient, and easy to use. The M18 Fuel 2739-21HD has exceeded all of these expectations, and I've found myself turning to it for every project I tackle. 

One of the most impressive features of this miter saw is its Shadow line LED light. This built-in light helps me cut precisely, even in dimly lit areas, and makes it a breeze to line up my cuts before I start sawing. Along with the LED light, the cam locking miter system makes it quick and easy to adjust the angle of the blade, allowing me to switch between various cutting tasks throughout the day with minimal hassle. 

Despite being cordless, the M18 FUEL delivers ample power, thanks to its POWERSTATE brushless motor. The 2739-20 12" M18 Cordless Brushless Miter Saw performs just as well as its corded counterparts, providing the capacity and accurate cuts I need for professional projects. I also appreciate the fact that it's up to 330 cuts per charge, making it a highly efficient and eco-friendly choice. 

One aspect of the M18 FUEL that I wasn't as keen on, however, are the side handles. While they do make carrying the saw easier, they can sometimes get in the way when I'm making precision cuts or adjusting the miter. Additionally, the fact that I need an extra tool to change the blade means I need to be more careful when handling the saw to avoid accidentally damaging the blade or myself. 

Overall, the Milwaukee 2739-21HD M18 Fuel 12" Dual Bevel Sliding Compound Miter Saw has proven to be a reliable and powerful tool, making my daily tasks as a carpenter that much easier. Although there are a few minor flaws, the pros far outweigh the cons in my book, making this saw a worthy investment for any professional in the construction industry.
