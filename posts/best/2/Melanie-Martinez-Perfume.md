### [Parfums De Marly Delina Eau De Parfum Spray - Opulent and Complex Fragrance](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Melanie+Martinez+Perfume?utm\_term=parfums-de-marly-delina-eau-de-parfum-spray-opulent-and-complex-fragrance)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Melanie+Martinez+Perfume?utm_term=parfums-de-marly-delina-eau-de-parfum-spray-opulent-and-complex-fragrance"><img alt="delina-by-parfums-de-marly-2-5-oz-eau-de-parfum-spray-for-women-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/delina-by-parfums-de-marly-2-5-oz-eau-de-parfum-spray-for-women-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

This beauty from Parfums De Marly has captured my heart and senses. It has a truly enticing opening with notes of bergamot, nutmeg, and rhubarb. This delightful scent sets the stage for the beautiful blooms that follow. 

The heart of Delina is a breathtaking bouquet of Turkish rose, incense, cedarwood, and vetiver. These exquisite notes are soft caresses to your senses that I found quite alluring. The combination of the flora and the earthy undertones made it feel like a symphony, a lovely olfactory journey. 

The base notes were a delightful surprise as they reveal an unexpected twist â€” a subtle dash of vanilla, cashmeran, and musk. It's as if the perfume artist decided to add a dash of sugar and spice, making the creation even more captivating. The sweetness of vanilla, the warmth of cashmeran, and the depth of musk created a perfect finish. 

I love the longevity of this fragrance, it stayed with me all day, long after my morning shower. The ease of use is another plus, just a few spritzes and I was set for the day. The scent was never overpowering, just a lovely whisper that followed me around. It was like having my own personal scent, a signature perfume of sorts. 

However, I must mention the price. At this amount, I expected perhaps a larger bottle or at least an extra freebie. The cost can be a deterrent for some. 

But overall, Delina is a stunning creation, one I would recommend to anyone who appreciates luxury perfumes. It's a true testament to the art of fine fragrance. It leaves a memorable impression, an experience that tantalizes your senses and elevates your mood. It transcends the mundane, offering a slice of heaven in a bottle.

I was pleasantly surprised when I first tried this Strawberry Milk perfume inspired by Melanie Martinez's Cry Baby. The blend of fresh milk and ripe strawberries was like a gourmet dessert in a bottle - it was creamy and luxurious. The sweet forest fruits added a playful twist, while the powdery notes and warm caramel undertones gave it an elegant touch. 

This perfume oil spray has become a staple in my daily routine, and I've received many compliments on its unique scent. However, I noticed that it lasts only a few hours, and I wish it could linger for a bit longer.

One of the standout features of this perfume is its longevity â€“ I've had it on for several hours, and the scent still lingers. As a bonus, the clean, vegan, and cruelty-free ingredients make it guilt-free to wear.

### [Melanie Martinez's Signature Eau de Parfum - The Maker Lover](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Melanie+Martinez+Perfume?utm\_term=melanie-martinezs-signature-eau-de-parfum-the-maker-lover)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Melanie+Martinez+Perfume?utm_term=melanie-martinezs-signature-eau-de-parfum-the-maker-lover"><img alt="the-maker-lover-eau-de-parfum-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/the-maker-lover-eau-de-parfum-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The bottle design, inspired by an antique ink flask, is not only thoughtful but also adds a touch of sophistication. I appreciate its use of post-consumer recycled glass and its gender-inclusive nature. The price might be a bit high, but the uniqueness of the scent and the experience make it a worthwhile investment for those who value such aspects in their fragrances.

### [Sweet Floral Scent Perfume from DIME Beauty](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Melanie+Martinez+Perfume?utm\_term=sweet-floral-scent-perfume-from-dime-beauty)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Melanie+Martinez+Perfume?utm_term=sweet-floral-scent-perfume-from-dime-beauty"><img alt="dime-beauty-perfume-i-love-your-smell-baby-sweet-floral-scent-hypoallergenic-clean-perfume-eau-de-to-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/dime-beauty-perfume-i-love-your-smell-baby-sweet-floral-scent-hypoallergenic-clean-perfume-eau-de-to-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Just the other day, I came across the Dime Beauty Perfume called "I Love Your Smell, Baby, Sweet Floral Scent" and thought it sounded like something I'd want to try. The thought of a sweet, clean fragrance intrigued me, and with its hypoallergenic and vegan nature, I felt confident that it would be suitable for my skin. 

I opened the bottle, and the scent was indeed very pleasant, with a slightly sweet and floral aroma. It had a clean feel to it, which was appealing, and the scent strength was just right, not too overpowering. The packaging was also quite attractive, making it a nice addition to my collection. 

However, one downside I noticed was that the scent didn't last as long as I would have hoped. Despite the nice fragrance, it seemed to fade away quite quickly, leaving me to reapply it throughout the day. Additionally, the bottle didn't have the best build quality, as I noticed that it wasn't completely sealed which led to a slight leakage. 

Overall, I enjoyed the Dime Beauty Perfume and appreciated the fact that it was a cruelty-free and vegan product. Although I did experience some drawbacks, I still believe it would be a suitable choice for those who are on the market for a sweet fragrance that's kind to the skin. 


### [Mix:Bar Scent Discovery Set - Luxurious Fragrance Collection](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Melanie+Martinez+Perfume?utm\_term=mix-bar-scent-discovery-set-luxurious-fragrance-collection)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Melanie+Martinez+Perfume?utm_term=mix-bar-scent-discovery-set-luxurious-fragrance-collection"><img alt="mix-bar-scent-discovery-set-1-ea-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mix-bar-scent-discovery-set-1-ea-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When I first heard about the Mix: Bar Scent Discovery Set, I was intrigued by the promise of an affordable way to try out different perfume scents. After a few weeks of using the product, my experience was a mix of highs and lows. 

From the moment I opened the set, the luxurious packaging made me feel like I was dealing with a premium product. Each scent had a unique and inviting label that helped me get a feel of what the fragrance would be like before even trying it on. I loved the diversity of scents - from the fresh Tangerine Squeeze to the cozy Coconut Palm. 

When it came to the performance, the Scent Discovery Set delivered mixed results. The Whipped Almond scent was by far my favorite - it reminded me of a warm, comforting, homemade almond cookie. The Sparkling Hibiscus scent was also a pleasant surprise, with its fruity and playful notes. However, some of the other perfumes didn't have the same staying power. I found that I would have to reapply the Cloud Musk or Coconut Palm several times throughout the day to maintain the scent. 

While I appreciated the fact that the included mix was free from parabens, phthalates, and cruelty, I did feel like the scent strength varied across the set. Overall, this was a great solution for someone looking to sample a variety of fragrances without breaking the bank, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone who wanted to invest in a single fragrance for the long haul.
