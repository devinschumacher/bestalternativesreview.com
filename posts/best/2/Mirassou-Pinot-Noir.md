### [Organic Gaspard Pinot Noir from Loire, France - Lightly Filtered with Indigenous Yeasts](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Mirassou+Pinot+Noir?utm\_term=organic-gaspard-pinot-noir-from-loire-france-lightly-filtered-with-indigenous-yeasts)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Mirassou+Pinot+Noir?utm_term=organic-gaspard-pinot-noir-from-loire-france-lightly-filtered-with-indigenous-yeasts"><img alt="gaspard-pinot-noir-750ml-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/gaspard-pinot-noir-750ml-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Gaspard Pinot Noir, a bottle I recently picked up on a whim, was a revelation. With its grapes hailing from the Loire region in France, it struck me as a unique wine experience. It underwent semi-carbonic fermentation with indigenous yeasts, aged for eight months, and was then lightly filtered before being bottled with minimal sulfur. 

This all contributed to its fine tannins and vibrant black fruit qualities. While it wasn't labeled as organic, just knowing about its natural processes made me appreciate it even more. 

However, the downside for me was the relatively higher price point. But overall, I found it a delightful pour to share with friends.
