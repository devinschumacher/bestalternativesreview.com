### [Fishman Neo-Buster Humbucking Pickup & Feedback Buster](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Fishman+Pickups?utm\_term=fishman-neo-buster-humbucking-pickup-feedback-buster)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Fishman+Pickups?utm_term=fishman-neo-buster-humbucking-pickup-feedback-buster"><img alt="fishman-neo-buster-humbucking-soundhole-pickup-feedback-buster-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fishman-neo-buster-humbucking-soundhole-pickup-feedback-buster-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Fishman Neo-Buster Humbucking Soundhole Pickup is a nifty solution for those looking to reduce unwanted noise and hum while playing their acoustic guitar. With its integrated feedback buster, this pickup is perfect for those loud, high-volume performances. It also boasts neodymium magnets that provide exceptional string balance and incredible acoustic clarity. 

One standout feature of this pickup is its easy assembly, with no need for any modifications on the instrument. Suitable for sound holes with a diameter of approximately 101mm, the Fishman Neo-Buster Humbucking Soundhole Pickup offers an output of 3m cable with a jack plug. 

However, the product does come with a few setbacks. For one, it might not fit all sound holes, and if it doesn't fit snugly, it can be prone to movement. Additionally, it is a passive pickup, which means there are no tone or volume controls. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, the Fishman Neo-Buster Humbucking Soundhole Pickup is still a well-designed and functional pickup that can definitely enhance the performance of an acoustic guitar. Just don't expect perfection with this piece, as some background noise might still be present in certain situations.

One of the standout features for me is the active electronics and neodymium magnet structure, which ensures perfect string balance and crystal-clear acoustic clarity. The miniature batteries conveniently mount on the underside of the pickup, and the batteries are even included â€“ a thoughtful touch. 

Though I've been quite satisfied with the pickup so far, there's always room for improvement. Maybe a more affordable price point could make it accessible to even more musicians. However, the Fishman Rare Earth Bajo Quinto Pickup Earth truly lives up to its reputation and has become an essential part of my daily music-making routine. 


### [Fishman Fluence Signature Series Tim Henson Pickups](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Fishman+Pickups?utm\_term=fishman-fluence-signature-series-tim-henson-pickups)

The Fishman Fluence Signature Series Tim Henson Pickup Set is a game changer for guitarists who are looking to make their electric sound richer and more varied. As I mentioned before, I am really loving this pickup set. It has three distinct voices that are incredibly versatile, allowing me to easily switch between a thick, smooth neck humbucker, a hyper clean tone reminiscent of an acoustic guitar, and a fluid neck single coil. 

One of the things that really stood out to me was how seamlessly these voices blend with each other, making it easy to switch between them mid song. This pickup set is so user-friendly, and they really thought about how guitarists use their instruments on stage. Their clever design allows me to drop these pickups right into my guitar and feel like they've been there all along. 

The rechargeable feature is so convenient as well. Gone are the days when I'd have to make do with a weaker tone because my old batteries have died on stage. These pickups are full of energy and I feel like my sound has never been better. 


### [Fishman Fluence: Killswitch Engage 6-String Pickup Set](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Fishman+Pickups?utm\_term=fishman-fluence-killswitch-engage-6-string-pickup-set)

In my experience, the Fishman Fluence Killswitch Engage pickup set has proven to be a game-changer. I've been using it in my daily life for quite some time now, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in terms of versatility and tone quality. 

One of the highlights of this set is the incredible range of voices it offers. From the most aggressive and powerful voice 1, which is perfect for those brutal solos, to the crystal-clear voice 3 that adds a touch of elegance and fluidity, these pickups truly have something for everyone. 

The volume and tone pots also deserve a mention for their smooth and precise control over the pickup's output. It's been a joy to fine-tune my guitar's sound and achieve the perfect balance for each track I work on. 

However, the push-pull voice selector pot does require a little getting used to. While it provides an additional layer of versatility, it feels a bit clunky at times. I find myself avoiding it most of the time and sticking with the standard volume and tone controls. 

Another minor annoyance is the wiring. While it covers all the necessary components, the lack of a solderless installation option can be frustrating. It adds an extra cost and hassle that you don't expect when purchasing a high-end pickup set. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend the Fishman Fluence Killswitch Engage pickup set to any guitarist looking for versatility and top-notch sound quality. While there are a few minor drawbacks, the pros far outweigh the cons. So go ahead, give these a try, and I promise you won't be disappointed!

One thing I'd like to point out is that, while the pickup didn't require any new tools for installation, I ended up needing a soldering iron to connect it to the preamp.

However, as with every product, there were a couple of downsides. One user mentioned experiencing a loud hissing humming noise, possibly due to a defective pickup. It's always a bummer when that happens, but overall, the positive experiences far outweigh the negatives.

This clever system allows the device to automatically split signal into stereo or sum to mono based on the type of cable used. The 9-Pin output jack ensures a seamless connection between the guitar and amplifier. 

The Powerchip requires a 9V battery for power and boasts a whopping 200 hours of battery life. However, you can also opt for a Fluence rechargeable battery pack if that's more your style. 

Despite its many benefits, the Powerchip does have a few drawbacks. Soldering additional wires onto the device can be quite challenging due to the tiny pads and minuscule wires. This may not be the easiest project for beginners, but with patience and skill, it's definitely doable. 

The 9-Pin jack, while helpful for detecting mono or stereo cables, can be a bit finicky. Some users have reported issues with popping sounds or static when using the device with certain cables. While these problems can be resolved with a few adjustments, it's something to be aware of. 

In terms of sound quality, the Powerchip does make a difference. Guitarists who have used the device have cited improved overall sound quality when combining piezo and electric pickups. However, some users have expressed disappointment in the absence of a physical toggle switch for stereo/mono settings, which could make the process of wiring and adjusting the Powerchip a bit smoother. 

All in all, the Fishman Powerchip is a useful tool for those looking to blend piezo and magnetic pickups in their guitars. While it does require some effort and patience to install, the benefits of improved sound quality are certainly worth it. Just be prepared to deal with a few minor quirks along the way.

And with up to 200+ hours of playing time, it's safe to say these bad boys last a while. 

However, there was one downside that I noticed: the battery life seemed to drain a bit faster than I would have liked. But overall, it was a small inconvenience compared to the incredible sound the set produced. 

In summary, the Fishman Fluence Tosin Abasi 6-String Pickup Set is a fantastic addition to any electric guitar. Its versatility and innovative approach to sound delivery make it a worthy investment for both beginners and seasoned players alike.

The Fishman Fluence Will Adler Signature Set is a game-changer for electric guitarists who demand pristine tone, low noise, and seamless playability. This pickup set is designed in collaboration with Will Adler of the iconic band Lamb of God, and it boasts a set of Fluence pickups that offer a unique take on classic passive and modern active tones. 

The pickups are crafted with an innovative unwound design, which eliminates all the hum and noise commonly associated with wire-wound pickups. They deliver a pure, musical tone that remains uncorrupted by any unwanted interference. The set comprises a Classic neck pickup and a Ceramic bridge pickup hybrid, both of which offer exceptional clarity, definition, and powerful tone. 

The Fluence pickups come with a set of wiring diagrams that are easy to follow, allowing you to create the perfect tone for your playing style. However, one thing to note is that the wiring diagram provided is more suitable for certain Fishman series, which could lead to a slight confusion during installation. 

As for the installation, it may require a bit of extra effort since the set doesn't come with wiring fully compatible with some guitars. The tone selector pots included in the kit might require a small adjustment to fit the required pots of your guitar. Lastly, it is worth mentioning that you might need to replace the long shaft pots with short shaft ones for optimal performance. 

All in all, the Fishman Fluence Will Adler Signature Set delivers an amazing combination of classic and modern tones, all while retaining the utmost clarity and low noise performance that has become the hallmark of the Fishman brand. This pickup set is perfect for high-gain players who seek a raw, dynamic tone, and it's definitely worth considering for any serious guitarist.
