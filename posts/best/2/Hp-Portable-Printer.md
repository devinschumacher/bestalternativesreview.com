With a complete package that included a UK power cable, power supply, and a set of Grade A inks, the HP Officejet H470 quickly became my go-to printer. 

One of the main highlights was the printer's impressive print speeds of up to 22 pages per minute in black and white and up to 18 pages per minute in color. I was able to complete large projects in a fraction of the time compared to other printers I've used. The HP Vivera Ink cartridge was designed for efficiency, and I appreciated the cost savings since these inks last longer than most competitors' inks. 

Another standout feature was its USB and PictBridge connections, which allowed me to quickly and easily print a wide range of files. The mobile printing capabilities were a lifesaver, as I could work on my projects on the go without having to wait for a print room or set up a messy desktop printer at home. 

However, there were a couple of drawbacks to consider. The printer lacked wireless connectivity, which could be a dealbreaker for some users. Additionally, ink cartridges can be quite expensive, so be prepared to invest in this aspect of the printer. 

Despite these cons, the HP OfficeJet H470 Mobile Inkjet Printer proved to be reliable, efficient, and perfect for my needs. Whether you need a printer for work or play, this compact and portable option is definitely worth considering.
