<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Instant+Pot+3qt?utm_term=compact-3qt-instant-pot-duo-mini-small-size-big-performance"><img alt="instant-pot-duo-mini-7-in-1-3qt-electric-pressure-cooker-silver-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/instant-pot-duo-mini-7-in-1-3qt-electric-pressure-cooker-silver-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Instant Pot 3qt Condensation Water Collector](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Instant+Pot+3qt?utm\_term=instant-pot-3qt-condensation-water-collector)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Instant+Pot+3qt?utm_term=instant-pot-3qt-condensation-water-collector"><img alt="condensation-water-collector-works-with-instant-pot-duo-mini-3-qt-duo-plus-mini-3-qt-duo-nova-ultra--1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/condensation-water-collector-works-with-instant-pot-duo-mini-3-qt-duo-plus-mini-3-qt-duo-nova-ultra--1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I remember the day when I finally got my hands on an Instant Pot. It instantly became my kitchen's best friend, making cooking a breeze. However, like any other kitchen appliance, it had one minor issue - condensation. And that's when this condensation water collector came to the rescue. 

With this little helper, I no longer have to worry about the soggy mess that used to accumulate on my countertop. It's simple, easy to use, and most importantly, fits perfectly with my Instant Pot Duo Mini 3 Qt. I love how it's designed to perfection, allowing me to enjoy the benefits of my pressure cooker without any hassle. 

However, it's not all sunshine and roses. I have noticed that for other models of Instant Pot, a larger water collector might be necessary. Also, it doesn't fit all models, so it's crucial to double-check before making a purchase. 

Despite these minor setbacks, this replacement has made my old pressure cooker work like new. It's dishwasher safe, but I'm more of a manual cleaner, so it's a non-issue for me. Plus, it's compact, measuring at 3 x 1.9 x 0.5 inches, making it easy to store away when not in use. 

In conclusion, the condensation water collector for the Instant Pot is a lifesaver for those who want to keep their kitchen countertops dry and enjoy the convenience of their pressure cooker without the condensation issues. 


### [Instant Pot 3qt 7.5 Qt Multicooker and Slow Cooker Set](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Instant+Pot+3qt?utm\_term=instant-pot-3qt-7-5-qt-multicooker-and-slow-cooker-set)

I recently got my hands on the Instant Superior 7.5 qt Chef Series Multicooker, and it has genuinely revolutionized my cooking game. What stood out the most to me was its versatility. With this chef-worthy creation, my slow cook and sear functionalities are always just an arm's length away. The pre-set temperature settings make it a walk in the park to create mouth-watering recipes, and the control buttons are user-friendly, even for someone like me who's not tech-savvy. 

That being said, there was a bit of a hiccup here. The non-stick pot, while convenient in other ways, left a lot to be desired. I found that cleaning it was a bit of a process. After every use, it would end up looking rather grimy, despite my best efforts at hand washing it. I found myself trying to figure out how to coax the non-stick coating to cooperate, which wasn't exactly a pleasure. 

Apart from that, I must say that the Instant Superior Chef Series Multicooker has turned into my go-to kitchen appliance. Its deep and flavorful meals have earned it a prime spot in my kitchen, making it a worthwhile investment. The dishwasher-safe glass lid and ceramic-coated non-stick cooking pot are a significant plus, helping to save time and energy during the clean-up process. All in all, it's a powerful and efficient kitchen tool with a lot to offer.

The stainless steel handle and lid knob are well-made, providing a comfortable grip, and the lid fits snugly on the pot, ensuring there's no heat escape. 

I used this lid for both slow cooking and sautéing and found the clear glass made it much easier to monitor the progress of my dishes. The lid can also be safely used in the oven up to 428F (220C), eliminating the need for an additional oven-safe lid. 

One drawback I encountered was that the lid is dishwasher safe, but it doesn't fit perfectly in the dishwasher. I had to manually clean it, which wasn't a major hassle, but it would have been more convenient if it fit in the dishwasher. 

Overall, the Instant Pot Tempered Glass Lid is a fantastic accessory for any Instant Pot user. Its clear glass and easy-to-clean design make it a great addition to your kitchen, and its versatility ensures it's a worthwhile investment for any home cook.

### [Instant Pot Lux 8qt Multifunction Programmable Pressure Cooker](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Instant+Pot+3qt?utm\_term=instant-pot-lux-8qt-multifunction-programmable-pressure-cooker)

I purchased the Instant Pot Lux 8-quart Multi-Use Programmable Pressure Cooker, eager to experience the convenience and speed it promised. After a few weeks of cooking with it, I have to say the hype is well-earned. 

One of the main highlights of this device is its versatility. I can use it as a pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice cooker, steamer, sauté/browning pan, and warmer. The micro-processor controls 10 programs which are amazingly adjustable in temperature and cooking time. And, don't forget about the inner pot! It's ceramic and dishwasher-safe, featuring a non-stick interior coating that's PTFE and PFOA-free. 

However, there were also a few drawbacks I encountered. While the cooker comes with a delay start and keep warm function, the user interface could use some improvements. Navigating through the different functions and settings can be a bit confusing at first. 

Additionally, the delay start feature requires a manual intervention to release the pressure, which some users might find inconvenient. Also, the lid handle could be a bit smaller for easier handling. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I'm really enjoying cooking with my Instant Pot Lux. Its ability to speed up cooking, the variety of options it offers, and its ease of use make it an invaluable addition to my kitchen appliances. Plus, cleaning it is a breeze thanks to the dishwasher-safe parts it comes with.

It also made for a much cleaner and safer experience. The capacity of this cooker is great for feeding up to 6 people, making it ideal for hosting guests or meal prepping for the week. However, the 6-quart size might be a bit too large for small families or individuals who don't need to cook large portions.

Cleaning the appliance was surprisingly easy, with only a few parts that needed to be rinsed or washed. The durability of the materials used is also commendable, as they seemed sturdy and long-lasting. 

The only downside I encountered was that the pressure cook mode was a bit confusing at first, and it took some practice to get the timing right. Additionally, I found that the cooker took quite a long time (about 40-45 minutes) to vent after cooking, which could be frustrating for someone in a hurry. 

Overall, the Instant Pot Rio Chef Series is a great addition to any kitchen, especially for busy families or individuals who value convenience and versatility. It has been a daily use item in my home, and I highly recommend trying it out.
