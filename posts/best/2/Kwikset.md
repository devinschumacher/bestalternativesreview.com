### [Kwikset Polo Privacy Satin Nickel Lock Set](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Kwikset?utm\_term=kwikset-polo-privacy-satin-nickel-lock-set)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Kwikset?utm_term=kwikset-polo-privacy-satin-nickel-lock-set"><img alt="kwikset-polo-privacy-satin-nickel-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/kwikset-polo-privacy-satin-nickel-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently upgraded my interior bedroom door with Kwikset Polo's Privacy Satin Nickel knobs, replacing the old brass ones. The modern satin nickel finish perfectly complemented my room's aesthetic. The locking mechanism functioned smoothly, and the door unlocked simply by turning the interior knob. 

Installing these knobs was a breeze; I didn't even need a Philips screwdriver! The adjustable backset allowed them to fit perfectly with just a screwdriver. The inclusion of the full lip round strike made the installation process even easier. Not only do they look great, but I also appreciate the peace of mind that comes with the ANSI/BHMA grade 3 certification. 

However, what disappointed me was the quality of the outside knob. The latch felt cheap, and both the inside and outside knobs had quite a bit of wobble, which does not instill confidence in the product's durability. Moreover, the plastic spindle could potentially wear out prematurely, which is a bit disheartening after spending money on this set. 

Overall, the Kwikset Polo Privacy Satin Nickel knobs provided a stylish upgrade to my bedroom door. The adjustable backset and easy installation process are definite pros, but the lack of durability and potential for premature wear of the plastic spindle are definite cons.

I got my hands on the Kwikset Contemporary SmartCode Electronic Deadbolt in Venetian Bronze, and let me tell you, it looks absolutely stunning in my entrance. I could rant about the smartkey technology and the back-lit keypad, but I'll save that for another day. 

What I loved the most about this lock was its sleek design. You step up to designer styles and superior security with this beauty, and let me tell you, it's a true game-changer for people struggling with lost keys. 

As someone who's constantly forgetting where I left my keys, I found the personalized code feature to be a life changer. The one-touch locking and un-locking action made it effortless to use, not to mention, the Venetian Bronze finish added an elegant touch to its style. 

However, installation was a bit of a headache initially. Despite the straightforward description, I had to replace three tiny screws that kept falling out. But once I got past that hurdle, everything else was smooth sailing. 

Overall, I'd say this lock is worth your time if you're looking for a reliable, stylish, and keyless entry solution. Now, if only they could work on those screws!
