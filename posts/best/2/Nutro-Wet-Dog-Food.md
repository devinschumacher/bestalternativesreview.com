The primary difference between Nutro Wet and Dry Dog Food lies in their texture and moisture content. Wet dog food typically contains around 78% moisture, while dry dog food contains only 10-12% moisture. Wet dog food is generally simpler for dogs to digest, as the moisture content aids in softening the food and minimizes the risk of dehydration.

Dry dog food has a longer shelf life, making it more user-friendly for pet owners. It also supports dental health, as the kibble helps eliminate plaque from a dog's teeth. The choice between Nutro Wet and Dry Dog Food depends on your dog's preferences, dietary needs, and the ease of feeding them.


### How much Nutro Wet Dog Food should I feed my dog?

The feeding amount for Nutro Wet Dog Food is contingent on several factors, such as your dog's age, size, activity level, and overall health. As a general guideline, start with feeding your dog 1-2% of their body weight per day, then adjust the quantity as needed based on their body condition and energy levels.

Keep a watchful eye on your dog's weight and adjust their food intake to maintain a healthy weight. Overfeeding can lead to obesity and various health issues. Consult your veterinarian if you have concerns about your dog's weight or nutritional requirements. They can offer personalized advice and recommendations based on your dog's specific needs.


### How long can I store an unopened container of Nutro Wet Dog Food?

An unopened container of Nutro Wet Dog Food can be stored in a cool, dry location, following the packaging instructions. The food can typically last up to six months from the date of manufacture. To maintain its quality and freshness, keep it away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures.

If you suspect that the food has spoiled, discard the unrefrigerated contents of the container after two hours. Once opened, refrigerate the unused portion and use it within three days. Proper storage and service of Nutro Wet Dog Food ensure that your dog receives a high-quality, nutritious meal.
