### How should I maintain my shelved file cabinet to ensure its longevity?

To maintain the longevity of your shelved file cabinet, follow proper care and maintenance practices. Regularly clean the cabinet's exterior and interior surfaces using a mild detergent and water solution. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or harsh chemicals, as these can damage the finish or components of the unit. It's also crucial to lubricate the file drawer tracks periodically to prevent them from becoming stiff and difficult to move. Most manufacturers recommend using a silicone-based lubricant for this purpose. Ensure that you do not over-lubricate, as excessive lubrication can attract dirt and dust, leading to reduced performance over time. By following these maintenance practices, you can help ensure that your shelved file cabinet remains in good working condition and serves you well for years to come.
