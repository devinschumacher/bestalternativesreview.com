### [Micro Trauma Kit Now Plus - Coyote](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Molle+Med+Kit?utm\_term=micro-trauma-kit-now-plus-coyote)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Molle+Med+Kit?utm_term=micro-trauma-kit-now-plus-coyote"><img alt="blue-force-gear-micro-trauma-kit-now-plus-coyote-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blue-force-gear-micro-trauma-kit-now-plus-coyote-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the opportunity to try out the Blue Force Gear Micro Trauma Kit Now Plus in Coyote, and I must say, it's a game-changer for any adventurous soul. Not only is it 30% larger than the original version, but it's designed to fit a full-size pressure dressing and chest seal. The kit comes with a MOLLE med kit mount for easy attachment to various gear, and the high speed access to medical supplies is a true lifesaver. 

While some might argue that the size of the kit is a bit bulkier, I personally found it to be incredibly useful during my outdoor excursions. The ten-speed military-grade elastic and helium-whisper fabric make it a durable option for any scenario. With the ability to quickly detach the inner med pouch shingle, accessing the contents of the kit is a breeze. 

However, I will admit that the absence of medical supplies in the kit is a bit of a letdown. Nonetheless, I can't deny the convenience and functionality of this little pouch. It's perfect for those who want to be prepared for emergencies on the go and need a reliable, sturdy companion for their medical gear. 

Overall, I'm quite impressed with the Blue Force Gear Micro Trauma Kit Now Plus. It's a well-designed, versatile option for anyone looking to have a little extra peace of mind in the great outdoors. 


### [EVERLIT Survival IFAK Molle System First Aid Kit](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Molle+Med+Kit?utm\_term=everlit-survival-ifak-molle-system-first-aid-kit)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Molle+Med+Kit?utm_term=everlit-survival-ifak-molle-system-first-aid-kit"><img alt="everlit-250-pieces-survival-first-aid-kit-ifak-molle-system-compatible-outdoor-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/everlit-250-pieces-survival-first-aid-kit-ifak-molle-system-compatible-outdoor-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

EverLit's 250-piece Survival First Aid Kit truly stands out as a trustworthy companion for any situation that may arise during outdoor activities or everyday life. I've been using this kit for quite some time, and it never disappoints. 

One of the aspects I truly appreciate is its Molle Compatibility. This has made it incredibly convenient for me to attach my kit to my backpack or vest during extended trips into the wilderness. Such versatility is especially useful when you're constantly on the move, from camping to hiking or hunting adventures. Having all these supplies readily available means I no longer have to worry about having a basic first aid kit and essential survival gadgets with me at all times. 

The quality of the kit is quite impressive. With its military-grade, water-resistant 1000D nylon construction, it's built to withstand the wear and tear of rugged outdoor conditions. The large compartments within the bag make organizing my supplies a breeze, allowing me to quickly access what I need when I need it. Additionally, having it conveniently attachable to any Molle system adds to its portability, further enhancing usability. 

Its contents exceed expectations in terms of comprehensiveness, surpassing even OSHA guidelines. Despite my initial concerns that the kit might be slightly bulky, I discovered that the space-saving organization was quite efficient and compact. 

However, there are moments where some items within the kit may seem a bit redundant or inapplicable. The Flintstone, for example, isn't necessarily a critical component for most people—at least not where I live. Nevertheless, this might be a different case in other geographic locations or when used in survival situations. 

Some users have suggested including clearer instructions for certain medical situations, or a quick guide on how to use all the items available for treatment. Although this may seem like an understandably minor addition, having clear and simple instructions can go a long way in ensuring efficient utilization of the kit during urgent times. 

In conclusion, despite having faced a few minor challenges, the overall experience using EverLit’s Survival First Aid Kit has been quite enjoyable and beneficial. It has truly enhanced my outdoor safety preparations and provides me with a sense of assurance that I'm well prepared in case of any emergencies. Overall, I'm happy to recommend it to anyone seeking a reliable yet comprehensive first aid kit for outdoor activities.

One of its best features is that it's designed with water-resistant and lightweight materials, which means you can have it with you anywhere without worrying about damaging your kit. 

Inside this small yet mighty bag, you'll find all the essential trauma-specific items you need to handle emergencies, such as different sizes of bandages and gauze, a tourniquet, a trauma dressing, and even a trauma shears. The added bonus of MOLLE on the front makes it easy to attach to other bags or gear, making it a versatile part of your everyday carry. 

While I did find the kit quite useful in my everyday life, there were a few aspects I wish were different. For instance, it could be more suitable for people of various sizes, as some users have mentioned that it's a bit too bulky for a comfortable carry. Additionally, while the kit is packed with essentials, it would be great if it could include more everyday items like band-aids for minor cuts or burns. 

All in all, the My Medic Everyday Carry Kit (EDC Coyote) is a valuable addition to any first aid kit, especially if you're constantly on the go. While it may have some limitations, the convenience it offers and the essential trauma items it contains make it a worthwhile investment for those who want to be prepared.

The variety of items available covered almost any potential emergency situation, making me feel confident and prepared for whatever the day might bring. 

However, the kit also had its downsides. Some of the survival tools included felt redundant or impractical for everyday use.
