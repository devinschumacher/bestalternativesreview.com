### [Grandstream GXP1625 IP Phone: Reliable VoIP Solution for Small Businesses](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Grandstream+Phones?utm\_term=grandstream-gxp1625-ip-phone-reliable-voip-solution-for-small-businesses)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Grandstream+Phones?utm_term=grandstream-gxp1625-ip-phone-reliable-voip-solution-for-small-businesses"><img alt="grandstream-gxp1625-ip-phone-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/grandstream-gxp1625-ip-phone-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a small business owner, I've had the chance to use the Grandstream GXP1625 IP Phone for a few weeks now. This little phone packs a punch with advanced features that make communication within the office a breeze. 

One aspect that stood out to me is the full HD audio quality on both speaker and handset. Every call is crystal clear, without any pesky static or echoes. The design is modern and sleek—perfect for sitting on my desk right next to my computer. 

However, there is one downside that I've noticed. The phone's weight is quite substantial, weighing in at 3 pounds. It might not be the most comfortable to hold for an extended period, but it sure looks stylish sitting on the desk. 

In terms of functionality, it offers support for up to 2 lines and 3-way conferencing. The built-in Poe is a great plus, especially if your desk space is limited. [The EHS support for Plantronics headsets makes wearing a headset comfy and efficient.](https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativereviews.com/https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativesreview.com/blob/main/posts/best/3/Plantronics-Headset.md) 

One thing that surprised me is the phone's state-of-the-art security encryption technology (SRTP and TLS). It's reassuring to know that my conversations are secure and private. 

The only drawback I've encountered during my testing phase is the placement of the Ethernet cable. It's located below the phone, making it challenging to keep straight on a flat surface. This can be a bit frustrating, but overall, the phone's pros outweigh the cons. 

In conclusion, the Grandstream GXP1625 is a reliable and feature-packed IP phone for small business owners. It delivers the best in VoIP communication, and I recommend it without hesitation.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Grandstream+Phones?utm_term=grandstream-gxp2160-enterprise-ip-telephone-for-hd-voice-and-advanced-features"><img alt="grandstream-gs-gxp2160-enterprise-ip-telephone-voip-phone-and-device-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/grandstream-gs-gxp2160-enterprise-ip-telephone-voip-phone-and-device-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a VOIP enthusiast, I've had the pleasure of using and setting up a range of VOIP phones, and I must say, the Grandstream GXP2160 is among my top choices. Its ease of setup, coupled with the excellent headset audio and build quality, make it a solid choice for any enterprise.

The HD audio is crisp and clear, keeping call quality at an impressive level. And the vibrant color display adds visual appeal, making it a great addition to a corporate desk. 

Setting up the device takes just a few minutes, thanks to the intuitive web GUI which is pretty straightforward and similar to other GXP series phones. The phone also boasts dual gigabit ethernet jacks, providing a seamless connection to your PC without any major performance issues. 

However, there are a few drawbacks to this phone that I believe cannot be ignored. The headset jack, though functional, can be quite erratic, requiring you to plug in the headset at the handset jack to ensure it works. This can be a significant inconvenience for those that need a headset for their phone. 

Another issue I found was with the phone book. It simply doesn't make sense to include a phonebook directory on a single-use device like this. Instead, the function of a phonebook should be integrated into the programmed speed dials or computer-assisted calls. 

The button layout leaves something to be desired as well. The handset, headset, and speakerphone are not laid out together, which can be confusing for users. Lastly, the handset cable spot could have been better engineered, as it oftentimes results in the phone tilting due to the cable getting stuck under the edge. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, the Grandstream GXP2160 remains a reliable and user-friendly VoIP phone for most users, offering plenty of features at a reasonable price.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Grandstream+Phones?utm_term=grandstream-wp810-portable-wifi-phone-with-2-sip-accounts-and-6-hour-talk-time"><img alt="grandstream-wp810-portable-wifi-phone-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/grandstream-wp810-portable-wifi-phone-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The best feature that stands out is the HD voice quality, which is impressive for a portable device. It also comes with a dual MIC design and Noise Shield Technology, ensuring that my calls are always clear and free of background noise. 

One downside I discovered is that the battery life may not be optimal for heavy users. With a 1500mAh rechargeable battery, the talk time is rated at 6 hours, which isn't bad, but it could be better. Another minor issue is the provisioning - it can be a bit tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's not too bad. 

Overall, I've enjoyed using the WP810 for its easy setup and convenient, portable design. It's a great alternative to a traditional cell phone, and I would recommend it for those looking for a reliable WiFi-enabled device for their communication needs.
