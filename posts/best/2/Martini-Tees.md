### [Martini Tee Golf Tees: Improve Distance and Accuracy](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Martini+Tees?utm\_term=martini-tee-golf-tees-improve-distance-and-accuracy)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Martini+Tees?utm_term=martini-tee-golf-tees-improve-distance-and-accuracy"><img alt="martini-tee-golf-tees-5-pack-aqua-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/martini-tee-golf-tees-5-pack-aqua-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Martini Tee for quite some time now, and I must say, it's a game-changer on the golf course. My wife and I love that these tees are made in the USA because we're all about supporting local businesses. 

One of my favorite things about the Martini Tee is how easy it is to tee the ball up. Before these tees, I would struggle to get a solid placement and often waste time fiddling with the ball at the tee. But now with these, it's a breeze. 

They've also made a significant difference in the distance and straightness of my drives. The larger cup allows me to tilt the ball forward towards my target, just as advertised. It's as if the ball wants to roll itself towards the hole! 

Another feature I appreciate is their durability. I've seen some golfers break tees every round, but that's not a worry with the Martini Tee. They've lasted me a very long time, even if I forget to retrieve them after a good shot! 

One minor downside is the cost. While there's no denying the quality of the tees, they might be a bit on the pricier side, especially since they're considered a gimmick by some. Nonetheless, for the benefits and convenience they provide, I still think they're worth it. 

Overall, the Martini Tee is a fun, functional product that has made my golfing experience much more enjoyable. It's a great combination of style, practicality, and local pride.

I had the chance to try out a pack of Martini Golf Tees, and I must say, they did not disappoint! I've always struggled with using traditional wooden tees, and these Martini Tees made a noticeable difference in my game. 

Firstly, the size of the tees is perfect for today's larger club heads. They've been designed with a large cup that allows for easy tilting of the ball, giving you straighter, longer drives. The proprietary polymer resin used in these tees really does make them last much longer than wooden ones. It's nice to only have to buy a new pack once in a while. 

The stability provided by these tees is great, and it's one of the features that made me fall in love with them. No more losing balance or struggling to keep the ball on the tee. And as someone who tends to forget things, it's great that they last so long! 

However, I do think the price is a bit on the high side. $30 for a pack of 4 is a lot to spend on golf tees. But if you're serious about your game and want to make your game easier, I'd definitely recommend investing in a pack of Martini Tees. They could be the game-changer you've been looking for! 


### [Martini Tees Mini Shaker - 12 Pack](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Martini+Tees?utm\_term=martini-tees-mini-shaker-12-pack)

I had the chance to use these Martini Tees for a round of golf recently, and I must say, they were quite the experience. These tees are made from a durable polymer resin blend that makes them virtually unbreakable, which was great to find out when I accidentally hit it with my foot!

The Martini Tees also stood out for their height, being longer than traditional tees. This made for better stability, even on tricky terrain. 

I was pleasantly surprised by both the durability and functionality of these golf tees. However, I would be cautious of using them for iron shots - they seemed to interfere with the ball's spin or trajectory, which is a minor drawback compared to the overall product performance. 

Overall, if you're looking for stylish and practical golf tees that deliver performance and unmatched stability, the Martini Tees are worth giving a try!

These tees are a full 3.25 inches tall and come with a built-in stop at 1.75 inches, perfect for accommodating today's big drivers. One of the things that immediately stood out to me was their durability. Made from a proprietary polymer resin blend, these tees are designed to last a lot longer than traditional wooden tees. The stop at 1.75 inches was especially helpful, as it allowed for consistency in my ball's positioning, giving me a more accurate shot every time. 

Despite their sturdy construction, I was initially concerned about the size and weight of the tees. However, once I started using them, I found that they were actually quite lightweight and easy to carry in my golf bag. The larger cup also made it easier to place the ball on the tee and provided better grip for swinging. I also appreciated the fun red color, which made it easier to spot when tees went flying during my matches. 

In terms of drawbacks, I did find that some of my friends who used different types of golf tees found it more difficult to transition to these Martini ones. They mentioned that the higher step-up height took some getting used to, and they had a bit of trouble adjusting their swings accordingly. Additionally, some friends who received the tees as gifts were not as confident in their performance, as they felt that the tees required a certain level of technical skill to achieve optimal results. 

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the Martini Step-Up Golf Tees. They offered excellent durability and consistency, and the built-in step made it easy to get the ball in the right position.
