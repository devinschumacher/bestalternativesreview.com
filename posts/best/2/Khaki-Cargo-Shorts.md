[As a man who loves outdoor adventures, I recently gave the Bimini Bay Outback Men's Cotton Shorts a try.](https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativereviews.com/https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativesreview.com/blob/main/posts/best/2/Mens-Jersey-Shorts.md) The first thing that stood out to me was the impressive rear elastic waistband, making these shorts incredibly comfortable to wear even after hours of hiking. I also appreciated the seven pockets, including a useful rear tool pocket, which provided ample storage for snacks, maps, and other essentials. 

The beige color and khaki fabric are perfect for the outdoors, and the Bimini Bay woven label on the front pocket and logo horn button made these shorts stand out as a premium brand. The 7 1/2-inch inseam was also just right for my height, providing the perfect length while keeping me cool on warmer days. 

However, during my recent trip, I encountered an unfortunate issue with sizing. The online shop did not ask for my size when I placed the order, leading to an unsuitable fit. I found this rather inconvenient, especially since the inventory depends on the size the customer wants. 

Despite this minor drawback, I must say that overall, the Bimini Bay Outback Men's Cotton Shorts are a great choice for any guy venturing into the great outdoors. Their premium quality and comfortable fit make them my go-to shorts for future adventures.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Khaki+Cargo+Shorts?utm_term=kuhl-men-s-ambush-khaki-cargo-shorts-versatile-outdoor-wear"><img alt="kuhl-men-s-ambush-cargo-short-khaki-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/kuhl-men-s-ambush-cargo-short-khaki-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been on quite a few hikes and camping trips in the past few months, and I've been searching for a pair of shorts that could handle all the action without showing any signs of wear and tear. That's when I stumbled upon these KUHL Men's Ambush Cargo Shorts in Khaki. At first glance, they seemed like your typical cargo shorts, but upon closer inspection, I noticed that they were made of a blend of cotton, nylon, and spandex, which made me curious about their durability. 

I tried them on and was pleasantly surprised by their fit. They had just the right amount of give to stretch without feeling too loose, and they weren't too tight either. I liked that the inseam length options were 8 inches, 10 inches, and 12 inches, which allowed me to choose the perfect length for my legs. The pockets were another feature that stood out to me. There were two hand pockets, two zippered cargo pockets in the back, and a secure zip pocket in the front, giving me plenty of storage space for all my essentials. 

As I was testing them out on the trails, I noticed that the KÜHLair vent system and quick-drying fabric kept me feeling fresh and comfortable. Even in the warmest climates, these shorts didn't leave me feeling sticky or uncomfortable. I was particularly impressed with the ventilation, as it allowed for constant airflow to keep my legs dry and cool during my hikes. 

However, there were a couple of things that I noticed didn't live up to my expectations. The button on the waistband seemed a little flimsy, and on occasion, it would come undone when I bent over. It wasn't a huge issue, but it was something that I noticed. Additionally, the zip pocket in the front didn't seem to be large enough to fit my wallet and keys at the same time. It was a bit of a squeeze, and I had to choose which items to store in there. 

Overall, I'm happy with the KUHL Men's Ambush Cargo Shorts in Khaki. They're made with great materials, provide plenty of storage, and have a comfortable fit. While they weren't perfect, I still believe they're worth the investment for anyone looking for a versatile pair of shorts that can handle all kinds of outdoor adventures.
