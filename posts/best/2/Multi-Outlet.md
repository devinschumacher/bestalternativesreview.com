<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Multi+Outlet?utm_term=avolt-328445-square-2-wall-socket-with-usb-c-port-pale-green"><img alt="avolt-square-2-wall-socket-with-usb-c-port-pale-green-328446" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/avolt-square-2-wall-socket-with-usb-c-port-pale-green-328446/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who has been using the Square 2 for a couple of weeks now, I must say, it's been a game-changer for me and my home. I've always struggled with tangled cords in my kitchen, but now, with Square 2, I have a sleek and stylish solution that keeps my counters clutter-free. 

The first thing that caught my eye was its minimalist design. The pale green finish adds a touch of elegance to my kitchen, and it seamlessly blends in with the rest of my decor. The Square 2's shape and magnetic base keep it anchored firmly on the wall, so I don't have to worry about it falling off. 

One of the highlights for me is the inclusion of two USB-C ports, which are incredibly convenient. I can charge my phone, tablet, and even my laptop without having to reach for multiple chargers. The 30W of charging power is more than enough to keep everything charged up, and it works brilliantly. 

However, I do have a few small quibbles. For starters, I wish there were more USB ports available. I'd love an option with more F sockets for all my daily devices, not just the ones with USB-C attachments. Additionally, the price point is higher than what I usually pay for wall sockets, but I do believe you get what you pay for – the quality and design make it worth the splurge. 

All in all, I'm really happy with the Square 2, and it's become an indispensable part of my home. Its minimalist design, powerful charging capabilities, and magnetic base are all features that make it stand out from other wall sockets on the market. If you're looking for a sleek and stylish charging solution for your home, give this one a try – you won't be disappointed.

The included TVS, MOV, and GDT circuits not only safeguard against power surges but also ensure a steady supply of electricity. 

However, there is a small downside, as the USB-C port does not support charging for laptops like MacBook models. Nonetheless, the USB-A ports come in handy for charging smartphones and tablets, and the maximum output of 5V/2.4A per USB-A port is more than enough for my daily needs.

### [Space-Saving Pop-Up Outlet with Multi Outlets and USB Ports for Countertops and Workspaces](https://serp.ly/amazon/Multi+Outlet?utm\_term=space-saving-pop-up-outlet-with-multi-outlets-and-usb-ports-for-countertops-and-workspaces)

One of the best features, though, is its ease of use. Installation is a breeze, and the outlets and USB ports pop up when I need them and seamlessly disappear when I don't. And the six-foot cord makes it easy to position it anywhere without having to worry about finding a nearby outlet. 

Of course, nothing's perfect, and the only minor drawback is that it does require a hole to be cut in your desk or counter-top, which could be a bit daunting for some.

## Buyer's Guide

Multi outlet strips, also known as power strips, come in various forms, ranging from basic models to advanced ones with numerous features. When shopping for a multi outlet, it is essential to consider certain factors that can significantly impact your overall experience and satisfaction. Here is a comprehensive guide to help you make the right decision. 


### Power Rating

The power rating of a multi outlet indicates how much power it can provide safely. This information is important when you plan to use multiple high-power devices simultaneously. Look for a power rating that is appropriate for your needs, ensuring the multi outlet can handle the combined power consumption of all connected devices without overloading or causing damage. 


### Number of Outlets

The number of outlets on a multi outlet can vary significantly. Consider the number of devices you need to plug in simultaneously, and choose a multi outlet with the appropriate number of outlets. For smaller setups, a basic 4-6 outlet model might suffice, but for more complex configurations, you might need something with up to 15 or even more outlets. 


### Surge Protection

Surge protection is a critical feature for a multi outlet, especially in areas where power surges or voltage spikes are common. Look for a multi outlet with built-in surge protection to safeguard your connected devices from potential damage. Check the surge protection rating (usually in joules) to ensure it can handle expected voltage fluctuations. 


### Design and Accessibility

The design of a multi outlet can influence its ease of use and accessibility. Look for a model with outlets arranged in a way that allows for easy access to all ports, especially if you plan to use larger or heavier devices. Additionally, consider the overall design and size of the multi outlet, ensuring it complements your workspace and does not take up unnecessary space. 


## FAQ


### What is a multi outlet and how does it function?

A multi outlet is an innovative device that permits multiple appliances or gadgets to be connected to a solitary socket. It operates by featuring distinct individual power sockets or USB ports on a single panel, facilitating the concurrent charging or powering of multiple devices without requiring additional outlets. This proves particularly beneficial in settings necessitating the simultaneous charging of multiple devices, saving both space and time.

A typical feature of these devices is the inclusion of a power switch or toggle, enabling users to switch all sockets on or off at once. Some models may also offer extra features, such as surge protection or a built-in USB port designed for charging devices requiring such power source. The multi outlets are adaptable and versatile, commonly being utilized in residential, commercial, and portable contexts.


### How many sockets should a multi outlet include?

The number of sockets incorporated in a multi outlet can range from two to eighteen or more, contingent upon the model and requirements. The optimal quantity of sockets needed is contingent upon the user's specific needs. For those planning to charge only two or three devices at once, a 4-6 socket multi outlet may be sufficient. However, for those requiring power for numerous devices simultaneously, a larger 10-16 or more socket multi outlet may be more appropriate.

It is essential to consider the size and weight of the device, as larger models with more sockets can be heavier and occupy more space. Hence, it is crucial to select a multi outlet that harmoniously balances convenience and portability with the requisite number of sockets for the devices being used.


### Are multi outlets secure to use?

When utilized correctly, multi outlets are a secure option. Nevertheless, certain precautions should be undertaken to guarantee safety during use. Always opt for a multi outlet featuring surge protection to prevent device damage caused by sudden voltage surges. Moreover, avoid overloading the sockets and refrain from utilizing more power adapters or devices than the multi outlet is capable of handling. Overloading can lead to overheating, potentially triggering an electrical fire.

Should the multi outlet exhibit signs of damage or appear faulty, replace promptly. Constantly unplug the device when not in use and position the multi outlet in a convenient yet water-free location. By adhering to these safety guidelines, proper usage of the multi outlet can be ensured.


### How can I determine the suitable multi outlet for my needs?

When seeking a multi outlet, contemplate the following aspects: the required number of sockets, size and weight constraints, additional features like surge protection and USB ports, and any aesthetic preferences. Opting for a multi outlet catering to your specific needs will provide convenience without jeopardizing safety. The size and weight must align with storage or transportation requirements, and features like surge protection can enhance device protection. Lastly, if the multi outlet's design complements your space, consider its appearance as well.

Examine reviews and contrast various models to form a better understanding of available options. While a larger multi outlet may seem more practical, it may not always be the most suitable fit for particular needs. Devote time to selecting the ideal multi outlet to guarantee safety and proper functioning of devices.


### Can a multi outlet be utilised outdoors?

Although most multi outlets are designed for indoor use, outdoor-rated multi outlets are available in the market. These devices boast unique safety features and weather-resistant materials, safeguarding against moisture and extreme temperatures. If an outdoor multi outlet is necessary, ensure selection of a device specifically engineered for outdoor usage.

Practice safety guidelines when employing a multi outlet outdoors. This includes keeping the device away from water sources and ensuring secure installation to prevent accidental damage or falls. Outdoor multi outlets should ideally be positioned on a dry, level surface and sport a weather-resistant coating for protection against environmental elements.


### What advantages do multi outlets provide?

A multi outlet presents numerous benefits, chief among which is its flexibility and convenience. Initially, it saves space, proving particular gain in confined living conditions or portable scenarios. Subsequently, it saves time, obviating the need for constant plugging and unplugging of diversified devices from individual sockets.

Additionally, a multi outlet allows powering multiple devices concurrently. This is advantageous for charging multiple devices with quick charge functionality or sustaining the operation of a variety of appliances or gadgets simultaneously. Lastly, some multi outlets supply further benefits through features like surge protection or an integrated USB port, augmenting device safety and convenience during charging.
