These chews are a great alternative to the traditional rawhide chews or bully sticks, with 14% more protein and 89% less fat.

### [PeaksNpaws XL Long-Lasting Dog Chew Value Pack (3 Chews)](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Long+Lasting+Dog+Chews?utm\_term=peaksnpaws-xl-long-lasting-dog-chew-value-pack-3-chews)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Long+Lasting+Dog+Chews?utm_term=peaksnpaws-xl-long-lasting-dog-chew-value-pack-3-chews"><img alt="peaksnpaws-yak-milk-dog-chew-xl-value-pack-3-chews-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/peaksnpaws-yak-milk-dog-chew-xl-value-pack-3-chews-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Peaks N Paws Yak Milk Dog Chews and I must say, they're a game-changer for my pup. These chews come in XL value packs and they're made from 100% all-natural ingredients – yak milk, cow milk, lime juice, and salt – no chemicals or preservatives in sight! The product is handmade in the beautiful Himalayan mountains by skilled craftsmen who know their stuff. Each chew is designed to be long-lasting, allowing dogs to chew for hours without getting bored. 

The chews have a mild, yet delicious taste that dogs absolutely love. My pup couldn't get enough of them – he'd sit there, happily gnawing away for hours on end. The best part is that they're virtually lactose free, making them an excellent choice for dogs with sensitive tummies. They're also easily digestible, which is a huge plus. 

When it comes to chew wear, these are the real deal. My doggo tends to have pretty powerful chompers, but the chews still lasted for quite a while before she needed a new one. The fact that they're handmade also makes every chew unique – they come in different shapes and sizes, adding an element of surprise and fun for your dog. 

The packaging is absolutely adorable! The burlap sack with the cute bead stopper adds a personal touch, and it makes these chews feel extra special. I love knowing that they're created with care and craftsmanship. 

However, I will say that one of the downsides to these chews is that they come unsealed. This can sometimes lead to dried-out chews, which aren't as enjoyable for your pup. It also makes storage a bit of a challenge. If the company could come up with a more secure packaging method, that would be a solid improvement. 

Overall, the Peaks N Paws Yak Milk Dog Chews are a fantastic choice for any dog lover. They're made with all-natural ingredients, are long-lasting, and dogs absolutely adore them. The unique shapes and packaging make each chew feel like a little adventur! So, if you're looking for a fun, healthy, and all-natural treat for your furry friend, give these a try – just make sure they stay fresh!

What I also appreciate is their commitment to using simple, natural ingredients. The fact that these chews are made from a handful of ingredients sourced from the Himalayas is fantastic. I feel great about giving Max a treat that's not only delicious but also good for him. I've noticed a difference in his energy and overall well-being since he started enjoying these chews. 

However, one downside I've encountered is the inconsistent sizing of the chews I've received. Each time I've ordered, there's been some variation in the size of the chews. While this hasn't impacted Max's enjoyment, I can see how it might be frustrating for someone looking for a specific size. 

In summary, Native Pet yak chews have become a staple in my household. The chews are not only long-lasting and perfect for oral health, but also made from simple, natural ingredients. I highly recommend giving these a try if you're looking for an alternative to traditional chew options. Just be mindful of the size variations when placing your order.
