I recently had the chance to try out the Girls Champion Mesh Shorts in medium, blue size. With a lightweight mesh-polyester blend, they are perfect for game day or any sporty activity. The standard fit and 3.25-inch rise provide comfort without being too loose or too tight. 

The reflective C logo on the hem adds a touch of style and pride. And the best part? 

The heat-sealed tag makes them feel so soft, she'll forget it's even there. However, being machine-washable means they'll need some extra care to avoid fading or shrinking. Overall, these shorts are a great addition to any young athlete's wardrobe. 


### [Dri-FIT Girls Basketball Shorts](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Girls+Basketball+Shorts?utm\_term=dri-fit-girls-basketball-shorts)

Last month, I bought the Real Essentials 5-pack Youth Dry-Fit Active Athletic Basketball Gym Shorts for my son to keep him comfortable during his energetic outdoor activities. My son was thrilled to have these shorts in his wardrobe, and he loves the pockets that let him store his essentials while playing. 

One of the best features of these shorts, in my opinion, is the UPF 50+ protection. The materials used in these shorts are lightweight and fast-drying, which keeps him cool and dry during our outdoor adventures. He can stay outside for longer periods without worrying about his skin being exposed to harmful sun rays. 

However, the sizing issue has been somewhat frustrating. After receiving two incorrect sizes, my experience with returning and exchanging the shorts has been less than ideal. It would be best for the company to provide a more accurate size chart and improve their communication with customers during return processes. 

Overall, the Real Essentials 5-pack Youth Dry-Fit Active Athletic Basketball Gym Shorts are a great value for their price, and they provide the perfect balance of comfort and functionality for kids participating in various activities. There's just a bit of work required to ensure the correct sizing.

## Buyer's Guide

When it comes to girls basketball shorts, there are several important factors to consider. In this buyer's guide, we will discuss the key features to look for, the advantages of each type, and general advice to help you make the best purchase for your child's basketball needs. 


### Key Features to Look For

1. Comfort: The shorts should be lightweight and made of moisture-wicking material to keep your child cool and dry during intense basketball games. Choose shorts with a comfortable fit, avoiding tight elastic waistbands or restrictive fabrics. A seamless construction will also prevent irritation and ensure a smoother playing experience.

### Advantages of Different Types of Basketball Shorts

1. Cotton Shorts: Cotton shorts are a popular option due to their affordability and breathability. They are comfortable and easy to wash, making them a great choice for casual games or practice sessions. However, cotton is heavier and takes longer to dry, which may be a disadvantage during intense activities. 


### Material and Design Considerations

1. Moisture-wicking Fabrics: Choose basketball shorts made from materials that quickly draw sweat away from the skin, such as polyester or nylon, to ensure your child stays comfortable and focused on the game. Mesh panels can also help improve ventilation and airflow, which is especially important during hot weather.

### Additional Tips for Choosing the Best Girls Basketball Shorts

1. Fit: Basketball shorts should offer a good balance between comfort and performance. They should not be too loose, as this may limit the athlete's freedom of movement, or too tight, which could cause discomfort or even restrict blood flow. Take your child's measurements to ensure they get the right fit.

### What are the key features of girls' basketball shorts?

Girls' basketball shorts are designed to provide comfort and flexibility during sports games. They typically have moisture-wicking materials to keep the wearer cool and dry, and they come in a range of lengths to suit individual preferences. Some basketball shorts also feature reinforced seams for added durability and built-in compression to improve performance. 

Additionally, many basketball shorts have a drawstring or elastic waistband for a snug fit, and they often come in a variety of colors and patterns to match team uniforms or personal style preferences. Comfort and performance are the top priorities in the design of girls' basketball shorts, ensuring athletes can focus on their game. 


### What length options are available for girls' basketball shorts?

Girls' basketball shorts come in various lengths, including 7”, 9”, and 12” in-seam lengths. The 7” shorts are the shortest option, providing less coverage and more freedom of movement. On the other hand, the 12” shorts offer more coverage and may be better suited for younger athletes or those with specific preferences. 

Considering the intended use and the individual's comfort, athletes typically choose the length that best suits their needs. Girls' basketball shorts are designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing players to select their preferred length without compromising performance or style.

### Can girls' basketball shorts be machine-washed?

Yes, most girls' basketball shorts are machine-washable, providing a convenient and time-saving option. It is essential to follow the manufacturer's washing instructions, usually found on the care label, to ensure the best results and prolong the life of the shorts. Additionally, it is recommended to wash basketball shorts with other items to prevent any potential staining or damage. 

When washing, it is also essential to avoid using fabric softener, as it can reduce the shorts' ability to wick sweat and moisture. Instead, opt for a mild detergent specifically designed for athletic wear to maintain the shorts' performance properties. Proper care and washing techniques will keep girls' basketball shorts looking great and performing at their best for a long time. 


### Are girls' basketball shorts suitable for other sports or activities?

Girls' basketball shorts are specifically designed for the sport of basketball and may not be ideal for all other sports or activities. However, their versatility and comfort make them suitable for many situations. They can be used for warm-up or practice sessions, as well as for other recreational activities such as jogging, cycling, or casual wear. 

In some cases, it may be necessary to wear additional protective gear during other sports or activities. For example, if playing another contact sport like soccer or volleyball, wearing a protective cup or other appropriate gear would be necessary to protect the body from potential injuries. Regardless, girls' basketball shorts can serve as a comfortable and stylish choice for a variety of athletic pursuits.

### What are some popular brands of girls' basketball shorts?

There are several popular brands of girls' basketball shorts available in the market, including Nike, Under Armour, Adidas, and Champion. These brands are known for offering high-quality products with advanced features and technology designed to enhance performance and provide comfort during sports games. Some of these brands also offer a wide range of sizes, colors, and patterns to suit different preferences. 

While these brands are popular and widely recognized, it is essential to consider individual needs, preferences, and budget when selecting the right brand for your girls' basketball shorts. Researching different brands and reading reviews from other customers can help you make an informed decision and find the perfect shorts for your needs. 


### What is the difference between cotton and performance-based basketball shorts?

The primary difference between cotton and performance-based girls' basketball shorts lies in their construction and materials. Cotton basketball shorts are made from natural fibers and provide breathability, comfort, and a relaxed fit. However, cotton's absorbency can make it less suitable for high-intensity workouts or in humid conditions, as it may take longer to dry and can become heavy. 

Performance-based basketball shorts, on the other hand, are designed to provide optimal comfort and functionality during sports games. They are made from synthetic materials, such as polyester and nylon, which offer moisture-wicking properties, quick-drying capabilities, and resistance to shrinkage. These features help to minimize sweat and odors, keeping the wearer cool and dry while maximizing performance on the court. Ultimately, the choice between cotton and performance-based basketball shorts depends on personal priorities, such as comfort, sustainability, and budget considerations.
