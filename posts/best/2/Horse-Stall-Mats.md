### [Nonporous Utility Mat for Animal Environments - ISO 9001 Certified](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Horse+Stall+Mats?utm\_term=nonporous-utility-mat-for-animal-environments-iso-9001-certified)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Horse+Stall+Mats?utm_term=nonporous-utility-mat-for-animal-environments-iso-9001-certified"><img alt="ready-america-rm4872-72-pre-cut-rubber-utility-mat-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/ready-america-rm4872-72-pre-cut-rubber-utility-mat-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who's been using this rubber utility mat for a while now, I can confidently say that it's quite impressive. Its nonporous surface has proven to be a game changer, especially when it comes to maintaining hygiene in animal environments. The bottom side, with its grooves, drains water efficiently, while the top side, with its ribbed pattern, provides excellent traction. 

One of the best things about it is how easy it is to handle and clean. You can simply lift, move, and clean it whenever needed. It's not just practical, but it's also eco-friendly as it's made from 70% recycled rubber and 30% SBR, which means it won't shrink, curl, or crumble over time. 

However, one thing that could have been better is the information availability. Despite being ISO 9001 certified, there's no mention of it anywhere on the product. Overall, though, it's a great utility mat that's easy to use and maintain.

One of the most appealing features of this product is its DIY installation process. The rolled rubber mat is simple to install with minimal setup, making it a popular choice for garages, basements, and workout spaces. However, I did find that the mat's weight, which is about 50 lbs. for a 4 ft. x 10 ft. roll, can sometimes make it a bit challenging to work with. 

Upon first use, I was impressed by the mat's resilience and cushioning properties. It effectively absorbs the shock from running, exercising, and walking, providing a more comfortable experience. Additionally, the mat's high EPDM content makes it UV/Ozone resistant, ensuring that it remains durable even in harsh indoor and outdoor environments.

Thicker mats provide better cushioning and support for horses, which is especially important for older or injured horses.
