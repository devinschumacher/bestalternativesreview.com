<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Herman+Miller+Desk?utm_term=herman-miller-nelson-swag-leg-adjustable-desk-with-walnut-sides-orange-spa-blue-and-chartreuse-dividers"><img alt="herman-miller-nelson-swag-leg-desk-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/herman-miller-nelson-swag-leg-desk-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

After using the Herman Miller Nelson Swag Leg Desk for a while, I can confidently say that this desk is a true piece of art. Its curved metal legs, inspired by George Nelson, make it a standout piece in any room, while its walnut sides and white laminate top provide a sleek, modern look. The two black pencil drawers and dividers are a practical and convenient addition, perfect for keeping your workspace organized. 

One of the key highlights of this desk is its adjustable glides and grommet for cable management, ensuring a clean and functional workspace. However, there was a slight inconvenience during assembly, as I had to remove the swag legs to screw the wood screws into the metal pieces. Unfortunately, the metal pieces didn't line up perfectly, making reassembly a bit of a challenge. I had to call Herman Miller for assistance, but was left disappointed with the lack of support. 

Despite this minor issue, I am still extremely happy with my purchase of the Herman Miller Nelson Swag Leg Desk. It's a beautiful and functional addition to my workspace, and I appreciate the attention to design and quality that Herman Miller is known for.
