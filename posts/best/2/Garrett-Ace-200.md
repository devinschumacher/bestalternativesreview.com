I've been using the Garrett Ace 300 Metal Detector for a few weeks now, and I must say it's been a fantastic addition to my hobby of treasure hunting. One of the key features that stood out to me is the new digital target ID that runs from 0 to 99, which provides a wealth of information about the targets I'm detecting. 

The new 7" x 10" PROformance submersible search coil has truly impressed me. It's larger than what I'm used to, and provides better coverage, depth, and sensitivity, especially when hunting in shallow water or on beaches. The increased iron resolution also helps to tackle the challenges of finding small targets in areas with a lot of iron-laden soil, something that I often come across. 

One downside, however, is the size adjustability for the arm strap, which can be quite a hassle to set up correctly the first time. But once it's in place, it does an excellent job at keeping the detector firmly attached while in use.

## Buyer's Guide

When it comes to metal detectors, the Garrett Ace 200 is a popular choice among hobbyists and enthusiasts. But before you dive into the world of treasure hunting, it's essential to understand the critical features and considerations that influence the performance and usability of a metal detector. This buyer's guide provides an overview of the main aspects to consider when choosing a metal detector, ensuring you make an informed decision and enjoy your new hobby. 


### Ease of Use

One of the crucial factors to consider when purchasing a metal detector is its ease of use. Ideally, the device should be intuitive and simple to operate, even for beginners. Look for models that offer easy-to-read displays, adjustable settings, and pre-set modes that simplify the learning curve. Additionally, consider the weight and ergonomic design of the metal detector to ensure comfort during long hunting sessions.

### Frequency Range

The frequency range of a metal detector determines its ability to detect specific types of metals and depth. In general, higher-frequency devices such as the Garrett Ace 200 excel in shallow to medium depth detection and offer better discrimination between valuable metals, like gold and silver, and junk metals, like foil and nails. Lower-frequency models, on the other hand, tend to be better at reaching deeper targets but may not be as precise in distinguishing valuable finds. 


### Depth and Sensitivity

Depth and sensitivity are interrelated factors that dictate the performance of a metal detector. A device with high sensitivity can detect smaller and deeper targets, while a higher maximum depth means it can reach further underground. However, it's essential to find a balance between these two factors, as high sensitivity may result in increased false signals, and excess depth may sacrifice accuracy. Consider the typical hunting conditions and target types you'll be dealing with, and choose a metal detector that offers the best balance for your needs.

### Discrimination and ID

Discrimination and ID are essential features that help separate valuable metals from junk. Discrimination allows the metal detector to filter out unwanted metals based on their conductivity, while ID provides an estimation of the target's type of metal. A good discrimination system should effectively eliminate unwanted metals, such as foil, pull tabs, and nails, while maintaining a reasonable level of sensitivity for valuable metals. Additionally, look for ID systems that can accurately identify different metals and provide a clear indication of their potential value.

### What sets the Garrett Ace 200 apart from other metal detectors in the market?

The Garrett Ace 200 is designed to cater to beginners and casual hunters. Its user-friendly interface and waterproof properties make it a great choice for those who want to detect gold, silver, coins, and relics without investing in a high-end device. Additionally, it features an adjustable ground balance and eight programmable search modes to help users customize their metal detection experience. 

In terms of performance, the Garrett Ace 200 offers a high operating frequency of 6.4 kHz, which ensures the detection of small targets and increases depth perception. The detector is also compatible with various accessories, such as pinpointers and headphones, making it versatile and expandable for users' needs. 


### What is the operating range of the Garrett Ace 200?

The operating range of the Garrett Ace 200 can vary depending on several factors, such as the type of target, soil conditions, and settings. However, the device is designed to provide greater depth perception and can achieve depths of up to 10 inches (25.4 cm) for small targets and up to 15 inches (38.1 cm) for large targets. 

It is essential to consider that the actual depth achieved can vary depending on factors like the soil's mineralization and conductivity. Additionally, increasing the sensitivity can often result in a lower depth reading due to an increased reaction time and false target signals, so it's crucial to find a balance between sensitivity and ground conditions to make the most accurate depth judgments.

### Is the Garrett Ace 200 suitable for water hunting?

Certainly! One of the advantages of the Garrett Ace 200 is its fully waterproof construction, which allows it to be used in a variety of environments, including underwater. Its waterproof coating protects the circuitry, control panel, and speakers from water damage, making it an excellent choice for water hunting activities. 

When using the Garrett Ace 200 in water, it's essential to note that the coiled cord should be disconnected from the controller for better water resistance. Additionally, ensure proper grounding of the device, as damp soil may cause the detector to give false signals. With these precautions, the Garrett Ace 200 can be an effective tool for water hunting. 


### How long does the battery last on the Garrett Ace 200?

The battery life on the Garrett Ace 200 depends on various factors, including frequency usage, sensitivity settings, and continuous operation time. Typically, the device can operate for approximately 8 to 10 hours on two AA alkaline batteries, while the inbuilt battery life is estimated at around 18 hours for continuous use. 

To maximize battery life, consider turning down the sensitivity if the detection environment is not critical. Also, ensure that the batteries are fresh and clean before use. If you need a longer battery life for extended hunting sessions, consider investing in rechargeable batteries or purchasing extra AA batteries.
