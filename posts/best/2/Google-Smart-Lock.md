### [Yale Assure Lock SL Smart Wi-Fi Touchscreen Deadbolt for Keyless Entry](https://serp.ly/amazon/Google+Smart+Lock?utm\_term=yale-assure-lock-sl-smart-wi-fi-touchscreen-deadbolt-for-keyless-entry)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Google+Smart+Lock?utm_term=yale-assure-lock-sl-smart-wi-fi-touchscreen-deadbolt-for-keyless-entry"><img alt="yale-assure-lock-sl-wi-fi-and-bluetooth-deadbolt-with-ridgefield-handleset-works-with-amazon-alexa-g-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/yale-assure-lock-sl-wi-fi-and-bluetooth-deadbolt-with-ridgefield-handleset-works-with-amazon-alexa-g-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Yale Assure Lock SL is a touchscreen smart lock deadbolt that seamlessly replaces your existing lock with a secure and convenient option. The lock comes with a matching passage handleset, featuring a lever interior, ensuring style and functionality. It offers easy access to keys, passcode entry, and even voice control through integration with popular smart assistants like Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and HomeKit. 

I must say, I've been using this lock on my front door for about a month now, and it has certainly made my life more convenient than ever. Say, for instance, you're returning home after a long day at work or running errands, it's no longer necessary to fumble with keys. This lock can automatically unlock itself if your phone is nearby, making it easier to access your home. There's also a manual keypad available if you don't have your phone on you. 

One feature that I particularly appreciate is the auto-lock feature. Sometimes, we all forget to lock the door behind us, especially when our hands are full or there are children involved. With this lock, I can rest assured that my door will always lock once I leave, minimizing the risk of a burglary. Also, if you're someone who frequently misplaces your phone, you can have peace of mind knowing that you can manually lock and unlock the front door using the keypad, ensuring your home's security. 

However, not everything is perfect. One minor concern I have is the door handle's quality. While the exterior part feels sturdy and well-made, the interior knob seems a little cheap in comparison, an aspect I'd love to see improved in future models. 

In conclusion, the Yale Assure Lock SL is a versatile and user-friendly option for anyone looking for a smart lock to enhance their home security. Its features, such as auto-unlocking and manual override make it a reliable solution, while its compatibility with popular smart assistants makes it more accessible and appealing to a wider range of users.

Installing the lock was a breeze, and it definitely added a touch of sophistication to my front door. One of the standout features for me was the ability to create up to 20 unique pin codes, ensuring only those I trusted had access to my home. 

The one-touch entry feature was a game-changer. I could simply touch the unit while my phone was nearby to unlock the door. This was particularly handy when I had my hands full or needed to rush in without dealing with keys. 

However, there was one downside to the Alfred DB2-B. It struggled to function in colder temperatures, which was quite disappointing given it was marketed as a lock designed for Canadian winters.

It was also nice to have the option to lock and unlock the door using the keypad or a key, which came in handy when I needed to quickly let someone in. 

One of the standout features of this smart lock was its polished chrome finish, which looked stunning in my bathroom. However, there were a few drawbacks to using this product. First, the motorized bolt seemed to take a bit too long to engage, which sometimes left me waiting when I needed to get in or out of the house. Second, the touchscreen could be a bit sensitive at times, which made it more difficult to enter my access code. 

Overall, my experience with the Kwikset 939 WiFi Smart Lock was a mixed bag.

Another minor issue was the lock's connection to my home Wi-Fi network. Sometimes, the lock would disconnect from my network, which prevented me from being able to lock or unlock the door remotely. However, this issue was relatively infrequent and usually resolved itself within a day or two.

Overall, the Schlage Encode is a smart lock with promising features, but there are a few areas where improvements could be made, such as battery life and alarm technology.

Despite these minor hiccups, the Nest x Yale smart lock seemed sturdy and well-built, with a design that was not only attractive but also compatible with a range of door sizes.

Overall, the Nest x Yale smart lock is a convenient and attractive alternative to traditional locks. While there are a few areas that could use some improvement, such as battery life and compatibility with certain Wi-Fi networks, the pros definitely outweigh the cons.

### What is Google Smart Lock and how does it work?

Google Smart Lock is a security feature designed by Google to provide enhanced security for your Android device. It works by combining your device's built-in security locks (like passwords, PINs, and patterns) with your Google Account. The aim is to allow you to access your device without entering your security detail every time, as long as you remain close to your device or your trusted devices. 

Furthermore, Smart Lock can also recognize and remember that you typically use your device at home, at work, or in certain locations, and it can unlock the device when it's in those trusted environments. This feature can be particularly useful when you're in a hurry or your hands are full. To use Smart Lock, go to Settings, Security, and then Smart Lock. 


### How does Google Smart Lock know my trusted locations?

Google Smart Lock requires the "Detect nearby devices" and "Detect this device at the same location as" settings to be turned on. These settings allow the Smart Lock feature to know when your device is in a particular location and can consider it a trusted location. By understanding the areas where you typically use your device, Smart Lock can adjust itself to provide you with the best security and convenience possible. However, users always have the control to manage the trusted places or devices manually in the settings. 

Google Smart Lock uses a combination of GPS coordinates, Wi-Fi networks, and Bluetooth beacons to determine the locations. For example, if you leave your device at a coffee shop every day, Smart Lock learns that location as a trusted place and remembers to unlock your device next time you're close to the shop.

### Can I disable Smart Lock if I don't find it useful?

Yes, you can disable Google Smart Lock if you feel it's not adding any value to your device's security. To disable it, go to Settings, Security, and then Smart Lock. From there, you can toggle off the feature. Remember, you're also able to control which devices or places are considered 'trusted' by tapping on the trusted places or devices listed under the Smart Lock section. This allows you to have fine-grained control over the feature. 

However, disabling Smart Lock means that your device will always require a password, PIN, or pattern for unlocking. This might make accessing your device less convenient, but it will provide an extra layer of security. If you believe in the security provided by Smart Lock, you should consider leaving it enabled. 


### Is Google Smart Lock compatible with devices other than Android?

Google Smart Lock is an exclusive feature for Android devices. It does not have direct compatibility for other platforms like iOS or Windows. However, there are similar features available on these platforms, like Apple's Auto Unlock, which relies on geographic location and the user's Apple ID. For users of devices other than Android, such features might provide a similar level of convenience and security. 

Even though Smart Lock is not directly compatible with other platforms, Google does allow app developers to build applications that integrate with the Smart Lock service. This could potentially mean that in the future, some iOS or Windows apps may be able to unlock devices using Google Smart Lock with the right implementation.

### How does Google Smart Lock keep my data safe?

Google Smart Lock is designed to maintain the privacy and security of your personal data. When your device is in a trusted location, it only uses your device's sensors (like GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth) to verify the location. It does not rely on any Google services, and therefore, does not transmit any location data to Google. 

As for your Google Account linked to the device, it is kept secure through a complex authentication process. Google uses a number of security measures, such as two-factor authentication, 256-bit SSL encryption, and security checks on the server side, to protect your Google Account. This ensures that even if someone were to try and access your Google Account, it would be difficult for them to do so without the proper verification. 


### Can I use Google Smart Lock on multiple devices with the same Google Account?

Yes, you can use Google Smart Lock on multiple devices with the same Google Account, as long as the devices are Android devices. When you set up Smart Lock on a new device, it automatically adds the device to your list of trusted places. You don't need to manually add each device one by one. Also, as long as you're logged into your Google account on the device, it can be unlocked if it's in a trusted location or if it recognizes you as a trusted person. 

However, if you share your Google account with multiple people, they will also be able to unlock the device if they're in a trusted location. For this reason, it's always recommended to maintain privacy and security by using your own Google account on each device. If you prefer not to share your device's unlock status with others, you can manually remove a device's location from the Smart Lock settings.
