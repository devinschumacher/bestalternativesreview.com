In this guide, we'll discuss the important features, considerations, and general advice to help you make an informed decision when choosing a Maglite Flashlight. 


### Brightness

Brightness is one of the most crucial factors to consider when purchasing a Maglite Flashlight. Maglite offers several options, ranging from 1 to 2500 lumens.

### Water Resistance

Water resistance is another essential feature to consider. Maglite Flashlights have different water resistance ratings, ranging from IPX4 to IPX8. The higher the rating, the more water-resistant the flashlight.
