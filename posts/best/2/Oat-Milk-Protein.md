### [Garden of Life Creamy Organic Oat Milk Protein Powder - Chocolate Brownie](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Oat+Milk+Protein?utm\_term=garden-of-life-creamy-organic-oat-milk-protein-powder-chocolate-brownie)

As someone who loves a good protein shake but can't handle dairy, Garden of Life Organic Creamy Protein with Oatmilk Powder (in Chocolate Brownie flavor) has been a game changer. Not only do I appreciate that it's non-GMO, gluten-free, and kosher, but the 20 grams of plant-based protein per serving is exactly what I need to fuel my body and stay active. 

What stood out to me the most was the indulgent flavor of rich chocolate brownie, which I couldn't get enough of. The combination of stevia-sweetened chocolate and creamy oat and coconut milks created a satisfying and delicious shake. And, the addition of MCTs and [coconut water](https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativesreview.com/blob/main/posts/best/1/Coconut-Water.md) made it even more appealing to me. 

One of the features that I appreciated is the pre- and probiotic blend, which aids digestion and supports a healthy microbiome. This is something I've come to expect from high-quality protein powders. 

The only downside was that the shake was quite sweet for my taste preference, but that's just a matter of personal preference. Overall, I highly recommend Garden of Life Organic Creamy Protein with Oatmilk Powder (in Chocolate Brownie flavor) for anyone looking for a tasty, plant-based protein powder that's also dairy-free. It's definitely worth giving a try!

### [Califia Farms Oat Barista Blend Oat Milk - High Protein & Refreshing](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Oat+Milk+Protein?utm\_term=califia-farms-oat-barista-blend-oat-milk-high-protein-refreshing)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Oat+Milk+Protein?utm_term=califia-farms-oat-barista-blend-oat-milk-high-protein-refreshing"><img alt="califia-farms-refrigerated-oat-barista-blend-oat-milk-32-fl-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/califia-farms-refrigerated-oat-barista-blend-oat-milk-32-fl-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Recently, I had the opportunity to sample Califia Farms' Oat Barista Blend Oat Milk and I must say, it was a delightful experience. The first attribute that caught my attention was the natural creaminess and delicate sweetness of the milk. It was an ideal match for making creamy lattes, similar to traditional dairy milk. 

What made it even better was its structure and stretch, making it easy to steam and froth. This was particularly important for my morning latte routine. The milk produced a smooth and velvety foam that rivaled that of any dairy milk, and it effortlessly helped me create stunning latte art. 

In terms of taste, the milk had a pleasantly mild flavor that didn't overpower the aroma of my coffee or tea. It was a refreshing change from the strong artificial taste commonly found in other plant-based milks. 

However, there was one drawback to my experience. The Oat Barista Blend Oat Milk I tried failed to produce micro foam like the previous batches I had used, resulting in a watery texture that made my drinks lose their frothy essence. 

Despite this issue, I would wholeheartedly recommend Califia Farms' Oat Barista Blend Oat Milk for its natural creaminess, smooth texture, and pleasant taste. Although it didn't create micro foam in this particular batch, its other qualities more than compensate for it. Just make sure to give it a good shake before using for optimal results.

As an avid vegan, I appreciate that it's free of harsh additives and made only with responsibly sourced, organic ingredients. 

I especially found the frothing properties of this oat milk to be remarkable - it made my coffee extra smooth and velvety, truly elevating my morning brew. The consistency is spot on, and it blends perfectly with just about anything, be it hot beverages or baked goods. 

However, a drawback that I've noticed is that once opened, I have to consume it within a week, or else it starts to go off. I would like to see a longer shelf life on this one, but that might just be wishful thinking. It's a minor setback that I'm will to overlook for its overall quality. 

One more minor problem is that the packaging is susceptible to punctures and leakage during transit. I've had a couple of those, soaking up my carton and the contents. It's a bit of a bummer, yet not a deal breaker. 

Despite those few drawbacks, I believe the Pacific Foods Original Organic Oat Milk holds its own against other plant-based milk options. Its taste and texture really stand out, and it's great to know it's made with top-notch, organic ingredients. Overall, an excellent product that has found its place in my daily routine.

Many oat milk protein products offer additional nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and fiber.

Using oat milk protein as a meal replacement should be part of a well-rounded eating plan and not relied upon exclusively.
