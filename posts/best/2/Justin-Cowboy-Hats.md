### [Justin Denton Grey Wool Cowboy Hat](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Justin+Cowboy+Hats?utm\_term=justin-denton-grey-wool-cowboy-hat)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Justin+Cowboy+Hats?utm_term=justin-denton-grey-wool-cowboy-hat"><img alt="justin-3x-denton-grey-wool-cowboy-hat-7-1-9" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/justin-3x-denton-grey-wool-cowboy-hat-7-1-9/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Justin Men's 10x Straw Western Cowboy Hat](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Justin+Cowboy+Hats?utm\_term=justin-mens-10x-straw-western-cowboy-hat)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Justin+Cowboy+Hats?utm_term=justin-mens-10x-straw-western-cowboy-hat"><img alt="justin-mens-10x-ranch-hand-straw-western-hat-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/justin-mens-10x-ranch-hand-straw-western-hat-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the 10x Ranch Hand Straw Western Hat from Justin Men's collection. This cowboy hat is an affordable alternative for those who love the style but don't want to invest in a high-end one. The hat is made of quality 10x straw, which is durable and soft on the skin, perfect for long days outdoors. 

I love the cool vented eyelets on the hat crown that keeps my head cool and refreshed in the sun. The ribbon hat band with the Justin signature hat tack adds a nice touch of personality and style. However, the cowboy hat crown height and brim width may vary slightly, so it's always a good idea to measure your head and try the hat on before purchasing. 

One drawback I encountered was a slight discrepancy in the sizing. I wear a size 7.25, and the hat was a bit loose. My son, who wears a size 7.5, also found it to be loose. The next smaller size would have been a better fit for both of us. 

Despite the minor sizing issue, the 10x Ranch Hand Straw Western Hat is an affordable and stylish option for those looking for a classic straw cowboy hat.

I recently purchased the Justin Moore Back Roads 6X Premium Wool Chocolate Cowboy Hat 0625CH, and it has exceeded my expectations. The premium wool blend is both comfortable and stylish, perfect for any casual event or gathering. 

As a Bullhide creation, it oozes quality and attention to detail throughout its construction. However, its brim size is only 4 1/4 inches, which might be a bit too small for those who prefer a wider, more sun-covering hat. Nonetheless, my experience with this hat has been overwhelmingly positive, and I've received numerous compliments on its classic design and luxurious wool blend. 


### [Justin Wool Cowboy Hat for Adults](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Justin+Cowboy+Hats?utm\_term=justin-wool-cowboy-hat-for-adults)

Since acquiring this Justin 3X Americana Black Wool Cowboy Hat, it has become the embodiment of practicality and style. The pull-on closure ensures a convenient and hassle-free experience. Additionally, the cattleman crease crown adds a sense of sophistication and flair to the design.

### [Justin Bent Rail Phoenix Straw Cowboy Hat - Genuine Straw, Cattleman Crest, Vented Crown](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Justin+Cowboy+Hats?utm\_term=justin-bent-rail-phoenix-straw-cowboy-hat-genuine-straw-cattleman-crest-vented-crown)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Justin+Cowboy+Hats?utm_term=justin-bent-rail-phoenix-straw-cowboy-hat-genuine-straw-cattleman-crest-vented-crown"><img alt="justin-bent-rail-fenix-black-straw-cowboy-hat-js5256fnx-bk-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/justin-bent-rail-fenix-black-straw-cowboy-hat-js5256fnx-bk-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Justin Men's Fawn Townes Western Hat](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Justin+Cowboy+Hats?utm\_term=justin-mens-fawn-townes-western-hat)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Justin+Cowboy+Hats?utm_term=justin-mens-fawn-townes-western-hat"><img alt="justin-mens-6x-fawn-townes-western-felt-hat-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/justin-mens-6x-fawn-townes-western-felt-hat-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer, I tried out the Justin Men's 6X Fawn Townes Western Felt Hat and was disappointed with my experience. The highlight of this hat was the leather band featuring studded details and a fringe tie-up, which did add a nice touch to the overall design. However, the 4 1/2" brim felt a bit too big for my liking, and the elastic sweatband left marks on my forehead. 

Unfortunately, the hat I received was not the one I initially ordered. I expected a 6X Fawn-colored felt hat, but instead received a 4X Taupe (brown) hat. To make matters worse, I found a loss-prevention device bolted to the inside of the hat band, preventing me from trying it on. This not-so-glamorous experience led me to doubt my decision to ever buy a hat online again.

As a fan of cowboy hats, I was excited to try on the Justin Black Lonestar 2x Wool Cowboy Hat. I loved that it's crafted with 100% premium wool which made it both comfortable to wear and stylish. The cattleman crease crown definitely added a classic touch to this hat. 

The synthetic leather sweatband was a nice added feature which kept my head dry. However, I would have preferred if it was made in the US instead of Mexico. 

Overall, this cowboy hat was a great addition to my wardrobe, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to up their cowboy hat game.

However, there were a few drawbacks to this cowboy hat. Firstly, I noticed a small issue with the hatband, as it appeared a bit uneven and had some hot glue residue that I had to remove before wearing it. Secondly, I found that the hat was slightly smaller than expected, so I had to stretch it a bit to get the perfect fit.

I've been sporting the Justin 6X Natural Kermit Western hat for a while now and it's become my go-to when I'm hitting the town.
