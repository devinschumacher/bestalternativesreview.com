Recently, I decided to add some color to my office by getting an orchid as a houseplant. I picked this Watercolor Blue Orchid from Just Add Ice, and I must say, it's been an excellent addition. The first thing that stood out was the 5-inch white ceramic pottery it comes in, which adds a touch of elegance. The orchid itself is lovely and has been blooming beautifully for weeks now. I've been taking care of it by watering it once a week with ice cubes or a quarter cup of water, as instructed, and keeping it in bright but indirect light. 

However, there were a few hiccups in the delivery process as two of my colleagues received their orchids in different states than expected. Despite these minor inconveniences, the overall experience has been positive. My orchid is thriving, and I'm excited to see how it grows in the coming months. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a beautiful and low-maintenance houseplant.

The plant arrived in perfect condition and immediately caught my attention with its stunning, red blooms. Not only did it add a touch of elegance to my living space, but the care instructions provided in the package were surprisingly helpful - I learned that my new plant loved bright, indirect sunlight, and needed moist, yet not overly wet, soil. 

One aspect I didn't expect was the need for a stake or wooden dowel to help the plant stand vertically due to its weight. Nevertheless, the provided nursery pot seemed well-draining, making it easier for me to maintain the ideal conditions for my new, festive addition to my home. 

I was also happy to notice that the Red Painted Anthurium did not lose any leaves during its transition from the nursery to my home, and after following the recommended care, it has continued to thrive, with its vibrant blooms attracting countless compliments from my visitors. 

There were some slight concerns regarding the potential issue with pet-friendliness, but I'm relieved this was mentioned in the plant care instructions.

Recently, I had the pleasure of incorporating the Othonna capensis Ruby Necklace into my diverse collection of indoor succulents. This extraordinary plant boasts a trail of multicolored stems, ranging from deep red to hues of purple and green. It's the delicate, narrow leaves that truly stand out, showcasing their resemblance to precious gem pendants, hence the name "Ruby Necklace."

What sets this succulent apart from others is its continuous production of vibrant yellow, daisy-like flowers on a striking, reddish-hued stalk throughout the year. These flowers further add to the plant's allure and charm. With its origins from a reputable California-licensed greenhouse nursery, customers can have peace of mind knowing they are receiving a high-quality, healthy plant.

A key element to consider when handling succulents is their delicate leaves, which can potentially fall off during transportation. However, these leaves have a knack for growing back swiftly if damaged. To ensure optimal growth, I followed the seller's recommendation of placing the Ruby Necklace in a partially shaded area. So far, the plant appears to be thriving in this environment.

The addition of the Ruby Necklace succulent has undoubtedly enhanced the aesthetic appeal of my indoor plant collection, and I am eager to witness the stunning color transformation as the plant continues to grow and develop.
