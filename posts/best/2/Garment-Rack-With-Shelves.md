The bars on the side serve as a handy spot to hang towels or trousers, while the layers are convenient for storing shoes, slippers, or even storage bags. The top of the rack is perfect for holding travel bags or household items that aren't used frequently. 

However, there were a couple of drawbacks I encountered. First, the color of the bamboo was darker than I expected when I ordered it, so I had to adjust my expectations in that regard. Additionally, I found that regular full-length hangers won't fit on some of the bars like they should, which means I had to hang them at an angle and only use a few items at a time. 

Overall, the MoNiBloom Bamboo 6-Tier Garment Rack has been a useful addition to my closet, and if you're looking to tidy up your space, it's worth considering, despite those minor issues.
