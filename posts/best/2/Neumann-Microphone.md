When investing in a microphone, you want to ensure that it will withstand the rigors of regular use. Neumann microphones are built to professional standards, but it's crucial to maintain them properly to prevent damage and ensure optimal performance. Regular cleaning, handling care, and storage can significantly preserve the life of your microphone and maintain its sound quality.
