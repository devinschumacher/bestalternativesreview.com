However, I wished it came with a groundsheet, so it would be less annoying to constantly purchase one separately. The side doors made entry easy, but the absence of a zip-up door felt inconvenient on a windy night.

The ultralight design made carrying it a breeze. Weighing just 5lb, it was incredibly portable and the 7'3" standing room provided plenty of space for us to move around comfortably. The stove jack was a lifesaver, we could cook indoor and enjoy the warmth of the stove, plus the storage bag came in handy for organizing our gear. 

However, it had a few downsides that I noticed, the first was that it only had two windows, which was not a deal-breaker for us, but could be an issue if you prefer more natural lighting. Also, the tent did not come with its own poles, so we had to figure it out on our own. Still, overall, this teepee tent exceeded my expectations and stood up to the rigorous demands of a camping trip.

What stood out in my experience was the ease of setting it up. It boasts a 'pole-free' design, and with a bit of assistance, it's a breeze to get it upright. The guy-lines are also easy to adjust, even on my own. 

However, when it comes to packing, the 19lbs weight has proved to be a bit of a challenge. But, on the plus side, it's a testimony to the sturdy build of this hot tent. 

This tent has proven to be a game-changer during my camping trips. It has a spacious interior that can accommodate 3-4 people with the stove and up to 6 without.

It's also worth mentioning that the tent's construction makes it resistant to wear and tear, mold, mildew, and fire, adding to its overall durability. 

I've nothing but praise for the customer service at Esker Tents and Canadian Outdoor Equipment too. They've been responsive and professional, delivering on their promise of top-notch products.

### [OneFires Spacious Family Teepee Tent with Stove Jack](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Hot+Tent?utm\_term=onefires-spacious-family-teepee-tent-with-stove-jack)

OneFire's Hot Tent felt like a game changer on my recent camping trip. Not only was it spacious enough for me and my buddies, it also offered the option to go half inner tent, making it great for smaller groups. The outer tent featured sturdy aluminum poles and was coated in PU3000mm waterproof material, keeping us nice and dry in the rain. 

However, while the half inner tent option was awesome, it also added a bit of extra weight to lug around. At 4.1lb, it wasn't lightweight, and I could feel it after a long hike. Plus, the teepee shape and large diameter meant we had to be extra careful setting it up to avoid any unwanted collapse or discomfort. 

Overall, this hot tent proved to be a great, family-friendly option for camping in the fall or winter. While there were a few inconveniences, the warm, cozy sensation it provided made all the extra effort worth it.

### How Long Does the Hot Tent's Heating System Last?

The Hot Tent's heating system typically lasts for approximately 4-6 hours on high heat settings, depending on the environment and the specific model.
