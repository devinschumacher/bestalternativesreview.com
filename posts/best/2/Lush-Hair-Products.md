Last week, I finally gave Lush's Squeak shampoo a try after hearing all the buzz around it. First impressions? The scent is out of this world â€“ a blend of citrus, seaweed, and sea salt that'll transport you to a tropical paradise. 

Using the shampoo was a game-changer. After just one wash, my hair felt noticeably cleaner and softer. It also added a surprising amount of volume, which made my hair look fresh and bouncy. Even though I have oily hair, Squeak didn't weigh it down or make it appear greasy. 

The best part? The shampoo left my hair incredibly moisturized and well-conditioned without feeling weighed down or heavy. I could even skip a day of washing and still look presentable, which is a huge win for me. 

Overall, I'm extremely happy with my decision to try Squeak shampoo. It has quickly become a staple in my hair care routine, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new shampoo that combines the best of scent, conditioning, and volumizing power. This is definitely one product I'll be repurchasing in the future!

### [Tofu-Infused SLS-Free Vegan Shampoo for Strong Hair](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lush+Hair+Products?utm\_term=tofu-infused-sls-free-vegan-shampoo-for-strong-hair)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lush+Hair+Products?utm_term=tofu-infused-sls-free-vegan-shampoo-for-strong-hair"><img alt="lush-tofu-cream-shampoo-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lush-tofu-cream-shampoo-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Not only does it smell amazing, but its silken tofu-based formula has been making my hair stronger and smoother. As someone who uses hair products quite frequently, I appreciate that it's SLS-free and vegan. 

One thing that stands out is how nourishing this shampoo is, especially for those with damaged or processed hair. It leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable, and I've noticed less breakage since I started using it. However, one downside is that it can leave your shower or sink a bit slippery, so make sure to rinse thoroughly. Overall, if you're looking for a protein-rich, nourishing shampoo, Lush's Tofu Cream Shampoo is definitely worth giving a try!

### [Discover the Lush H'Suan Wen Hua Hair Treatment](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lush+Hair+Products?utm\_term=discover-the-lush-hsuan-wen-hua-hair-treatment)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lush+Hair+Products?utm_term=discover-the-lush-hsuan-wen-hua-hair-treatment"><img alt="lush-hsuan-wen-hua-hair-treatment-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lush-hsuan-wen-hua-hair-treatment-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Treat your locks to a nourishing pamper session with Lush's H'Suan WEN Hua hair treatment. Made from a luxurious blend of components, this product promises to provide dry or damaged hair with a hydrating boost. Fresh bananas work their magic to soften strands, while balsamic vinegar adds a luster-enhancing shine. Rosemary, in turn, is featured for its toning and revitalizing effects on hair. 

The reviews are a mixed bag, with some raving about the product's ability to restore hair health and others expressing disappointment due to its adverse effects on their hair. Some customers particularly appreciate the hair treatment's effectiveness on fine or thin hair, stating that it significantly reduces breakage and greasiness. Meanwhile, others with thicker hair types have also reported noticeable improvements in their hair's texture and appearance. 

Although some find the scent a bit intense, the overall consensus leans towards the positive, highlighting the treatment's ability to leave hair silky, smooth, and full of life. However, it's important to remember that everyone's hair type and texture are different; it may be beneficial to test the product on a small section before fully committing to its usage in order to gauge its effects on individual hair types. 


### [Big Sea Salt Shampoo by Lush](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lush+Hair+Products?utm\_term=big-sea-salt-shampoo-by-lush)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lush+Hair+Products?utm_term=big-sea-salt-shampoo-by-lush"><img alt="lush-big-sea-salt-shampoo-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lush-big-sea-salt-shampoo-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Big Sea Salt Shampoo by Lush is a popular choice for those seeking natural hair products. The shampoo is loved by many for its volumizing properties and ability to add softness, shine, and volume to hair. However, it's not recommended for those with color-treated or damaged hair, as it can strip the color away. The salt crystals in the shampoo help scrub through the scalp, giving it a thorough cleanse. The shampoo has a refreshing, beachy scent and a luxurious lather. Big Sea Salt is also known for its long-lasting clean effect, meaning you can go multiple days between washes without your hair feeling greasy. 

[One of the main advantages of this shampoo is that it's perfect for all hair types, including fine and thick hair, and works well for straight and curly hair.](https://gist.github.com/janeknowsbest77/179b5b60c86bc2a8d8b6bf94ba640810) The salt in the shampoo not only cleanses the scalp but also gives it a gentle exfoliation, making it ideal for those with sensitive skin or scalp conditions like dandruff. It's packed in a large tub, which means it lasts for a long time, and the scent is reminiscent of a relaxing beach vacation. 

While Big Sea Salt Shampoo is loved by many, some users have encountered issues with it, such as color fading due to the salt content. However, with proper use and understanding of the product, these issues can be minimized. [It's essential to use a small amount of shampoo on the scalp only, as it doesn't require excessive lathering or large amounts of product.](https://gist.github.com/janeknowsbest77/af2d773617ab3119e723bb66cbcc6b78) This shampoo has become a staple for many users, and they report noticeable improvements in hair health and volume. 

In summary, Big Sea Salt Shampoo by Lush is a versatile and well-loved hair product that adds volume, softness, and shine to various hair types. Its unique formula and gentle exfoliation properties make it a popular choice for those seeking natural, eco-friendly hair care options. While it may not be suitable for those with color-treated or damaged hair, it's an excellent option for those looking to enhance their hair's natural beauty and texture. 


### [Lush Candy Rain Conditioner: Hydrating and Sweet-Scented](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lush+Hair+Products?utm\_term=lush-candy-rain-conditioner-hydrating-and-sweet-scented)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lush+Hair+Products?utm_term=lush-candy-rain-conditioner-hydrating-and-sweet-scented"><img alt="lush-candy-rain-conditioner-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lush-candy-rain-conditioner-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using Lush's Candy Rain conditioner daily to combat my dry, tangled hair. While I have mixed feelings about the strong sugary scent, the product has indeed made a noticeable difference in the texture and appearance of my hair. 

I particularly love how soft it leaves my curls feeling; the rich lather and gentle detangling are also bonuses. However, I've found that it can be a bit too heavy for my hair, often causing it to feel a bit weighed down. 

But overall, Candy Rain conditioner is a decent choice for anyone looking for a nourishing, moisturizing hair treatment. 


### [Lush Fairly Traded Honey Shampoo for Gorgeous Hair](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lush+Hair+Products?utm\_term=lush-fairly-traded-honey-shampoo-for-gorgeous-hair)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lush+Hair+Products?utm_term=lush-fairly-traded-honey-shampoo-for-gorgeous-hair"><img alt="lush-honey-shampoo-fairly-traded-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lush-honey-shampoo-fairly-traded-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

For a while now, I've been struggling with my hair. It got tangled easily, the shine was gone, and the ends were really dry. And that's when I discovered Lush's Honey Shampoo. Let me tell you, it's really turned things around for me! The first thing I noticed was the scent, it smells like fresh honey and it was just so pleasant. 

The texture of the shampoo was really unique. It didn't make too much lather, but that didn't bother me. What mattered more was how soft my hair turned out to be. It felt so supple, not at all like the usual post-shower feel. Plus, it made my hair glossy and shiny. I started getting compliments on how smooth my hair was! 

But it wasn't just the shine that got everyone's attention. Even my friends who have thick hair were amazed by how much less tangled their hair was after using this shampoo. The shampoo works incredibly well on all hair types. 

There's one thing that bothers me a little. The shampoo has honey in it and it can get really sticky when it's cold. That means I have to wash my hair after leaving the bathroom. Some people might also find the smell a bit overpowering, but for me, it's a small price to pay for how amazing my hair looks. 

Overall, I'd definitely recommend Lush's Honey Shampoo. It's a bit expensive, but for me, it's totally worth it for how amazing my hair looks and feels. Plus, knowing that it was made with fairly-traded honey makes me feel good about supporting brands that care about their workers. 


### [Natural Sea Spray Hair Mist by Lush](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lush+Hair+Products?utm\_term=natural-sea-spray-hair-mist-by-lush)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lush+Hair+Products?utm_term=natural-sea-spray-hair-mist-by-lush"><img alt="lush-sea-spray-hair-mist-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lush-sea-spray-hair-mist-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Lush Sea Spray Hair Mist is a game-changer for anyone seeking that effortless, beachy look. As someone with fine straight hair, I've always struggled with achieving those perfect curls and waves. However, with this sea salt spray, I've found a new companion to help me create the desired texture. 

What sets this product apart is its ability to transform my hair into a beachy, wavy kind with just a few spritzes. It's perfect for those middle-part, curtain hairstyles that are so popular on social media. The volume and shine it provides are impressive, and the scent of essential oils adds a nice touch. 

One downside is that the scent can be overpowering, which might be an issue if you're sensitive to strong fragrances. Additionally, some users have reported having a hard time getting even distribution with the product, causing it to concentrate on certain sections of the hair. 

Overall, I highly recommend Lush Sea Spray Hair Mist to anyone looking to add some life and texture to their hair. It's a reliable and easy-to-use product that leaves your hair looking and feeling amazing. 


### [Lush Rehab Salty Shampoo for Revitalized Hair](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lush+Hair+Products?utm\_term=lush-rehab-salty-shampoo-for-revitalized-hair)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lush+Hair+Products?utm_term=lush-rehab-salty-shampoo-for-revitalized-hair"><img alt="lush-rehab-salty-shampoo-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lush-rehab-salty-shampoo-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who enjoys experimenting with different hair care products, I decided to give Lush's Rehab Salty Shampoo a try. I was intrigued by the enzymic cleanse, as well as the minty-fresh scent. 

On the first use, the shampoo lathered up nicely and left my hair feeling refreshed. The scent was invigorating, and it was fun to have a hint of mint in my hair care routine. However, I did notice some downsides to this product. 

After a few weeks of use, my hair started to feel dry and frizzy. The lack of moisture made it difficult to manage, causing my hair to tangle easily. In addition, my hair felt more prone to breakage, leading to a noticeable loss of volume. 

Considering the pros and cons, I'd say this shampoo is better suited for those with shorter hair or those who prefer a more dry and matte finish. If you're looking for a product to add moisture and shine to your locks, I'd suggest exploring other options. 


### [Revitalizing Valkyrie Hair Conditioner by Lush](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lush+Hair+Products?utm\_term=revitalizing-valkyrie-hair-conditioner-by-lush)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lush+Hair+Products?utm_term=revitalizing-valkyrie-hair-conditioner-by-lush"><img alt="lush-valkyrie-conditioner-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lush-valkyrie-conditioner-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The enchanting Valkyrie conditioner by Lush Hair Products proved to be a true ally in my quest for glorious locks. With its velvety richness, this deep hair conditioner worked wonders in repairing, rebuilding, and strengthening my precious strands. 

I had been battling a common hair foe â€“ dry, brittle hair â€“ when I decided to give Valkyrie a whirl. Its luxurious lather, infused with the intoxicating scent of Turkish Delight, provided a delightful and much-needed haircare experience. To my relief and amazement, the conditioner delivered on its promise â€“ it left my hair feeling incredibly soft and noticeably more manageable. 

Aside from its rejuvenating effects on my hair, Valkyrie proved to be a versatile ally. It shone brilliantly in my daily self-care routine, as well as during special occasions. With Valkyrie, I was able to banish my frizz with grace and aplomb, and I have never looked back. 

However, my blissful Valkyrie experience was not without its challenges. There were moments when I encountered certain difficulties, like a few tangled strands after use, which required a bit more brushing. But, as fate would have it, these inconveniences were swiftly overshadowed by the triumphant rejuvenation of my locks, leaving me in awe of this extraordinary product. 

Bear in mind that while Valkyrie is a truly magical conditioner, its scent might not be to everyone's taste. But if you are a fan of the delicate yet captivating aroma of Turkish Delight, and you seek the perfect partner in your quest for divine hair, look no further than Lush's Valkyrie conditioner. 


### [Rich Conditioner for Damaged Hair by Lush](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lush+Hair+Products?utm\_term=rich-conditioner-for-damaged-hair-by-lush)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lush+Hair+Products?utm_term=rich-conditioner-for-damaged-hair-by-lush"><img alt="lush-retread-conditioner-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lush-retread-conditioner-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

After a long day, trying out Lush's Retread conditioner was a real treat for my tired hair. I couldn't help but notice the soothing scent of olive oil mixed with the rich aroma of soy milk as I massaged the product gently into my hair. This luxurious conditioner really helped tame my frizz and left my hair feeling incredibly soft and moisturized. I also appreciated the fact that it's vegan-friendly, which is a major plus for those of us who care about the environment and animal welfare. 

One thing that stood out, and pleasantly so, was the amount of product I got for a relatively affordable price. I didn't have to use too much to feel a noticeable difference in my hair. The combination of agar agar, soy milk, and olive oil really made a difference in my damaged hair. Not only did my hair feel healthier, but the softer texture was a nice bonus as well! 

However, there were a few hiccups along the way. The scent, while pleasing to me, might be a bit too overwhelming for some users. I found that I had to be careful not to use too much, as my hair could get quite greasy or heavy-feeling otherwise. 

Another unexpected issue came when I compared this product with the old Retread formula. While I liked the new vegan version, I understood a few reviewers' disappointment in the scent and performance differences from the previous formulation. Despite these slight drawbacks, I still recommend Retread for anyone looking to provide their hair with a much-needed boost of hydration and shine. 


### [Lush Power Conditioner: Nourishing Hair Treatment](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lush+Hair+Products?utm\_term=lush-power-conditioner-nourishing-hair-treatment)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lush+Hair+Products?utm_term=lush-power-conditioner-nourishing-hair-treatment"><img alt="lush-power-conditioner-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lush-power-conditioner-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Lush Power Conditioner is a true game-changer for those with curls, coils, and textured hair in need of nourishment and volume. This conditioner effortlessly combines hydration and repair, delivering a luxurious experience with a delightful scent reminiscent of Turmeric Latte. 

Though it may not be a perfect fit for all hair types, its targeted benefits make it a must-try for those seeking a lush, revitalized mane. 


### [Lush Daddy-O Shampoo for Blondes](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lush+Hair+Products?utm\_term=lush-daddy-o-shampoo-for-blondes)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lush+Hair+Products?utm_term=lush-daddy-o-shampoo-for-blondes"><img alt="lush-daddy-o-shampoo-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lush-daddy-o-shampoo-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Lush's Daddy-O hair shampoo is a popular choice for those with lighter hair colors, such as blonde, gray, or graying hair. [Aiming to keep brass at bay and maintain a fresh, healthy appearance, it's a go-to shampoo for many.](https://gist.github.com/janeknowsbest77/6c64d93992d23ee6588eaecd13722d17) 

However, some users have experienced a change in the shampoo's formula, with the new version having a slightly different scent and a runnier consistency. This change has led to complaints about the shampoo's cleaning performance and a lack of the signature violet scent. 

Additionally, some users have reported staining issues on clothes and surfaces, adding to the disappointment. Despite these issues, many customers still appreciate the shampoo's ability to tone their hair and leave it feeling bright and shiny. 


### [Lush Violet Conditioner for Blonde, Grey, and White Hair](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lush+Hair+Products?utm\_term=lush-violet-conditioner-for-blonde-grey-and-white-hair)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lush+Hair+Products?utm_term=lush-violet-conditioner-for-blonde-grey-and-white-hair"><img alt="lush-violet-cream-conditioner-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lush-violet-cream-conditioner-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Lush Violet Cream Conditioner recently and was blown away by the results. This rich purple concoction is not just an eye-catcher but a true hair-saver, too. 

After the first use, I noticed my hair was significantly softer and more manageable than before. The unique combination of shine-enhancing ingredients in this conditioner has given my hair a new lease of life, leaving it looking and feeling luscious. 

And as a bonus, my color-treated blonde strands have never looked better! But there's always a catch, isn't there? 

While this purple powerhouse has worked wonders for my hair, the bottle can be a bit tricky to handle due to its slippery surface. A minor inconvenience that I can overlook given the fantastic results on my hair. Overall, I'd highly recommend the Lush Violet Cream Conditioner to anyone after a hair transformation without breaking the bank. 


### [Renee's Lush Shea SoufflÃ© Hair & Scalp Oil: Soften, Strengthen, and Define Curls](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lush+Hair+Products?utm\_term=renees-lush-shea-soufflÃ©-hair-scalp-oil-soften-strengthen-and-define-curls)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lush+Hair+Products?utm_term=renees-lush-shea-soufflÃ©-hair-scalp-oil-soften-strengthen-and-define-curls"><img alt="lush-renees-shea-souffl--hair-scalp-oil-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lush-renees-shea-souffl--hair-scalp-oil-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried Lush's Renee's Shea SoufflÃ© Hair & Scalp Oil in my daily hair routine, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for me. As a lover of hair oils, I appreciate products that help manage my frizz, add shine, and strengthen my curls without weighing my hair down. 

One of the defining aspects of this product for me was its delightful scent. Every time I applied it, I caught a whiff of its delicious aroma, which only made me want to use more. The sweet, subtle fragrance was unlike anything I've smelled in a hair oil before, and it quickly became one of my favorite parts of my beauty routine. 

However, one downside I encountered was the oil's heaviness. While it did an excellent job nourishing my hair, it left a slightly greasy residue, which could be a problem for those with oilier hair types. Despite that, I found that the oil didn't leave my hair feeling weighed down, so it still managed to meet my expectations despite the heavy texture. 

Overall, I've had a positive experience with Lush's Renee's Shea SoufflÃ© Hair & Scalp Oil. [It's a versatile product that caters to different hair types, and I appreciate how it effectively controls frizz, strengthens my curls, and adds shine.](https://gist.github.com/janeknowsbest77/de8dc3e142148489f131aa365410df18) Its delightful, sweet fragrance and ability to hold style well are added bonuses, making it a worthy addition to my hair care routine. 


### [Lush Dirty Styling Cream for Sleek Hairstyles](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lush+Hair+Products?utm\_term=lush-dirty-styling-cream-for-sleek-hairstyles)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lush+Hair+Products?utm_term=lush-dirty-styling-cream-for-sleek-hairstyles"><img alt="lush-dirty-styling-cream-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lush-dirty-styling-cream-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Lush's Dirty [Styling Cream](https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativesreview.com/blob/main/posts/best/3/Styling-Cream.md) has been a staple in my hair routine for months now, and I can't imagine living without it. Its medium hold strength and matte finish keep my hair looking professional yet subtle, perfect for a slick back or neat parting. I appreciate its versatility, allowing me to achieve a wide range of hair styles. 

The scent of this product is pleasant, with a hint of mint and herb, but I must admit it can be a little overpowering at times. A slight tweak in the scent profile might be welcome for those with more sensitive noses. Additionally, the weight of the cream varies, and some days it can feel a little greasier than others, so it's essential to find the right balance. 

In my experience, the greasiness of Dirty Styling Cream is only accentuated when not washed out properly. I highly recommend thoroughly rinsing your hair to avoid any leftover residue. Overall, I would say that this product is worth giving a try if you want a reliable and durable hairstyling cream with a touch of freshness.

I must say, Lush's Happy Happy Joy Joy Conditioner was a game changer for my hair routine. Not only did it leave my hair feeling silky smooth, but the rose water and almond milk scent was a delightful treat for my senses. However, there was one thing I noticed â€“ it did tend to weigh down my fine hair a bit.

I recently gave Lush's Roots Scalp Treatment a try, and I must say, it has become my go-to for maintaining a healthy scalp and luscious hair. This treatment works magic for fine or thin hair, adding volume and shine while soothing any itchiness or inflammation. 

One of the highlights for me has been the refreshing scent of mint, citrus, and honey. These ingredients work together to create a tingling, invigorating sensation that leaves my hair feeling clean and revitalized. I've also noticed that my scalp appears healthier and smoother after using this treatment regularly. 

The application process is simple and straightforward. I typically scoop a small amount of the product onto my fingertips and gently massage it onto the roots of my hair before washing it out. The creamy texture makes it easy to spread and leaves my hair with a subtle, natural shine. 

While I've been consistently pleased with the Roots Scalp Treatment, I have encountered one minor drawback. On occasions, I've noticed that the product takes a bit longer than usual to fully rinse out of my hair. But overall, the pros far outweigh the cons, and I'm thrilled to have discovered this extraordinary hair and scalp companion.
