I recently tried the Bissell SpotClean Proheat Pet Portable Carpet Cleaner and I must say, it's been quite an experience. This little powerhouse made it so easy to clean up the spots and stains that had lingered on my carpets for way too long. The built-in Heat Wave Technology did a fantastic job maintaining water temperature while cleaning, resulting in spotless, stain-free carpets. The lightweight design made it a breeze to use, and I could easily store it when not in use. 

One thing that stood out was the versatility of this machine. From carpets to upholstery, stairs, and even my car, it tackled them all with ease. The three professional tools included were a game-changer, and I loved the flexibility they offered. However, I did notice a few drawbacks. The first was the noise level – it could be quite loud at times, which made it a bit challenging to use in quieter environments. Secondly, the capacity of the machine was relatively small, which meant frequent trips to the sink to refill the water tank. 

Overall, I found the Bissell SpotClean Proheat Pet Portable Carpet Cleaner to be a valuable addition to my cleaning arsenal. While there are a few cons, the pros definitely outweigh them, especially when it comes to cleaning those pesky stains. 


### [BISSELL SpotClean Proheat Portable Carpet Cleaner for Stain Removal](https://serp.ly/amazon/Hand+Held+Shampooer?utm\_term=bissell-spotclean-proheat-portable-carpet-cleaner-for-stain-removal)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Hand+Held+Shampooer?utm_term=bissell-spotclean-proheat-portable-carpet-cleaner-for-stain-removal"><img alt="bissell-spotclean-proheat-portable-spot-and-stain-carpet-cleaner-2694-blue-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bissell-spotclean-proheat-portable-spot-and-stain-carpet-cleaner-2694-blue-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Using the Bissell SpotClean ProHeat is like having a superhero in the room, ready to take on the most challenging stains and spot cleaning tasks. The built-in HeatWave Technology was certainly a game-changer, ensuring even the most stubborn stains were a thing of the past. 

One thing that stood out to me was just how versatile it was. Whether I had to tackle dirt on stairs or grime on carpets, this little machine was always up for the challenge. Its lightweight design made it a breeze to maneuver, and the fact that it's easy to store away when not in use was a nice added bonus. 

However, there were a couple of not-so-pleasant surprises. For starters, while this spot cleaner is powerful, it required a good amount of elbow grease to really get the job done. I found myself putting in a bit more effort than I would have liked to ensure the spot was thoroughly cleaned. 

Secondly, the hose and water chambers seemed to be built with a little less durability in mind. I had to use caution and take extra care to avoid any issues or damage, which felt a tad inconvenient. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, overall, I'm happy with the Bissell SpotClean ProHeat. It's a handy tool to have in the house for those unexpected messes, and its ease of use and storage made it a great addition to my cleaning arsenal.

### [Portable Carpet Cleaner: Bissell Pet Stain Cordless Eraser (3180)](https://serp.ly/amazon/Hand+Held+Shampooer?utm\_term=portable-carpet-cleaner-bissell-pet-stain-cordless-eraser-3180)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Hand+Held+Shampooer?utm_term=portable-carpet-cleaner-bissell-pet-stain-cordless-eraser-3180"><img alt="bissell-pet-stain-eraser-cordless-portable-carpet-cleaner-3181" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bissell-pet-stain-eraser-cordless-portable-carpet-cleaner-3181/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a pet owner, I've been there - dealing with those unexpected pet messes. And if you're anything like me, you know that quick, easy cleanup is the key to maintaining your sanity. That's where Bissell's Pet Stain Eraser comes in handy. This little powerhouse is the perfect tool to tackle those inevitable messes in a snap. 

The first thing that struck me was how lightweight it was - even with its built-in battery, it barely felt like I was carrying anything. With a 3.3-pound design, it's a breeze to maneuver around the house, and the 7.2V lithium-ion battery makes it easy to grab and go whenever needed. 

But what really sets this portable carpet cleaner apart is its ability to remove tough pet stains. The OXY formula included in the package, which stores right in the machine, works wonders on pesky stains, lifting them up and leaving your carpets looking as good as new. No need to worry about mixing water and cleaner here. The fact that no water is required also makes cleanup a breeze - just empty the tank when it's full. 

Of course, no product is without its cons, and the Pet Stain Eraser was no exception. The suction may not be as powerful as some full-sized carpet cleaners, but for the size of the cleaner, it gets the job done. The small tank size does mean you'll need to empty and refill it frequently, but again, for a small device, it's a manageable drawback. 

In terms of craftsmanship, the Bissell Pet Stain Eraser is a solid choice. It's easy to assemble and takes minimal effort to store away when not in use. One downside is its noise level, which can be a bit louder than expected, but given the small size of the cleaner, it's not too surprising. 

Overall, the Bissell Pet Stain Eraser is a handy tool for pet owners looking for a quick, easy-to-use solution to those inevitable pet messes. Its lightweight design, powerful stain-removing capabilities, and convenient no-water formula make it a worthwhile addition to any pet owner's arsenal, even if it isn't perfect. 


### [Ewbank Cascade Red Cordless Carpet Manual Shampooer](https://serp.ly/amazon/Hand+Held+Shampooer?utm\_term=ewbank-cascade-red-cordless-carpet-manual-shampooer)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Hand+Held+Shampooer?utm_term=ewbank-cascade-red-cordless-carpet-manual-shampooer"><img alt="ewbank-cascade-cordless-manual-carpet-shampooer-red-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ewbank-cascade-cordless-manual-carpet-shampooer-red-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently used the Ewbank Cascade Carpet Shampooer and I have to say, it works pretty well! The easy fill system with tank markers is a big plus as it allows me to keep track of the water level easily. And the telescopic handle with trigger release makes it very convenient to use. What really stood out to me was the fact that it's lightweight yet highly effective in cleaning my carpets. 

The large capacity 2.5 liter tank ensures a longer cleaning time, and the free Ewbank carpet shampoo included is a great bonus. The roller with twin brush strips works the active shampoo deep into the carpet fibers, and the shampoo is designed to lift dirt as the foam dries. This means that any residue is easily vacuumed away once the carpet is completely dry, leaving me with carpets that look and smell clean and fresh. 

However, there is one drawback - it does require a lot of effort to push it back and forth across the carpet. But overall, I'm pretty satisfied with this carpet shampooer. It may not be the best on the market, but it's definitely worth considering, especially if you're on a budget. 


### [Bissell Little Green HydroSteam Portable Carpet Cleaner 3532: Saving Pets and Cleaning Messes](https://serp.ly/amazon/Hand+Held+Shampooer?utm\_term=bissell-little-green-hydrosteam-portable-carpet-cleaner-3532-saving-pets-and-cleaning-messes)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Hand+Held+Shampooer?utm_term=bissell-little-green-hydrosteam-portable-carpet-cleaner-3532-saving-pets-and-cleaning-messes"><img alt="bissell-little-green-hydrosteam-portable-carpet-cleaner-3533" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bissell-little-green-hydrosteam-portable-carpet-cleaner-3533/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who frequently deals with messes and spills, the Bissell Little Green HydroSteam Portable Carpet Cleaner has become one of my go-to tools. Firstly, its compact size is a game-changer - it's light enough to carry around, which means there are no more backaches from lugging around heavy, cumbersome cleaners. But the real standout feature is the HydroSteam Technology. I remember the first time I tried it, and the results were nothing short of impressive. The steam not only made cleaning more efficient but also broke down stains in a way that nothing else could. It was such a relief knowing that I could tackle any mess with ease. 

However, while the cleaning efficiency is spot on, there are a couple of downsides. One of the most frustrating aspects has been the time it takes for the cleaner to heat up and the steam to start flowing. Sometimes, it seems to take an eternity, especially when dealing with those pesky spots that require immediate attention. The cleaner also ran out of steam midway through my first use, which was a bit of a letdown. 

But overall, the Bissell Little Green HydroSteam Portable Carpet Cleaner has been a valuable addition to my cleaning arsenal. Its innovative technology truly shines when it comes to tackling tough stains and messes. Despite the few drawbacks, its effectiveness in cleaning carpets, upholstery, and even more makes it a tool I wouldn’t mind investing in for future home cleaning endeavors. 


### [Ewbank 280 Cascade Manual Carpet Shampooer: Powerful Carpet Cleaning Solution](https://serp.ly/amazon/Hand+Held+Shampooer?utm\_term=ewbank-280-cascade-manual-carpet-shampooer-powerful-carpet-cleaning-solution)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Hand+Held+Shampooer?utm_term=ewbank-280-cascade-manual-carpet-shampooer-powerful-carpet-cleaning-solution"><img alt="ewbank-280-cascade-manual-carpet-shampooer-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ewbank-280-cascade-manual-carpet-shampooer-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Just last week, I had the opportunity to use the Ewbank Cascade manual carpet shampooer. One of the highlights of my experience was its lightweight design, making it easy to maneuver through my living space. However, I found cleaning the stairs a bit more challenging as it's a bit difficult to reach certain areas, and the suction wasn't strong enough to lift all the dirt. Another issue was the cleaning fluid's even application - it seemed to spill out the sides and onto my floor a few times, making the cleaning process a little messier than I would've liked. 

On the other hand, I appreciated the fact that the Cascade is non-electric, making it safe and easy to store in my garage. The trigger release and telescopic handle were quite easy to operate, although there was a bit of frustration when the handle wouldn't lock in place. But overall, the product gets the job done, and I was pleased with the results on my rug's appearance. Just give it a little extra elbow grease and patience sometimes, and you'll have a sparkling clean surface in no time. 


### [McCulloch MC1230 Handheld Shampooer for Any Mess](https://serp.ly/amazon/Hand+Held+Shampooer?utm\_term=mcculloch-mc1230-handheld-shampooer-for-any-mess)

I've been using the McCulloch Handheld Steam Cleaner for a few weeks now and I must say, it's been a game-changer for my cleaning routine. The steam is powerful enough to tackle any stubborn messes, like hardened stains on my countertops or built-up grime on my shower tiles. Plus, the lockable steam trigger lets me steam longer without holding the trigger, which is perfect for those marathon cleaning sessions. 

One thing I appreciate about this product is that it doesn't require me to use harsh chemicals to sanitize my surfaces. It's a natural and eco-friendly way to keep my home clean and fresh. The 6 oz. water tank heats up in just 3 minutes and provides up to 10 minutes of continuous steam, which is more than enough time to get the job done efficiently. 

I love that this steam cleaner comes with 11 versatile accessories, including an attachable extension hose for those hard-to-reach spots. The 15-foot power cord makes it easy for me to move around my home without worrying about finding a power outlet, and the safety certifications ensure that I can use it without any concerns. 

However, there are a couple of downsides to this product. Firstly, it doesn't have any temperature control, so if you need a higher or lower heat setting, you're out of luck. Additionally, the 8-10 minute steam operating time might be too short for some users, but I've found it's more than enough for my daily cleaning needs. 

Overall, the McCulloch Handheld Steam Cleaner has made a significant impact in my cleaning routine, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a natural and efficient way to keep their home sparkling clean.

I recently tried the Bissell Pet Stain Eraser PowerBrush, and I must say, it's been a lifesaver for pet owners like myself. The machine is super easy to use and lightweight, making cleaning up after messy pets a breeze. One of the best features of this cleaner is its cordless design, which allows for more freedom and flexibility in cleaning various areas without being tethered to an outlet. 

The rotating DirtLifter PowerBrush is a game-changer, effortlessly tackling tough stains and pet messes. However, I did notice that the battery life could be a bit disappointing, as it ran out after about 15 minutes of use. But again, this cleaner is designed for spot-cleaning, not for large areas, so it's not a major drawback. 

Overall, the Bissell Pet Stain Eraser PowerBrush is a must-have for pet owners who want an effective and easy-to-use cleaning solution. While it may not be as powerful as some professional-grade carpet cleaners, it's perfect for tackling pet stains and keeping your home clean and fresh.

This compact steamer comes equipped with 10 attachments, ensuring versatility and providing the right tool for every job. Its compact size and ease of use make cleaning a breeze, but it may feel a bit heavy after extended use, as the water will run out before your arm grows tired. 

Some users have reported issues with attachments melting or falling apart, so be cautious and avoid using them on painted surfaces or areas exposed to direct sunlight. Additionally, note that the steam cleaner requires frequent refilling, which can be somewhat bothersome, especially if you're tackling larger cleaning tasks. However, the machine's lightweight design and affordable price may make it worth considering for those who are looking for a versatile and easy-to-use cleaning tool without breaking the bank.

In my experience, it's great for sanitizing baseboard fins and even cleaning blinds, drapes, and curtains. It's also incredibly versatile, allowing me to deep clean my home without resorting to harsh chemicals. 

However, there are a few drawbacks. The smaller capacity of the water tank means I have to refill it more often than I'd like. Additionally, while the steam cleaner is lightweight, the noise it produces can be quite annoying at times, especially when in use for extended periods. 

Overall, the DBTech Handheld Multi-Purpose Pressurized Steam Cleaner is a valuable addition to my cleaning arsenal. Its powerful steam, reachability, and versatility make it a reliable and efficient tool for cleaning various surfaces. Despite its minor drawbacks, I'm confident that this steam cleaner will continue to make my daily cleaning routine much easier and more effective.

The cordless convenience has made cleaning carpets and upholstery a breeze, especially in hard-to-reach areas. I've found that its lightweight design has made it incredibly easy to maneuver, which is perfect for me as I'm pretty clumsy. 

The OXY formula included with the machine has proven to do a fantastic job of tackling messes. I've been able to clean fresh stains with ease, and I appreciate that the formula is stored in the machine itself, making it readily available whenever I need it. The spot cleaning brush that comes with the machine does a great job of removing stubborn dirt and stains, which is a major plus for me. 

My only gripe is that I wish it had a more powerful suction. Sometimes, I find that I have to go over the same spot multiple times to get it completely clean. Overall, though, it's a high-quality machine that has made my life a whole lot easier when dealing with pet stains. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and easy-to-use spot carpet cleaner. 


### [Bissell SpotClean Professional: Corded Hand Held Carpet Shampooer](https://serp.ly/amazon/Hand+Held+Shampooer?utm\_term=bissell-spotclean-professional-corded-hand-held-carpet-shampooer)

Firstly, setting it up was a breeze - no tools or complicated manuals required. Just plug it in, fill the clean water/formula tank, and you're all set to go. 

The corded SpotClean Pro is incredibly versatile, making it perfect for cleaning a range of surfaces. I loved using the powerful suction to remove even the most stubborn stains, from upholstery to carpets and even my children's artworks on the walls. The machine's smart design features a 6-inch brush tool for cleaning stairs and area rugs, as well as a 3-inch brush tool for tackling tough spots. 

One of my favorite things about this machine is its size - it's large enough to minimize the need for frequent tank refills, so you're not constantly stopping to refill. The no-nonsense approach to cleaning means that you can focus more on getting the job done, rather than fiddling with attachments and accessories.

One feature that stood out to me was the OXY formula, which instantly removed tough pet messes and embedded dirt. The fact that I could store the formula in the machine was a game-changer, as I didn't have to mix anything or worry about water contamination. I noticed that the cleaner worked effectively on upholstery and area rugs as well, making it a versatile tool for tackling pet messes in various areas of the house. 

However, I did encounter a minor issue with the hose sealing. There were moments when the water would leak out of the hose connection, which I found a little inconvenient. It would be helpful if Bissell could improve the sealing mechanism to prevent this from happening. 

Overall, I'm satisfied with my experience using the Bissell Pet Stain Eraser PowerBrush Portable Carpet Cleaner. While it may be less powerful than a professional grade carpet cleaner, it does its job effectively and efficiently when it comes to cleaning up pet messes. I'm glad that with this machine, I can tackle pet stains with ease, while also helping support the BISSELL Pet Foundation's efforts to save homeless pets.
