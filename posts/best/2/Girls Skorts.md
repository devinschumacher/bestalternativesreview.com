### [Cat & Jack Pink Pull-On Knit Skort for Girls - XL](https://serp.ly/amazon/Girls+Skorts?utm\_term=cat-jack-pink-pull-on-knit-skort-for-girls-xl)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Girls+Skorts?utm_term=cat-jack-pink-pull-on-knit-skort-for-girls-xl"><img alt="girls-knit-skort-cat-jack-pink-xl-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/girls-knit-skort-cat-jack-pink-xl-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a mom, I've been on the hunt for a versatile, comfortable piece of clothing for my little girl. Cat & Jack's Girls' Knit Skort in Pink caught my eye because of the striped print and the hidden shorts, which I knew would provide extra coverage and a more polished look. 

My daughter loved the knit skort - she wore it every day during the summer and even into the fall. I appreciated the full elastic waistband with a flexible drawstring, which offered a comfortable and stay-put fit. The soft fabric blend was a hit, and the hidden shorts allowed for easy movement and added coverage. I appreciate that the skort can be dressed up or down with various activewear pieces. 

One con was the string getting sucked in the waistband at times. Additionally, there were raveled ends on the string, which, although it helps with waist adjustments, wasn't the most visually appealing. However, these were minor issues compared to the overall positive experience with this product. I can't wait to add more of these skorts in different colors to our wardrobe for next season!
