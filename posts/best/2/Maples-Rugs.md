### [Maples Tribal Design Tufted Accent Rug in Red/Gold](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Maples+Rugs?utm\_term=maples-tribal-design-tufted-accent-rug-in-red-gold)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Maples+Rugs?utm_term=maples-tribal-design-tufted-accent-rug-in-red-gold"><img alt="maples-tribal-design-tufted-accent-rug-red-gold-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/maples-tribal-design-tufted-accent-rug-red-gold-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Maples Tribal Design Tufted Accent Rug in red and gold, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations. The vibrant colors and intricate geometric pattern instantly brought life to my living space. 

One of the standout features of this rug is its durability. Despite being made of nylon pile, it has held up wonderfully without showing signs of wear and tear. I also appreciate the latex backing, which keeps the rug firmly in place and prevents it from slipping. This has been particularly beneficial in my home office, where the rug serves as a stylish addition to the room without causing any tripping hazards. 

When it comes to maintenance, the Maples Rug is a dream come true. It's machine washable, which means no more dreaded rug-cleaning sessions! The colors remain vibrant even after multiple washes, and the rug retains its shape effortlessly. 

However, there were a couple of cons as well. Although the rug is skid-resistant, it tends to bunch up in certain areas, which can be a bit bothersome. Additionally, the rug's thinness can make it feel less luxurious underfoot compared to thicker rugs. 

Overall, the Maples Tribal Design Tufted Accent Rug has been a fantastic addition to my home. Its combination of style, durability, and ease of maintenance has made it a worthwhile investment.

I recently came across the Maples Traditional Minerva Beige Multi Floral Indoor Accent Rug, and I must say, it's been a game-changer in the way I style my home. 

First things first, the quality of the rug is top-notch. Crafted with 100% polyester yarn, this rug is incredibly durable and resistant to fading, which is perfect for areas that see heavy foot traffic.

I appreciate the 100% nylon pile, which not only looks fantastic but also ensures durability and fade resistance that lasts long-term. The latex backing works wonders in preventing slipping and prevents the need for additional rug pads. 

One major drawback I've encountered is the occasional issue with customers receiving rugs shorter than expected. This left a few customers feeling disappointed and frustrated, though the issue appeared to be resolved in some of their subsequent rug orders. I also found the rug to be a bit thinner than anticipated, but considering the great prices and vivid colors, it's a small compromise I'm willing to make.

### [Maples Rugs Rebecca 26: Easy-to-Clean Kitchen Rug](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Maples+Rugs?utm\_term=maples-rugs-rebecca-26-easy-to-clean-kitchen-rug)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Maples+Rugs?utm_term=maples-rugs-rebecca-26-easy-to-clean-kitchen-rug"><img alt="maples-rugs-kitchen-rug-rebecca-27" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/maples-rugs-kitchen-rug-rebecca-27/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Ever since I first unrolled the Maples Rugs Kitchen Rug Rebecca 26 in my kitchen, it's been a constant reminder of the joy of living. I've found myself taking a moment each day to admire the abstract pattern on this modern carpet, a blend of the old and new, a symbol of my love for timeless style. 

The 100% Polyester pile has not only made a beautiful rug, but it's also been a lifesaver in terms of stain and spill resistance. I've accidentally spilled all sorts of things on this rug, from wine to ketchup, and the Maples Rugs has always bounced back, leaving no damage behind. The low profile of the rug has been a blessing for placing it in different settings, and I appreciate that it's easy to clean and machine wash. 

However, I have to admit that there have been a few drawbacks to using this rug. The skid-resistant latex backing is useful, but in high-traffic areas, it has proven to be a bit of a hazard. There have been a few instances where I've had to be careful not to slip on the rug. The rug's durability has been a mixed bag as well. It seems to have held up well against the wear and tear of everyday life, but there's a nagging suspicion that it might not be the most long-lasting rug on the market. 

Overall, though, the Maples Rugs Kitchen Rug Rebecca 26 has been a delight to use in my kitchen. Its timeless design, stain and spill resistance, and the ease with which I can care for it are all features that I appreciate. Despite the occasional slip and some concerns about its long-term durability, I've found that this rug has been worth the investment.

Living with a Maples Highland rug has been a breath of fresh air for my living space. This rug, with its unique textured print and vibrant red color, adds an instant punch of style and personality to any room. The durability of this nylon rug, combined with the non-skid latex backing, provides a sense of solidity and safety. 

One aspect I particularly appreciate is the rug's Standard 100 by OEKO-TEX certification, which ensures that the fibers and accessories used have been thoroughly tested and verified as free from harmful substances. This not only adds to my peace of mind but also aligns with my eco-consciousness. 

However, my only critique is that the rug does not have a slip-resistant backing and requires a rug pad for better grip on smooth surfaces. Despite this, the rug's 0.375" pile height and intricate pattern make it a showstopper in any home decor piece.

Another thing that impressed me is the variety of sizes available. I bought a smaller rug to place at the entryway of my home, and it fits perfectly. The rugs also come in different colors, which allows me to choose the one that best matches my existing decor.

Synthetic fibers like nylon and polyester are also used for their durability and affordability. 


### Design and Colors

Maples Rugs come in a wide range of patterns, from bold geometric designs to intricate floral and abstract patterns.
