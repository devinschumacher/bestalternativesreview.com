At first, I was a bit skeptical about the cage's durability, but once I got it set up, I was impressed by how sturdy it was. The 0.4" thickened metal tubes were definitely deformation-resistant and chew-resistant, which gave me peace of mind. 

One of the things I loved the most about this crate was its compact size when folded. It was so easy to store and transport, which is a big plus for a pet owner like me who's always on the go. The lockable doors were a great addition, too. It made it convenient for me to interact with my dog, while also ensuring he couldn't escape whenever he wanted to. 

Another feature that stood out was the 360-deg rotating universal wheels. It made moving the crate around my home a breeze. I also appreciated the pull-out tray, which made cleaning up after my dog a lot easier. The washable tray with the 1.2" deep design prevented any spills when I removed it.

Overall, I'm happy with my purchase, and I'd definitely recommend it to other dog owners looking for a reliable and durable dog crate.

One of the highlights I appreciate is the ease of assembly, with no tools required. The crates vary in size to accommodate pets of different lifestyles, making this the perfect addition to any busy home. Moreover, the electro-coat finish adds a rust-resistant touch, prolonging the life of the crate for both indoor and outdoor use. 

However, a downside that has become apparent over the past few months is that the wire on the lower level seems to be unstable. This forces my dog to step carefully and hesitates momentarily when entering the crate.

However, prior to purchasing this crate, it's advisable to verify the size specification. Although it accommodates pets up to 40 lbs, the actual size can vary depending on the breed and size of the dog.

In conclusion, I would wholeheartedly endorse the Homey Pet Inc Gold-colored Dog Crate for anyone looking for a strong, comfy, and hassle-free crate for their pet.

However, there were a couple of drawbacks, especially when it came to maintaining and storing the crate. Although the latched door gives my dog a sense of security, I found it a bit difficult to open while using the handle. Additionally, while the crate was easy to set up initially, folding it back down required a bit of muscle. The handle's flimsy construction also made it challenging to carry around. Overall, I believe the Boots & Barkley Wire Collapsible Dog Crate is a good investment for pet owners seeking a practical solution for crate training.

### [EcoFlex Dog Crate with Stainless Steel Latch and Brushed Steel Spindles](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Metal+Dog+Crate?utm\_term=ecoflex-dog-crate-with-stainless-steel-latch-and-brushed-steel-spindles)

I was initially drawn to the elegant design of the New Age Pet EcoFlex Dog Crate. As an antique white piece, it blended seamlessly in our home while still serving as a functional pet essential. The eco-friendly construction was a great perk, as it's made of a non-toxic recycled plastic-wood polymer composite material that doesn't warp, crack or split. 

Assembly was a breeze, with no tools required. However, the durability left something to be desired. The bars and spindles seemed insubstantial, which became apparent when our dog made quick work of the crate. The plastic screws holding the latches also proved inadequate, causing frustration both for us and our pup. 

One thing I appreciated was the easy, no-tools assembly. The crate looked stylish and seemed sturdy when we first put it together, but the reality soon proved otherwise. Despite its small size, the material bent and warped under the dog's force. Luckily, it was easy to set up and take down, which made for a convenient storage solution. 

Overall, I found the New Age Pet EcoFlex Dog Crate to be an attractive option for an antique-inspired design. However, the durability and structure of the crate let it down, making it a less-than-ideal choice for dogs who might destroy or manipulate it. While the easy assembly and eco-friendly nature of the product were noteworthy, I wouldn't recommend this particular product for a pet in need of a secure and long-lasting crate.

## Buyer's Guide

A metal dog crate is a practical and durable option for pet owners who want to provide a safe and secure space for their furry friends. These crates are available in various sizes and designs, making it easy to find one that suits your dog's needs and your home's aesthetic. In this buyer's guide, we will discuss the essential features and considerations to help you make an informed decision when purchasing a metal dog crate. 


### Size

The size of the metal dog crate is crucial, as it should accommodate your dog comfortably without being too large to make the crate unstable. Measure your dog from the tip of their nose to the base of their tail, and add 2-4 inches to ensure there is enough space for movement. Consider the height as well, as your dog should be able to stand up without hitting their head on the roof. Crates come in various sizes to accommodate dogs of all sizes.

### Material

Metal dog crates are made from different materials, such as aluminum, steel, or wire mesh. The choice of material depends on your requirements and budget. Aluminum crates are lightweight and rust-resistant, while steel crates are more durable and better for larger dogs. Wire mesh crates provide better ventilation, but the spacing should be close enough to prevent your dog from escaping or their paws from getting injured. Choose a crate made from high-quality materials that can withstand wear and tear and are safe for your pet. 


### Design and Portability

Consider the design of the metal dog crate, as it may influence its ease of use and portability. Foldable crates can be disassembled and stored when not in use, making them suitable for small spaces. Crates with detachable trays make cleaning easier, while crates with dividers allow you to adjust the size as your dog grows. Look for crates with handles or wheels for better mobility, especially if you plan to travel with your pet. A well-designed and portable crate can improve your pet's comfort and convenience.

### Durability and Safety

Your metal dog crate should be durable and safe for your pet. High-quality crates have sturdy welds and no sharp edges or protrusions. The locking mechanism should be secure and easy to use, preventing your dog from escaping. Look for crates with ventilation on all sides to ensure proper airflow, and choose one with a well-fitting door to prevent drafts and insects from entering. A well-designed and sturdy metal dog crate will provide a safe and comfortable space for your pet and last for years.

Begin by attaching the floor or tray to the crate's base, following the manufacturer's directions. Once the floor or tray is securely fastened, attach the walls and corners to the base, ensuring that each piece is aligned correctly and tightly fastened. Some crates may require additional stabilizing bars or struts to provide added support and stability.
