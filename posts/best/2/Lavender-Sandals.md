### [New York & Company Liana Sandals in Lavender - Size 6](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lavender+Sandals?utm\_term=new-york-company-liana-sandals-in-lavender-size-6)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lavender+Sandals?utm_term=new-york-company-liana-sandals-in-lavender-size-6"><img alt="womens-new-york-and-company-liana-sandals-in-lavender-size-7" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/womens-new-york-and-company-liana-sandals-in-lavender-size-7/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried on the Liana sandals in a lovely lavender color from New York and Company. The first thing that caught my eye was the intricate flower applique that added a touch of elegance to the design. The t-strap style added a chic touch to an otherwise simple sandal. 

However, the experience wasn't as pleasant as I had hoped. The biggest issue I faced was the comfort level, which seemed to be a major concern for several other users too. The piece that goes in between the toes was incredibly uncomfortable, making it difficult to walk in them. Even though I love the color, the discomfort outweighed the prettiness for me, and I found myself rarely wearing them. 

Despite the design, the quality also left a lot to be desired. Some users reported that their sandals chipped after just a few weeks, which is definitely not something I want to experience with a shoe. 

On the positive side, the sandals looked exactly as they did in the picture, with the color being true to the image. They also seemed to be well-made initially, feeling a bit stiff but becoming more pliable after some wear. 

Overall, the Liana sandals from New York and Company have their pros and cons. While the style and color were charming, the comfort and quality issues were significant turn-offs. 


### [Lavender Naia Sandals by Miz Mooz](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lavender+Sandals?utm\_term=lavender-naia-sandals-by-miz-mooz)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lavender+Sandals?utm_term=lavender-naia-sandals-by-miz-mooz"><img alt="womens-new-york-and-company-naia-sandals-in-lavender-size-10" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/womens-new-york-and-company-naia-sandals-in-lavender-size-10/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

These elegant Naia sandals from Women's New York and Company are a timeless addition to any wardrobe. Featuring a flat slide design, they're perfect for both casual and professional settings. A stylish twist comes from the metallic horsebit hardware detail, adding a chic touch. 

The faux leather upper is both comfortable and versatile, while the faux leather-lined footbed ensures a pleasant shoe feel. The slip-on design provides ease in entering the shoe and the rubber outsole ensures durability. 

In the Lavender size 9, this Naia sandal boasts a soft, feminine color that adds a touch of sophistication to any outfit. 


### [Luxurious Lavender Slide Sandals for Comfort and Shock Absorption](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lavender+Sandals?utm\_term=luxurious-lavender-slide-sandals-for-comfort-and-shock-absorption)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lavender+Sandals?utm_term=luxurious-lavender-slide-sandals-for-comfort-and-shock-absorption"><img alt="seychelles-simply-the-best-slide-sandal-in-lavender-v-leather-at-nordstrom-size-7-6" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/seychelles-simply-the-best-slide-sandal-in-lavender-v-leather-at-nordstrom-size-7-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Sliding into my day with a touch of luxury, the Seychelles Simply The Best Slide Sandal in Lavender V-Leather has been an unexpected delight. The chunky knotted upper, made of puffy tubular straps, adds a playful touch that sets these sandals apart. Even though the strap can feel a bit tight at first, I've found that ordering a half size up works wonders. 

The cushiony 1-inch platform with high-quality shock absorption has made walking a breeze, even on long days. The luxuriously soft vegan leather not only feels sumptuous against my skin but also offers impressive support. However, the color looked a bit different in person, with the blue coming across as darker than my expectations. 

Overall, these sandals have a unique appeal that combines comfort and style, and they are perfect for dressing up or going for that laid-back boho look. The only drawback is the tightness of the strap, which may require some adjustment initially. But once you've got these on, you'll be sliding into happiness every time you wear them. 


### [Slip-on Lavender Sandals with EVA Footbed for Comfort](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lavender+Sandals?utm\_term=slip-on-lavender-sandals-with-eva-footbed-for-comfort)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lavender+Sandals?utm_term=slip-on-lavender-sandals-with-eva-footbed-for-comfort"><img alt="cougar-pool-party-10-womens-lavender-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cougar-pool-party-10-womens-lavender-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Cougar Pool Party 10 Women's Lavender shoes, with a 3.9 rating and 11 reviews, are a cool option for those looking for a stylish and comfortable sandal for their next pool party. These sandals come in lavender, making them a great choice for a summer wardrobe. 

One of the best features of these shoes is the molded EVA construction, providing a cushy, soft footbed for all-day comfort. They also slip-on easily, making them a convenient option. However, some users have mentioned that they tend to run true to size for most, but as a rule, half sizes should size up. 

Overall, these sandals offer a great combination of style and comfort, perfect for a fun and relaxing pool party experience. 


### [Madden Girl Lavender Dress Sandal: Chic and Comfortable](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lavender+Sandals?utm\_term=madden-girl-lavender-dress-sandal-chic-and-comfortable)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lavender+Sandals?utm_term=madden-girl-lavender-dress-sandal-chic-and-comfortable"><img alt="madden-girl-dixcy-slide-6-womens-lavender-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/madden-girl-dixcy-slide-6-womens-lavender-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried the Dixcy Slide 6 Women's Lavender sandals from Madden Girl, and let me tell you, they were a game-changer for my summer wardrobe! These slip-on sandals boasted a flirty appeal with their chic braided straps and stylish square toe. I appreciated that they were made in the USA or imported, giving them an authentic feel. 

One of the best features was the polyurethane sole, which provided both comfort and support. Although I did notice that they required a bit of breaking in, they soon became my go-to shoes for every occasion. 

The sandals were true to size and easy to walk in, even though I have a wide foot. The lavender color was perfect for adding a pop of color to my summer outfits, and I was delighted to receive numerous compliments on them. 

The only downside was the limited availability, as they quickly became a favorite among my friends. I highly recommend getting your hands on these stylish sandals before they're all gone! 


### [Lavender-Embellished Blue By Betsey Johnson Rebel Sandals](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lavender+Sandals?utm\_term=lavender-embellished-blue-by-betsey-johnson-rebel-sandals)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lavender+Sandals?utm_term=lavender-embellished-blue-by-betsey-johnson-rebel-sandals"><img alt="rebel-lavender-sandals-betsey-johnson-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rebel-lavender-sandals-betsey-johnson-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a lover of Betsey Johnson's designs, I was excited to try the Rebel Lavender Sandals. The sandals feature a lovely lavender hue with a touch of sparkle from the rhinestone decorations on the straps. The kitten heel was a charming addition, adding a touch of sophistication to the shoes. 

Upon trying them for the first time, I noticed the soft synthetic lining and the lightly padded insole. However, I also stumbled upon an issue with the heels: the adjustable buckle closure on the ankle strap. Although the idea of customizing the fit sounded appealing, in reality, the design was not as comfortable as I had hoped. The straps twisting and digging into my heel was quite uncomfortable, and no matter how loose or tight I adjusted the buckle, it wasn't the perfect fit. 

As I continued to wear these sandals, I wished for better support and comfort from the heels. In the end, while the sandals were visually appealing, the shoe's fit and design were not as great as I had hoped. 


### [Seychelles Leeward Leather Sandals - Lavender Color](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lavender+Sandals?utm\_term=seychelles-leeward-leather-sandals-lavender-color)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lavender+Sandals?utm_term=seychelles-leeward-leather-sandals-lavender-color"><img alt="seychelles-leeward-leather-sandal-6-lavender-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/seychelles-leeward-leather-sandal-6-lavender-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Seychelles Leeward Leather Sandal in Lavender showcases a chic and versatile design for every female. Featuring elastic, rucher leather straps, it provides a custom fit that adapts flawlessly to your foot. Additionally, the pillow-like cushioning on the ball of the foot ensures long-lasting convenience throughout the day. 

Its timeless aesthetic, which is reminiscent of vintage designs, adds an elegant touch to any ensemble. Although a few customers noted that the sandal's size was slightly larger than anticipated, the combination of comfort and style compensates for this minor inconvenience. 

Weighing just a fraction, these sandals have a refined metallic sheen that makes them a coveted choice for both summer soirees and casual outings. 


### [Lavender Linette Women's Sandals - Size 11](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lavender+Sandals?utm\_term=lavender-linette-womens-sandals-size-11)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lavender+Sandals?utm_term=lavender-linette-womens-sandals-size-11"><img alt="womens-linette-sandals-lilac-size-12" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/womens-linette-sandals-lilac-size-12/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Fashion to Figure Wide Width Lavender Sandals in Size 12](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lavender+Sandals?utm\_term=fashion-to-figure-wide-width-lavender-sandals-in-size-12)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lavender+Sandals?utm_term=fashion-to-figure-wide-width-lavender-sandals-in-size-12"><img alt="womens-fashion-to-figure-hilari-wide-width-dress-sandals-in-lavender-w-size-13" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/womens-fashion-to-figure-hilari-wide-width-dress-sandals-in-lavender-w-size-13/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a fashion enthusiast, I recently tried on a pair of wide width heels from the Hilari Wide Width Dress Sandals collection. The first thing that caught my eye was the stylish square toe design, which added an elegant touch to the shoe. The 4.5-inch heel height made me feel tall and confident, perfect for an evening out. 

Wearing these sandals with a dress was a no-brainer, they looked absolutely fabulous. The lavender color added a touch of elegance to my outfit, making me feel like I was walking on clouds. The strappy accents were a great addition to the overall design, and they made the sandals stand out in a crowd. 

The shoes were super comfortable, even with the tall heel. The wide width design ensured that my feet had ample space, preventing any discomfort during the day. However, I found the sizing to be slightly off - the size 12 was larger than expected. Keep that in mind before making your purchase. 

Overall, these shoes are a great addition to any wardrobe, especially for those seeking stylish wide width heels. They effortlessly elevate any outfit, making them a worthwhile investment. 


### [Ninety Union Lavender Sandals for Women Size 8](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lavender+Sandals?utm\_term=ninety-union-lavender-sandals-for-women-size-8)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lavender+Sandals?utm_term=ninety-union-lavender-sandals-for-women-size-8"><img alt="womens-ninety-union-tampa-sandals-in-purple-size-9" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/womens-ninety-union-tampa-sandals-in-purple-size-9/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Ninety Union Tampa sandals for women in purple size 8 offer a delightful blend of style and comfort. Featuring a clear upper supported by a synthetic outsole, these sandals boast a unique chain-linked buckle that adds a touch of chic to the overall design. 

While the minimal heel and synthetic sole make them an excellent choice for everyday wear, users have reported mixed experiences with comfort and sizing. Some find the shoes to be uncomfortable, with one even mentioning blisters, while others appreciate the cute and classy appearance, and find the shoes to be suitable for both day and night wear. 

Overall, these sandals make a stylish addition to any summer wardrobe, but potential buyers should consider the sizing and comfort concerns before making a purchase. 


### [Adidas Lavender Platform Slide Sandal for Women - Size 8](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lavender+Sandals?utm\_term=adidas-lavender-platform-slide-sandal-for-women-size-8)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lavender+Sandals?utm_term=adidas-lavender-platform-slide-sandal-for-women-size-8"><img alt="adidas-adilette-platform-slide-sandal-womens-lavender-size-8-sandals-platform-slide-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/adidas-adilette-platform-slide-sandal-womens-lavender-size-8-sandals-platform-slide-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

With lavender tones that perfectly complement a summer wardrobe, the Adidas Adilette platform slide sandals capture the essence of carefree relaxation and chic versatility. Their classic design and comfortable sporty flair make these shoes a must-have for casual warm weather ensembles. Featuring Adidas' signature cushioning technology, these sandals are not only fashionable but also provide optimal comfort and support for your feet. 

The major selling point for these sandals is their platform design, which adds an extra level of height and style. The chunky platform adds to the overall aesthetic and provides a more elevated look. However, it's essential to remember that the sizing of these shoes may run a little large, so it's recommended to try them on if possible. As they run large, it is advised to choose a size smaller than your usual shoe size. 

One of the main complaints users have is the size inconsistency. It appears that the size 8 may be a more suitable size for those with average width feet, but the sizing chart needs to be adjusted for those who may have narrow or slightly wider feet. There seems to be a bit of confusion around the actual fit, with some users finding the sizing is better suited to male feet. 

Despite the minor sizing issues, the overall quality and comfort of these sandals are generally praised by customers. The platform design adds extra cushioning, making these shoes ideal for long periods of walking. The materials used are of a high standard, giving a durable and versatile feel to the sandals. The platform slide sandals are a great summertime accessory or for those seeking a casual, yet stylish, day-to-day shoe. 


### [Journee Signature Lilac Leather Sandals](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lavender+Sandals?utm\_term=journee-signature-lilac-leather-sandals)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lavender+Sandals?utm_term=journee-signature-lilac-leather-sandals"><img alt="womens-journee-signature-cendi-sandals-lilac-size-12-leather-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/womens-journee-signature-cendi-sandals-lilac-size-12-leather-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using these Journee Signature Cendi Slip-On sandals for a few weeks now, and let me tell you, they've been a game-changer to my shoe collection. The first thing that stood out to me was the 4 mm Tru Comfort Foam footbed. I've always been one to gravitate towards shoes with extra cushioning, and these sandals were more comfortable than I could have ever hoped for. 

Though they are a slip-on style, the padded strap provides extra support without causing the sandals to feel too bulky. These Journee Signature Cendi shoes make sure that I'm comfortable all night long. And let's not forget about the genuine leather upper! It adds a touch of sophistication and a splash of personality to my outfits. 

However, there was one downside: the 1-inch block heel can be tricky for some, especially if you're using the sandals for long periods of standing or walking. But, it's a trade-off I gladly made for the overall comfort and style that these Journee Signature Cendi sandals provide. 


### [Jessica Simpson Jaeya Strappy Lavender Rose Dress Sandals](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lavender+Sandals?utm\_term=jessica-simpson-jaeya-strappy-lavender-rose-dress-sandals)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lavender+Sandals?utm_term=jessica-simpson-jaeya-strappy-lavender-rose-dress-sandals"><img alt="jessica-simpson-jaeya-strappy-dress-sandals-lavender-rose-size-7m-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/jessica-simpson-jaeya-strappy-dress-sandals-lavender-rose-size-7m-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Jaeya strappy sandals by Jessica Simpson are an elegant and chic addition to any party outfit. Crafted with a thin strappy upper and a tall heel, they have a sparkling touch with rhinestone accents that add glamour to the occasion. The ankle buckle strap ensures a secure fit, perfect for those dance-worthy events. 

As someone who's tried the Jaeya sandals, I can say that the comfort level is a bit hit or miss. The first time I wore them, I felt like walking on clouds due to the soft footbed. However, the second time I wore them, I experienced some discomfort in my ankles. It seems that the ankle buckle may be too tight for some. 

Another positive aspect of these sandals is their versatility. Although they're party shoes, they can be dressed down with jeans and a t-shirt for a more casual look. The rhinestone accents give them a touch of elegance that makes them stand out. 

On the downside, the construction quality seems a bit lackluster. The rhinestones might fall off after a few wears, which is disappointing considering the price point. The glue holding the stones in place also seems to lose its grip over time. 

In conclusion, the Jaeya strappy sandals by Jessica Simpson are a beautiful and eye-catching addition to your footwear collection. If you're looking for a comfortable fit and aren't too bothered by the occasional rhinestone fallout, these sandals might be the perfect match for your party wardrobe.

### [Allegra K Strappy Purple Lavender Sandals](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lavender+Sandals?utm\_term=allegra-k-strappy-purple-lavender-sandals)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lavender+Sandals?utm_term=allegra-k-strappy-purple-lavender-sandals"><img alt="allegra-k-womens-strappy-clear-strap-flip-flops-wedge-sandals-purple-8-6" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/allegra-k-womens-strappy-clear-strap-flip-flops-wedge-sandals-purple-8-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The clear straps and open-toe design gave the sandals a sleek and sophisticated look, perfect for a night out or a day at the beach. The strappy design also allowed for flexibility and comfort while walking, making these a great choice for long strolls. 

However, the 3-inch heel height was a bit too much for me, causing some discomfort after a few hours of wearing. The faux leather vamp material was both stylish and durable, but I wish the outsole was made of a more breathable material, as it tended to get a bit sweaty during warmer days. 

Overall, these wedge sandals are a great choice for those looking for a stylish and comfortable pair of footwear. Just be aware that the high heel may cause some discomfort for those who are not used to wearing heels regularly. 


### [Madden Girl Gracy 10: Dark Lavender Lavender Sandals](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lavender+Sandals?utm\_term=madden-girl-gracy-10-dark-lavender-lavender-sandals)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Lavender+Sandals?utm_term=madden-girl-gracy-10-dark-lavender-lavender-sandals"><img alt="madden-girl-gracy-10-womens-dark-lavender-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/madden-girl-gracy-10-womens-dark-lavender-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When I spotted the Madden Girl Gracy Dress Sandals, my heart skipped a beat. I just couldn't resist the irresistible blend of dark lavender hues and their squared open-toe style. They were my dream summer footwear companions. 

And it felt like a dream at first. The slip-on styling with a braided front strap made them super comfy and stylish. But I noticed something was off as the day progressed—the cushioned insole started to feel uncomfortable. The shoe did not sit right, causing some discomfort. 

The footwear definitely made a style statement—the unique square open-toe design, and the chunky woven strap made everyone look twice. However, it was quite noticeable that the shoes were too large for my feet—which was a bummer given the gorgeous design. I should have sized down. 

Despite the initial disappointment, the Madden Girl Gracy Dress Sandals are still a sight to behold. With the right size, they could have been a perfect option for summer wear. Despite the discomfort, it's clear they are designed with a stylish and trendy aesthetic in mind. If you can find your perfect size, it's definitely worth a try.
