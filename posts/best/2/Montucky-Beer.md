I recently tried the New Holland Dragon's Milk Reserve and was not disappointed. This 11% ABV bourbon barrel-aged stout is a true masterpiece, with rich flavors of coffee, chocolate, and vanilla. 

The three-month stay in bourbon barrels really adds an extra layer of complexity, resulting in a legendary blend of flavor. While some reviews mention it being a bit hoppy, it definitely has a delightful sweetness and the unique taste of a well-crafted bourbon barrel-aged beer.

I recently discovered the delightful drafty kilt scotch ale, and it's been my go-to beverage since then. This full-bodied ale is just the right balance for me, without being too heavy or overpowering. I've fallen in love with its smokey, but not overwhelmingly so, flavor. It boasts a hint of sweetness, but isn't cloyingly sweet, which I appreciate in a glass of beer. 

What's intriguing about this drafty kilt scotch ale is its unique origin. Crafted with smoked malt in a challenging hop-growing climate, the Scottish brewers relied on this ingredient to add flavor and bitterness to their brews. This dark, malty ale is truly a hidden gem. The experience of drinking it feels like a special treat, transporting you to a time and place where beer was brewed with care and love for its rich, complex flavors.

I've only shared the details here, but there are so many more things to discover in the drafty kilt scotch ale. It's a standout in my eyes, and a true star among the beer varieties. 


### [Rocky Mountain Birch Beer - Montucky Beer (Zero Alcohol)](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Montucky+Beer?utm\_term=rocky-mountain-birch-beer-montucky-beer-zero-alcohol)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Montucky+Beer?utm_term=rocky-mountain-birch-beer-montucky-beer-zero-alcohol"><img alt="rocky-mountain-soda-boulder-birch-beer-12-0-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/rocky-mountain-soda-boulder-birch-beer-12-0-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Montucky Maple Stout Aged in Bourbon Barrels](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Montucky+Beer?utm\_term=montucky-maple-stout-aged-in-bourbon-barrels)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Montucky+Beer?utm_term=montucky-maple-stout-aged-in-bourbon-barrels"><img alt="kentucky-barrel-lexington-brewing-maple-stout-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/kentucky-barrel-lexington-brewing-maple-stout-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Imagine sitting down after a long day, ready to indulge in a rich and decadent craft beer. That's where the Kentucky Barrel Lexington Brewing Maple Stout comes in. This bold imperial stout, brewed with a touch of brown sugar, offers a depth of flavor unmatched by similar beers. What sets this stout apart is its unique aging process, which involves being decanted in a freshly decanted maple syrup bourbon barrel for an impressive 18 months. 

As a reviewer who's tried it, I appreciate the distinctive hints of roasted malt and cocoa in each sip. However, there's a catch - the sweetness can be almost overwhelming at times. While the maple syrup notes add a pleasant touch, the high sugar content can be too much for some palates. But the fact that this brew is a treat for the taste buds is a testament to the skill of the Kentucky Barrel Lexington Brewing team. 

At the end of the day, I believe that this Maple Stout has its fair share of pros and cons. For those who enjoy a bold, sweet stout, this beer could be a delightful surprise. But for those who prefer a more subtle, balanced flavor, it might be worth exploring other options. Nonetheless, for craft beer lovers who are always on the hunt for the next big thing, the Kentucky Barrel Lexington Brewing Maple Stout is certainly worth a try.

### [Golden Monkey Victory Beer 6-Pack, 12 oz Bottles](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Montucky+Beer?utm\_term=golden-monkey-victory-beer-6-pack-12-oz-bottles)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Montucky+Beer?utm_term=golden-monkey-victory-beer-6-pack-12-oz-bottles"><img alt="victory-beer-golden-monkey-6-pack-12-oz-bottles-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/victory-beer-golden-monkey-6-pack-12-oz-bottles-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Hey beer lovers! I tried this Golden Monkey 6-pack from Victory Brewing Company, and let me tell you, it was quite the experience. The beer itself is quite strong, with an ABV of 9.5%, so if you're not used to that, proceed with caution. But don't let that scare you away - the richness of German malts and Belgian yeast really shines through in this golden ale. 

One thing that stood out to me was how the fruity and herbal notes really played well together. The beer had a nice and light body, making it a great sipper. I also appreciated the 12 oz bottles, as it's the perfect size for me to enjoy alone or share with friends. 

Now, there were a few things that didn't quite live up to my expectations. Firstly, the government warning on the packaging was a bit of a downer. I get that it's important, but it's not something I usually see on a 6-pack. Secondly, some of my friends who didn't usually drink beers with such a high ABV found that it was a bit too much for them, which was surprising. 

Overall, I'd say the Golden Monkey is definitely worth a try if you're looking for a strong and flavorful beer. Just be sure to pace yourself and enjoy it responsibly! 


### [Montauk Pilsner - Crisp, Light, and Smooth Beer](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Montucky+Beer?utm\_term=montauk-pilsner-crisp-light-and-smooth-beer)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Montucky+Beer?utm_term=montauk-pilsner-crisp-light-and-smooth-beer"><img alt="montauk-pilsner-12oz-can-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/montauk-pilsner-12oz-can-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who's a firm believer in trying beers from various places, I recently decided to give Montauk Pilsner a shot while I was out running errands.

I've kept a couple of cans in my fridge ever since, savoring this flavorful brew on those days when I need a cold, satisfying drink.

It's one of those beers that you can rely on to quench your thirst without overwhelming your palate. The lack of overpowering flavors allows it to be a crowd pleaser, making it a perfect choice when you're hosting a get-together. 

The one downside is that Montauk Pilsner isn't particularly unique. It lacks the distinctive, memorable characteristics that often stand out in a craft brew. It's just, well, Montauk Pilsner. It's good, but it's not groundbreaking. However, for its consistency and reliability, it's worth a try. Whether you're a beer enthusiast or a casual drinker, this pilsner is sure to satisfy. 


### [Golden Montucky Beer: Victory Brewing](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Montucky+Beer?utm\_term=golden-montucky-beer-victory-brewing)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Montucky+Beer?utm_term=golden-montucky-beer-victory-brewing"><img alt="victory-golden-monkey-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/victory-golden-monkey-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I was introduced to Victory Golden Monkey by a friend who swore by its unique flavor and character. I decided to give it a try one evening, and let me tell you, it exceeded my expectations. The golden hue of the beer truly captured the essence of the mystical monkey it is named after. 

One feature that stood out to me was the spiced aroma. It was like a symphony of flavors, from fruity esters and banana, to clove and pepper notes, it was like taking a journey through the East. The taste was equally impressive. The alcohol presence was undeniably there, but it didn't overwhelm the taste buds. Instead, it provided a rich, warm backdrop for the medley of spices. 

However, one aspect I found slightly underwhelming was the bitterness. I'm usually a fan of a good balance of hops and malt, but I found this one to be a bit too on the sweeter side. Despite this, the overall enjoyment outweighed the bitterness factor for me.
