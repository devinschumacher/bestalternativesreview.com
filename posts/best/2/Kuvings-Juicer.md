### [Kuvings Gun Metal Whole Slow Juicer](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Kuvings+Juicer?utm\_term=kuvings-gun-metal-whole-slow-juicer)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Kuvings+Juicer?utm_term=kuvings-gun-metal-whole-slow-juicer"><img alt="kuvings-evo820gm-whole-slow-juicer-gun-metal-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/kuvings-evo820gm-whole-slow-juicer-gun-metal-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Kuvings EVO820GM Whole Slow Juicer in gun metal color, and I must say, it's been a total game-changer in my daily routine. I specifically love the low-speed masticating technology, as it extracts maximum vitamins, minerals, and enzymes without oxidizing the juice. It crushes ingredients gently and presses them to produce a high yield. 

One of my favorite features is its versatility, making it perfect for a variety of uses, including smoothies, baby food, nut milk, and sorbets. I've even been able to juice delicate herbs, berries, carrots, and apples effortlessly. With the powerful and efficient 240W motor, cleaning has become a breeze. 

Another highlight is the flap gate system that prevents pulp from getting stuck in the strainer. This feature makes it easy to clean up any residue. The juicer's eco-friendly design, complemented by its leather-like finish and streamlined style, feels luxurious and fits seamlessly into any kitchen. 

While I really love this product, there was one drawback that I noticed - the chrome plated drip-free juice spout can be a bit stubborn when it comes to dealing with certain ingredients like carrots. At times, I had to use the reverse switch to continue juicing. Furthermore, the juicer is not dishwasher safe, so cleaning requires manual intervention. 


### [Kuvings Elite Whole Slow Juicer C7000S, Silver](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Kuvings+Juicer?utm\_term=kuvings-elite-whole-slow-juicer-c7000s-silver)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Kuvings+Juicer?utm_term=kuvings-elite-whole-slow-juicer-c7000s-silver"><img alt="kuvings-bpa-free-c7000s-whole-slow-juicer-elite-silver-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/kuvings-bpa-free-c7000s-whole-slow-juicer-elite-silver-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Kuvings Slow Juicer Elite and was impressed by its efficiency and juicing capabilities. One thing that stood out to me was the wide chute, which saved me time from constantly having to cut up my fruits and veggies into smaller pieces. The juicer produced high-quality juice with minimal froth, making it a great addition to my morning routine. 

The low-speed masticating technology was a game-changer in retaining the maximum nutrients and enzymes in my juice, while also leaving a dry pulp. The versatile smart cap allowed me to create custom blends without worrying about spillage, and it made rinsing in between blends a breeze. 

The juicer was also built with durability in mind, featuring a stainless steel exterior that was easy to clean and dishwasher safe. It came with all the essentials, including a 13-oz. juice cup, pulp cup, cleaning tool, and a recipe book. However, I did notice that the juicer was a bit heavy and took up more counter space than I anticipated. I also had to be mindful not to overload the juicer, as it could cause the motor to strain. 

Overall, the Kuvings Slow Juicer Elite was a great investment for someone looking to make healthier juice choices at home. I highly recommend it for anyone who is interested in preserving nutrition and flavors in their juice.

Additionally, the low-speed gear reduction motor operates quietly and produces minimal vibration, a commendable feature for those who intend to use it in a residential setting.

However, there are a couple of minor drawbacks as well. Cleaning the filter, although not overly difficult, could have been quicker if the flip-lid was removable. Moreover, some fruits and vegetables, such as celery, can clog the waste trap when juicing, thus warranting caution in selecting the ingredients to be blended.

Despite these minor setbacks, the Kuvings CS600 Whole Slow Juicer is an efficient, potent, and quiet juicer that consistently produces high-quality juice, enabling me to savor the health advantages of juicing right at home.

### [Kuvings Whole Slow Juicer: Eco-Friendly and Compact Masticating Juicer](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Kuvings+Juicer?utm\_term=kuvings-whole-slow-juicer-eco-friendly-and-compact-masticating-juicer)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Kuvings+Juicer?utm_term=kuvings-whole-slow-juicer-eco-friendly-and-compact-masticating-juicer"><img alt="kuvings-whole-slow-juicer-champagne-gold-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/kuvings-whole-slow-juicer-champagne-gold-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

A few weeks ago, I decided to give the Kuvings whole slow juicer a try in my busy kitchen. As someone who values health and convenience, this juicer seemed like a perfect fit. The first thing I noticed when setting it up was its sleek design. The champagne gold color adds a touch of elegance to any kitchen countertop. 

The juicer's main highlight is its low-speed technology, which gently crushes fruits and vegetables for maximum extraction of minerals, enzymes, and vitamins. I found this feature particularly appealing as it preserves the nutrients in the juice without generating too much heat. The slow motor speed also means that the juice doesn't oxidize, ensuring a refreshing taste every time. 

Using the juicer was a breeze. The 3.2-inch feed chute allowed me to insert various ingredients without any hassle. The pulp outlet, with its large capacity, made cleaning a breeze, and the flap gate system added an extra layer of safety, preventing any accidents. 

However, there were a couple of drawbacks. The juicer is not dishwasher safe, which can be inconvenient for those with limited time. Additionally, the top lid is not removable, making cleaning a bit more challenging, especially when dealing with smaller sieve holes.
