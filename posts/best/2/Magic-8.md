The attention to detail in designing each trick was evident, making it not only enjoyable but also educational for the kids. 

One minor disappointment, however, was the lack of sturdy props in a couple of instances, such as the wooden box with a red scarf attached to the wand. It seemed not quite thought out, and could have made the overall toy more appealing to the audience with better props. 

Overall, this Deluxe Magic Set Toy is a fantastic addition to any 8-year-old's playroom that fosters a love for magic, learning, and imaginative play.
