Additionally, the stake that comes with the light can be a bit flimsy, causing it to fall over in the slightest breeze. I've managed to fix this by replacing the stake with a piece of sturdy rebar, but it would be great if the manufacturer could address this issue. Despite these minor concerns, I've found that this light adds a cozy ambiance to my outdoor area and I highly recommend it for anyone looking to enhance their landscape lighting.
