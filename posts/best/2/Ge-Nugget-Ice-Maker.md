### [GE Profile Opal Nugget Ice Maker Dispenser](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Ge+Nugget+Ice+Maker?utm\_term=ge-profile-opal-nugget-ice-maker-dispenser)

Switching from those hard and harsh ice cubes to the crunchy, soft, mouth-watering variety has never been easier - all thanks to GE Profile's Opal Nugget Ice Maker Dispenser in Satin Black. This countertop unit is a game-changer, especially during those parties and get-togethers. It runs quietly, producing up to 38lb of chewable nuggets per day - that's 1lb 9oz of ice per hour - just enough for your thirsty crowd. 

One of the standouts for me was the Wi-Fi feature. No more running back to the kitchen to wait for the ice to fill up, now you can request fresh ice from your smartphone and it'll be ready when you get home. This makes it convenient for everyone, not just the one refilling the container. 

I also appreciated the effortless dispensing system. No more painstaking scooping - just push the button and a nugget of delight slides right out.

The sleek and compact design even fits easily under kitchen cabinets, making your countertop look more organized and uncluttered. And guess what? This whisper-quiet machine even powers on automatically when the ice is running low, ensuring you always have a fresh supply. 

However, there are areas that could be improved. The cleanup process could be more simplistic. I found myself relocating the machine and properly draining it to get a thorough clean. Some users also expressed frustration with the small capacity of the machine, pointing out that it doesn't cater to a bigger crowd. 

The build sturdiness also seemed to be lacking, even after a short period of use. But don’t forget, for a technology enthusiast like me, the voice-control software compatible with both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant was a great addition. 

Finally, note that this model cannot be replaced in future, leaving owners of this discontinued model helpless. 

Overall, I would say it's worth a try, but there are areas where GE could make some improvements. So, while you're contemplating, why not check out the Opal Nugget Ice Maker 2.0? After all, they say 'the more you give, the more you get! '

Even with the powerful operation, this ice maker makes me feel confident about its reversible door with articulating hinges that can be easily adjusted to swing left or right. It's like it was made with convenience in mind! But the noise. . well, that's not something I can overlook. It's quite loud, especially during peak ice production. 

As for installation, it's a breeze! The built-in or freestanding capabilities made it a piece of cake to suit the needs of my kitchen. And the customizable icemaker panels? A great touch to match the look of my existing appliances. 

However, this ice maker isn't without its cons. The price tag is steep, not just for the ice maker itself, but also for added features and necessary accessories. It may even be considered too high for budget-conscious consumers. 

Another thing I noticed about the ice maker is the durability. It seems to be lacking in this department. And despite its sleek design, the unit feels not so solid and sturdy. 

So, to sum it up, the Ge Nugget Ice Maker is a top-of-the-line machine that excels in making chewy, nugget-style ice, has a user-friendly interface and a smart filtration system that can reduce impurities. But it's not without its trade-offs, like its steep price and questionable durability. All in all, if you're planning to go all out for your nugget ice fix at home or for entertaining, you may find it worth the investment.

Cleaning is essential in maintaining the appliance's functionality and prolonging its lifespan.
