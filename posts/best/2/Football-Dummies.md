The foam interior and reinforced vinyl shell not only protect the users from injury but also increase the product's overall lifespan by making it more resistant to wear and tear. 

One area where the product could use some improvement, however, is the weight. As athletes, we rely on weighted objects to help us improve our strength and endurance.

Overall, my experience with the Goalrilla Football Tackling Dummy has been positive.
