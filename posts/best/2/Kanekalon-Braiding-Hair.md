### [Janet Collection Noir 6x Afro Twist Braid (Marley Style) - Kanekalon Braiding Hair](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Kanekalon+Braiding+Hair?utm\_term=janet-collection-noir-6x-afro-twist-braid-marley-style-kanekalon-braiding-hair)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Kanekalon+Braiding+Hair?utm_term=janet-collection-noir-6x-afro-twist-braid-marley-style-kanekalon-braiding-hair"><img alt="janet-collection-kanekalon-braids-noir-6x-afro-twist-braid-marley-style-oet1b-burg-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/janet-collection-kanekalon-braids-noir-6x-afro-twist-braid-marley-style-oet1b-burg-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Incorporating the Janet Collection Kanekalon Braids Noir 6X into my daily hair routine has been a delightful experience. With a length of 18 inches folded and 36 inches unfolded, it's perfect for achieving my desired volume in my cropped twists. The marley style braid adds a touch of elegance and uniqueness, setting it apart from regular braiding hair. 

One of the best features I've found with this braid is the ease and speed of crochet styling. It's a breeze to attach the braid to my hair, and the latch hook system ensures a secure and tight fit. The flexibility of the Kanekalon fibers makes it perfect for creating intricate designs and adding subtle movement to my hairstyle. 

However, it's also important to note that the material may not last as long as natural hair or some higher-end synthetic braids. I've noticed that after a few months, the braid starts to fray and look less polished, which may require more frequent replacements to maintain the desired appearance. Nonetheless, for the price point, it's still a great option for those who want to experiment with different hair styles without making a significant investment.

## Buyer's Guide

Kanekalon braiding hair has become increasingly popular among women who want to change their hairstyle or enhance their appearance. It's made from a special type of synthetic fiber that can easily blend with natural hair, providing a seamless look. To help you make the best choice when buying Kanekalon braiding hair, here are some important features, considerations, and general advice. 


### Types of Kanekalon Braiding Hair

There are two main types of Kanekalon braiding hair: synthetic and heat-friendly. Synthetic braiding hair is generally more affordable and can be used in various hairstyles such as braids, twists, and updos. Heat-friendly Kanekalon braiding hair, on the other hand, is designed to withstand heat from styling tools without melting or damaging. This type is ideal for individuals who want to straighten or curl their braiding hair, making it suitable for a wider range of hairstyles.

It's essential to consider the length and texture of your natural hair when selecting the Kanekalon braiding hair, to ensure a natural appearance and easy blending. 


### Maintenance and Care

Proper maintenance and care are crucial for maintaining the quality and lifespan of your Kanekalon braiding hair. Regularly wash your hair with a gentle shampoo and conditioner to keep it moisturized and tangle-free. Make sure to dry your hair gently after washing, using a wide-tooth comb to detangle it. Store your Kanekalon braiding hair in a dry and cool place when not in use, and avoid exposing it to direct sunlight or harsh chemicals, as they can damage the fibers.
