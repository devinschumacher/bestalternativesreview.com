The Ninja SS351 Foodi Power Blender & Processor System has been a game-changer in my kitchen. I've been using it for a few months now, and I must say it's one of the best blenders I've used in the mid-tier range. One of the things I love about it is its sleek and modern design. The lid with the locking mechanism and the spout is very functional, although it can sometimes be a bit confusing to tell if the spout is locked down correctly. 

One of the standout features of this blender is its powerful performance. I use it to blend frozen fruit and ice with ease, something I didn't find in other blenders I've used in the past. The built-in twist tamper makes it simple to push ingredients down towards the high-speed blades, ensuring I get even and thick results. The smartTORQUE technology also allows for variable speed control, which is perfect for my needs. 

However, this blender isn't flawless. I've encountered some issues with the lid and the suction cups breaking within a short period of time. I initially faced a situation where a kitchen full of smoke occurred, and my main concern has been the suction cups being difficult to release. 

When it comes to cleaning, the blender is quite easy to clean as it features dishwasher-safe parts, which saves me a lot of time and effort. The Hybrid Edge blades make for a complete and thorough chopping, which is excellent for recipes like onions and peppers. The Nutrient Extraction Cup with a spout lid is also a useful addition when I need to make extractions like protein shakes. 

In conclusion, the Ninja SS351 Foodi Power Blender & Processor System is a powerful, sleek, and easy-to-clean blender in the mid-tier range. Its versatility in functions and its performance when handling frozen fruit and ice stand out, but I do urge caution when dealing with the lid and suction cups, as they may break within a short period of time.

However, the noise level does tend to interrupt my daily routine, especially when I'm blending at a higher speed. I also found that cleaning the blades and pitcher could be a bit tricky, though I'm sure some users can find their own hacks for the easiest cleaning experience. 

Overall, I'd say the Ninja TWISTi High-Speed Blender DUO is a powerful, easy-to-use blender that excels at creating smooth textures out of ingredients. With its included preset Auto-iQ programs, blending has never been easier and more versatile.
