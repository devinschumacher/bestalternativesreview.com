### [Navy Button Front Midi Shirt Dress by Nina Leonard at Nordstrom Rack](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Navy+Shirt+Dress?utm\_term=navy-button-front-midi-shirt-dress-by-nina-leonard-at-nordstrom-rack)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Navy+Shirt+Dress?utm_term=navy-button-front-midi-shirt-dress-by-nina-leonard-at-nordstrom-rack"><img alt="nina-leonard-button-front-midi-shirt-dress-navy-at-nordstrom-rack-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/nina-leonard-button-front-midi-shirt-dress-navy-at-nordstrom-rack-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The spread collar and V-neck create a sophisticated look, while the sleeveless design keeps it light and airy. The button front closure adds a classic touch, and the self-tie waist allows for a custom fit. 

One feature that stood out to me is the midi length, which is perfect for transitioning from day to night. The approximate 51" length hits right above the knee, making it both stylish and comfortable. However, the weight of the fabric felt a bit heavy for summer, and I found that the collar didn't hang evenly. 

As for the reviews, most users love the dress's color and comfort. They appreciate the gold buttons and how the length looks with the style of the dress. Some users had issues with the fit, with the bust area being larger than expected. A few users also mentioned the presence of too many slits, which led them to return the dress. 

Overall, this Nina Leonard Button Front Midi Shirt Dress is a lovely option for those looking for a versatile and stylish midi shirt dress. It has its pros, like the color and V-neck, but also some cons, like the fit and weight of the fabric. 


### [Pari Passu Navy Shirtdress for Women (Size 18)](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Navy+Shirt+Dress?utm\_term=pari-passu-navy-shirtdress-for-women-size-18)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Navy+Shirt+Dress?utm_term=pari-passu-navy-shirtdress-for-women-size-18"><img alt="pari-passu-womens-poplin-shirtdress-navy-size-19" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/pari-passu-womens-poplin-shirtdress-navy-size-19/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I had the chance to try on the Pari Passu Women's Poplin Shirtdress in Navy and found it to be a delightful addition to my wardrobe. The fabric felt light and comfortable, making it perfect for both casual and professional occasions. The shirtdress came in a beautiful navy color, which looked stunning with a black pump. 

One feature that stood out to me was the full skirt, which gave the dress a chic and elegant touch. The buttons down the front and the side seam pockets were practical and added a touch of sophistication to the design. The self-sash and cuffed sleeves added an extra layer of style, making this dress an essential piece for my closet. 

One downside I noticed was the absence of loops to keep the belt in place, but I was able to easily overcome this by adding my own. Overall, I was thrilled with this dress and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a versatile and stylish shirtdress. 


### [Navy Knee-Length Belted Shirtdress from Boden](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Navy+Shirt+Dress?utm\_term=navy-knee-length-belted-shirtdress-from-boden)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Navy+Shirt+Dress?utm_term=navy-knee-length-belted-shirtdress-from-boden"><img alt="boden-julia-long-sleeve-belted-shirtdress-in-navy-at-nordstrom-size-7" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/boden-julia-long-sleeve-belted-shirtdress-in-navy-at-nordstrom-size-7/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried on the Boden Julia Long Sleeve Belted Shirtdress in Navy, and I must say, it made quite an impression. This versatile shirt dress proved to be the perfect transitional piece for my wardrobe, and its full-length sleeves and belt gave it a structured look without sacrificing comfort. 

One of the highlights of this dress was its unique collar design. It was a round band collar that could be either fully buttoned or left open, giving it a distinct and chic finish. The teal color paired with the black floral print was also a delightful touch, adding a touch of elegance without being too formal. 

While there were aspects of the design that I appreciated, there were also a few areas where the dress fell short. One of the main issues I encountered was the sizing. I found that the waist seam was about two inches too high, causing the belt to sit below where it should and partially blocking the pockets. This issue only became more apparent as I tried using different belts to elevate the dress's look. 

Additionally, some users noted that the sleeves were slightly too long, which could be a bit of a nuisance for those with long arms like myself. The cuffs also seemed to be an issue as they didn't quite fit well with the round collar, resulting in a less-than-ideal look. 

Despite these minor setbacks, I found that the dress was well-made and of good quality. The knit fabric had a nice weight that made it suitable for the autumn season, and the midi length was perfect for my 5'10'' height. 

In conclusion, the Boden Julia Long Sleeve Belted Shirtdress in Navy offers a classic and transitional look that can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. However, the high waist seam, sleeves length, and cuff issues might result in some trial and error when finding the perfect belt to pair with it. With the right adjustments, this dress could become a wardrobe staple for those seeking a versatile and elegant transitional piece.

When looking for a navy shirt dress, it is essential to consider several factors to ensure that you find the right one for your needs. In this buyer's guide, we will discuss important features, considerations, and general advice to help you make an informed decision. 


### Material

The material is a crucial aspect of a navy shirt dress, as it determines the dress's comfort, durability, and breathability.

A navy shirt dress should fit comfortably without being too tight or too loose. Look for a dress with adjustable straps, a waistband, and a hemline that allows for easy movement. Consider your body shape and choose a dress with a flattering cut and length. If you're unsure about the sizing, consider purchasing a dress from a brand that offers easy returns or exchanges. 


### Design

Opt for a simple, timeless design that can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. Look for details like buttons or pockets that add interest to the dress.
