### [SARO Lifestyle Luxurious Mongolian Wool Fur Pouf Ottoman](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Fur+Ottoman?utm\_term=saro-lifestyle-luxurious-mongolian-wool-fur-pouf-ottoman)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Fur+Ottoman?utm_term=saro-lifestyle-luxurious-mongolian-wool-fur-pouf-ottoman"><img alt="saro-lifestyle-real-mongolian-100-wool-lamb-fur-pouf-ottoman-18-x-18-fog-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/saro-lifestyle-real-mongolian-100-wool-lamb-fur-pouf-ottoman-18-x-18-fog-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently added the SARO LIFESTYLE Real Mongolian 100% Wool Lamb Fur Pouf Ottoman to my living space, and it's been a breath of fresh air. The rich, luxurious texture of the lamb fur adds a touch of elegance that cannot be replicated by synthetic materials. The pouf comes in a lovely fog color that blends effortlessly with my existing decor, and the overall size of 18 inches makes it the perfect addition for any space. 

One of the most notable aspects of this ottoman is its sturdiness. I've tried a few similar products in the past, but they would often roll around or shift when I tried to use them as a footrest. Not this one. The SARO LIFESTYLE Mongolian Wool Lamb Fur Pouf Ottoman is a true work of art, both in design and comfort. It's like having your very own fluffy cloud right in your living room. 

While I initially found the price a bit steep for a pouf, the quality of materials and craftsmanship more than make up for it. The beanbag pellet filler adds a nice touch of substance, making it both comfortable to sit on and sturdy for use as an occasional footrest. The fur texture does have a tendency to stick to your socks, so be prepared for that. 

Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase. The SARO LIFESTYLE Real Mongolian 100% Wool Lamb Fur Pouf Ottoman has become a favorite in my home, and I can't imagine life without it. It adds a touch of luxury and charm that's simply unmatched by other poufs on the market.

One of the standout features of this ottoman is its multi-functionality. It can be used as an ottoman foot rest, a cozy bean bag chair, or even an extra seating option. However, I did notice that the zipper on the cover is a bit smaller than I would have liked, making it a bit difficult to stuff in larger fillers. 

Another great aspect of this fur pouf ottoman is its large round opening, which accommodates various fillers and makes it easy to clean. The vacuumed and shrink-packed design ensures a seamless unpacking experience. Despite being packed, the fur pouf ottoman still manages to maintain its soft, fluffy texture.

### What type of fur materials are available for Ottomans?

The variety of fur options for Ottomans is quite extensive. They are available in a plethora of animal skins, including sheepskin, mink, beaver, and even reindeer. These animal skins come in different colors and textures, providing a wide selection to cater to personal preferences or complement existing d√©cor themes in your home.

If animal skins are not your preference, there are also synthetic leather options available. These materials mimic the look and feel of genuine animal skins without the associated costs or ethical implications. The choice of material ultimately depends on personal preference, budget, and the desired aesthetic outcome for your interior design.


### How can I choose the right Fur Ottoman size?

Selecting the appropriate size for your Fur Ottoman is a crucial step to ensure that it's both functional and aesthetically pleasing in the intended space. Measure the area where you plan to place your Fur Ottoman, taking care to account for space needed for other furniture, doors, or walkways. This will help guide you in selecting the right size that balances comfort and accessibility.

Consider choosing a size slightly smaller than initially measured to make it easier to move if needed. If acquiring multiple Ottomans for varied seating areas, opting for ottomans with the same design can create a cohesive and unified look throughout your living space.
