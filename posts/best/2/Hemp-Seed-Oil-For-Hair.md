To my delight, the product truly delivers on its claims to nourish and moisturize. I could feel the difference right away - my hair felt softer and silkier. The deep moisturizing properties helped to repair the damage that my hair had suffered. 

However, it's not all rosy. While the product does work wonders for my hair, I've found that the instructions can be a bit unclear, and I had to experiment a bit to find the perfect amount to use. Overall, I'd definitely recommend giving this hemp seed leave in conditioner a try, especially if you're looking for a product that leaves your hair looking and feeling healthy and strong.

### [Acure Essentials Hemp Seed Oil Boost for Hair](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Hemp+Seed+Oil+For+Hair?utm\_term=acure-essentials-hemp-seed-oil-boost-for-hair)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Hemp+Seed+Oil+For+Hair?utm_term=acure-essentials-hemp-seed-oil-boost-for-hair"><img alt="acure-the-essentials-hemp-seed-oil-1-fl-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/acure-the-essentials-hemp-seed-oil-1-fl-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

In the product's claims, it's mentioned that it's infused with hemp seed oil and formulated with omega 6 to reduce the appearance of wrinkles, giving a youthful look. I must admit, I was skeptical at first, but after using it for a week, I noticed that my skin began to look dewy and smooth. It felt as if my skin had finally found its natural balance, and I attributed this to the nourishing properties of the hemp seed oil.

Even when I used slightly more than necessary, it never left behind a greasy residue, and I appreciated the fact that it was gentle enough for my sensitive skin. 

The only drawback was the scent. While it's true that many customers enjoyed the strong hemp-based aroma, I found it to be quite intense and somewhat overpowering. I began to worry if others in my household might find it unpleasant, so I decided to only use this product in the evenings when I was alone. 

Overall, I found the Acure Hemp Seed Oil to be an effective skin care product that provided much-needed moisture and maintained a healthy balance. Although the scent was quite strong and may not be to everyone's liking, it was a small price to pay for the overall results and benefits I experienced.

For a pre-shampoo treatment, apply the oil onto your hair at least 30 minutes before washing it. This will give the oil ample time to penetrate and nourish the hair shaft. If you prefer to use it after shampooing, apply the oil while your hair is still damp and style it as usual. For mixing with your conditioner, simply add a few drops of hemp seed oil to your favorite conditioner and work it through your hair.
