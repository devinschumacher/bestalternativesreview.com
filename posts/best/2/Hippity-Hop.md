### [Hippity Hop Confetti Space Hopper for Kids Ages 3-6](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Hippity+Hop?utm\_term=hippity-hop-confetti-space-hopper-for-kids-ages-3-6)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Hippity+Hop?utm_term=hippity-hop-confetti-space-hopper-for-kids-ages-3-6"><img alt="oriental-trading-company-bintiva-confetti-hippitty-hop-45-cm-18-inch-diameter-including-free-foot-pu-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/oriental-trading-company-bintiva-confetti-hippitty-hop-45-cm-18-inch-diameter-including-free-foot-pu-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Last week, my little one asked me to show her a fun toy that would help her become more energetic and healthy. I picked out the Oriental Trading Company's Bintiva Confetti Hippitty Hop, which is designed for children 3 to 6 years old. Little did we know that we discovered the perfect space hopper for enhancing our child's balance, coordination, and strength. 

The Hop Ball Bo Purple, as my child likes to call it, was lightweight, easy to maneuver, and it even came with a free pump. It made the bouncing a more entertaining experience with its confetti design, which captured her imagination, and she hopped all day! The material was safe and eco-friendly, which made me comfortable. 

While she had a blast hopping around the playroom, she also learned a lot of valuable lessons that I didn't anticipate. The bouncing improved her balance, core strength, and even her vestibular orientation. As a parent, it was so rewarding to see the joy on her face while she played with her new toy, all the while unknowingly boosting her health. 

One minor negative to mention is that the Hop Ball Bo Purple might not be sturdy enough for children to sit on it without it tipping over, but that issue didn't seem to bother my child too much. Overall, it's a great outdoor or indoor toy to stimulate children's physical activity and provide them with hours of enjoyment. So if you're in the market for a fun and engaging hopper for your little one, Hippitty Hop is definitely the way to go! 


### [Superhero Hippity Hopper Toy](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Hippity+Hop?utm\_term=superhero-hippity-hopper-toy)

I recently stumbled upon the Ddi Superhero Hippity Hoppers, and I must say, they've become a staple in my household. These little superheroes dole out hours of entertainment for kids as young as three, preventing boredom even during our rainy days. The foam heads and arms give kids the ability to hop, flip, and even invent their own tricks! 

What stood out to me the most was how the Hippity Hoppers featured assorted colors and designs. It made it even more exciting for my kids to collect them all. The soft plastic base also made them easy to handle and added safety to the toy. However, I did notice that the foam heads have a tendency to peel, but it hasn't stopped my little superheroes from having fun. 

The 3 3/4 inch tall Hippity Hoppers make them an ideal size for small hands. They also make a fun addition to superhero-themed parties as party favors, keeping the kids entertained even after the party is over. Despite the minor issue with the foam heads, these Hippity Hoppers have definitely been a win in our household.

I recently had the pleasure of using Hippity Hop's Wildflowers fabric, and let me tell you, it has made quite the impression. This vibrant and colorful designer fabric not only adds a burst of energy to any quilt project, but it's also surprisingly soft and comfortable to the touch. 

One thing that stood out to me was the high-quality cotton used in the fabric itself. The texture was so smooth that it felt like a dream, making it a joy to work with. The fabric also held up well during various washing cycles, which is a plus if you're a frequent quilter like myself. 

However, no product is without its minor drawbacks, and this one was no exception. The overall design of the print was a bit overwhelming compared to some others I've used. While it does add excitement to a quilt project, it may not be the best choice for those looking for something more understated. 

Despite this minor flaw, I have to say that I am incredibly satisfied with the Hippity Hop Wildflowers fabric. Its bright colors and high-quality cotton have undoubtedly earned a spot in my quilting projects, and I'm sure it will do the same for you too.
