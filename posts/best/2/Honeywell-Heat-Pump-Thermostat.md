The package contains everything you need - from the UWP Mounting System to an Installation Guide, making it a breeze to get started. 

Another highlight is the optional dual fuel, which gives you the versatility to operate off two different fuels. This can be particularly useful if you're in a location where different types of fuel are used depending on the season, thus helping to optimize your energy usage. 

Moreover, the optional wired indoor/outdoor sensors provide additional information and control over the temperature settings in your home. These sensors can provide real-time weather data and help make more informed decisions about your heating and cooling needs. 

However, there are a few areas where this thermostat could be improved. The user interface could be more intuitive and user-friendly. It's a little too complicated to fumble around with every day, especially when you're in a hurry. And while the display is attractive, it could be made bigger for easier viewing. 

Customer service is also something that Honeywell needs to work on. A few users have reported issues with malfunctioning thermostats and had trouble getting replacements from the company, even if they were within the warranty period. 

Overall, the Honeywell Pro TH6220U2000 T6 Programmable Thermostat is a reliable and versatile solution for your heat pump system. While it might take a bit of time to get used to the user interface, once you do, it's a piece of cake. Though customer service could be better, the pros definitely outweigh the cons.

## FAQ


### What is a heat pump thermostat?

A heat pump thermostat is a special type of thermostat designed to work with heat pump systems. It controls the heating and cooling functions of the heat pump to provide comfortable temperatures in your home. These thermostats are typically programmable, allowing you to set different temperatures for different times of the day. 

Heat pump thermostats often come with built-in features like energy management, zone control, and compatibility with smart home devices. They help improve the efficiency of your heating and cooling system, leading to lower energy bills and a greener lifestyle. The Honeywell brand is well-known for producing high-quality and reliable heat pump thermostats. 


### Which Honeywell heat pump thermostat models should I consider?

In the Honeywell lineup, consider the following models: RTH9510B1 and RTH9560B1. Both models offer programming capabilities, energy management options, and compatibility with Honeywell smart thermostat features. They are also compatible with Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit, and Google Home, allowing you to control your heat pump system remotely using voice commands or smartphone apps. 

The RTH9510B1 is an analog thermostat, while the RTH9560B1 is a digital one. The analog model has a user-friendly interface, whereas the digital model offers more advanced features.

### What is the difference between an analog and a digital heat pump thermostat?

Analog and digital heat pump thermostats differ in terms of their user interface and features. An analog thermostat typically features a mechanical dial with temperature settings and a simple button to input the setpoint. On the other hand, digital thermostats use an electronic display and a more advanced interface for setting temperatures and preferences. 

Digital thermostats often have more features, such as displaying the outdoor temperature, adjusting temperature setpoints in different time slots, and offering smart compatibility. They can also be easier to read and operate compared to their analog counterparts. While both types of thermostats work well, the choice between them depends on your personal preferences and specific needs.

If you prefer to keep your thermostat wired, Honeywell also offers non-WiFi-enabled digital models like the RTH6580U and RTH6540U. These thermostats offer similar programming and smart compatibility as their WiFi-enabled counterparts, but they do not support remote access and control via WiFi or smartphone apps.

These compatibility options let you create bespoke smart home setups and enjoy hands-free control over your Honeywell heat pump thermostat. Honeywell continues to develop new partnerships and expand their product portfolio to accommodate various smart home technologies.
