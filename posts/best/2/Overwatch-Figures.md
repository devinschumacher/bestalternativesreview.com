### [Overwatch Blizzard Frosted Zarya Figure](https://serp.ly/amazon/Overwatch+Figures?utm\_term=overwatch-blizzard-frosted-zarya-figure)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Overwatch+Figures?utm_term=overwatch-blizzard-frosted-zarya-figure"><img alt="overwatch-winter-wonderland-frosted-zarya-figure-blizzard-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/overwatch-winter-wonderland-frosted-zarya-figure-blizzard-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently acquired the Frosted Zarya Figure from Blizzard, and it has become an essential addition to my collection of Overwatch figurines. The moment I set eyes on it, I was captivated by the intricate details and the captivating winter theme. The figure is meticulously crafted, capturing every nook and cranny of Zarya's gear and armor. 

One of the most impressive features of this figurine is the Frosty Frost effect, which gives Zarya an icy, glittering makeover. It really brings the holiday spirit to life and adds a touch of magic to my display case. However, I noticed that the figure's base was not as sturdy as I would have liked. It wobbles slightly when I knock into it, which can be a bit annoying at times. 

Despite this minor issue, I have overall been quite pleased with the Frosted Zarya Figure. Its stunning design and attention to detail make it a standout addition to any Overwatch figure collection. Plus, the seller's commitment to thorough inspection and packing has ensured that it arrived in perfect condition and ready to take its place among my other beloved figurines. 


### [Overwatch: Hanzo and Genji Dual Figure Pack](https://serp.ly/amazon/Overwatch+Figures?utm\_term=overwatch-hanzo-and-genji-dual-figure-pack)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Overwatch+Figures?utm_term=overwatch-hanzo-and-genji-dual-figure-pack"><img alt="overwatch-ultimates-hanzo-and-genji-dual-pack-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/overwatch-ultimates-hanzo-and-genji-dual-pack-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Overwatch Ultimates bring the legendary Hanzo and Genji to life in this sleek dual-pack figure. With 6-inch scale figures, players can build their team straight out of the game, complete with accessories and poses reminiscent of their in-game counterparts. It comes with multiple points of articulation, allowing for endless configurations in displays or action play. 

However, Hanzo's lackluster arm articulation can sometimes limit posing capabilities, and Genji's minimalistic paint scheme may leave collectors wanting more detail. Nevertheless, for Overwatch fans looking to expand their collection, the Genji and Hanzo Dual Pack is a fantastic addition, offering top-notch performance at an affordable price point. 


### [Pop Up Parade Tracer Overwatch 2 Figure](https://serp.ly/amazon/Overwatch+Figures?utm\_term=pop-up-parade-tracer-overwatch-2-figure)

As someone who has been a fan of Overwatch for years, the release of Tracer by Good Smile Company's Pop Up Parade line was like finding the missing piece to my collection. Her vibrant personality reflects well in the intricate details of this figure, and although her stand is a bit basic, the PVC material gives her a sturdy foundation. 

One of the things I appreciate most about this Tracer figure is her expressive face, which captures her sparkling nature perfectly. The material used also ensures her durability, making her perfect for displaying on my desk without worrying about any damage. However, the base is somewhat plain, so I would have liked a more elaborate design to complement her character. 

In conclusion, this Pop Up Parade Tracer figure is a fantastic addition to any Overwatch fan's collection. With its intricate details, vibrant colors, and sturdy build, she is sure to stand out as a focal point on my desk. As a lover of unique and high-quality pop culture figures, I highly recommend this one for anyone looking to expand their collection.

### What are Overwatch Figures?

Overwatch Figures refer to collectible action figures based on characters from the game Overwatch, developed by Blizzard Entertainment. These figures showcase the unique designs, weapons, and personalities of each Overwatch hero in intricate detail, making them a popular choice among collectors and fans of the game. 

These figures are typically produced by licensed manufacturers such as Blizzard Entertainment themselves or other well-known figures and collectibles manufacturers like McFarlane Toys, Hot Toys, or Funko. They often include features like multiple points of articulation, interchangeable parts (such as hands or weapons), and detailed accessories. 


### Where can I find Overwatch Figures?

Overwatch Figures can be found at various retailers, both online and in physical stores. Some popular websites include Amazon, eBay, and various collectibles specialty stores like Entertainment Earth or Big Bad Toy Store. Brick and mortar retailers like Target, Walmart, or specialty gaming stores may carry some Overwatch Figures as well. 

It is essential to shop from reputable sources to ensure authenticity and condition. Be sure to compare prices across different platforms and read customer reviews before making a purchase. Check if the figures you are interested in are available for pre-order if they have not been released yet. Additionally, keep an eye on limited edition or exclusive releases that may not be available at every retailer.

### How much do Overwatch Figures cost?

The cost of Overwatch Figures can vary significantly depending on factors such as size, complexity, scarcity, and exclusivity. Generally, prices range from around $15 for smaller, more basic figures to $100 or more for larger, highly detailed premium figures with multiple accessories. Exclusive Limited Edition releases can cost over $200 or even more, especially if they are numbered, autographed, or come with additional perks like a display base or art card. 

It is essential to set a budget before purchasing an Overwatch Figure to avoid spending beyond your means. Keep in mind that the prices of collectibles can fluctuate over time, especially for popular or rare items. Comparing prices from different retailers can help you secure the best deal possible. 


### Are Overwatch Figures suitable for kids?

Most Overwatch Figures are designed with a broad age range in mind, including children. However, it is crucial to consider the specific figures and their recommended age group before purchasing for a child. Some figures may have small accessories or intricate details that might present a choking hazard for younger children. Manufacturers generally provide age recommendations on the packaging or product information, so be sure to check that as well. 

Additionally, as with any toy, adult supervision is recommended when handling or playing with Overwatch Figures, especially when it comes to small parts or when figures with posable articulation are involved. This helps ensure the safety of children while they enjoy their new collectibles. Remember to store the figures out of reach of small children when not in use.

### How do I display my Overwatch Figures?

Displaying your Overwatch Figures can be an enjoyable aspect of collecting them. There are several options available to showcase your figures, including: a dedicated figure display case, action figure stands, or even custom-built dioramas that match the theme of your favorite Overwatch characters. These displays can help protect your figures from dust and damage, and add an aesthetically pleasing touch to your space. 

Another excellent way to display your figures is to group them by teams, such as the heroes' roles (tank, damage, support), release dates, or your personal collection preferences. This not only helps keep your collection organized but also encourages discussion and admiration among fellow Overwatch fans and collectors. 


### How do I clean my Overwatch Figures?

Cleaning your Overwatch Figures is necessary to keep them looking pristine and avoid damaging the paint or details. Some general guidelines for cleaning action figures include using a soft-bristled toothbrush, microfiber cloth, or a dedicated figure cleaning kit. Soft, colorless soaps or gently-scented ones with water can also be used to wash your figures, ensuring that no residue is left behind. 

Avoid using water or harsh cleaning solutions on electronic components or any part of the figures that are not meant to get wet. Be gentle while cleaning, and never use a toothpick or other sharp objects to remove dust or debris from small crevices, as this can scratch the surface of the figure. Properly air-drying your figures to avoid moisture build-up is also essential after cleaning.
