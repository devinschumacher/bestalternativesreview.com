The Blend Knob is perfect for adjusting the balance between the two, making it super versatile for any playing style. I especially love the slim and fast feel of the neck, which makes playing more comfortable and effortless. 

However, I did notice the high E string is a bit more fragile than the rest, but that's a small trade-off for all the versatility this guitar offers. Overall, it's a great guitar that delivers on its promise, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a versatile and high-quality instrument.

The built-in chorus effect was a nice touch, adding a layer of depth to my guitar playing. 

However, there were a couple of drawbacks to using this bundle. While the amp itself is quite versatile, the cable was a bit of a letdown. It didn't seem as sturdy as I would have liked, which made me a bit concerned about its longevity. Additionally, I found that the volume level wasn't as high as I would have preferred for larger performances or gigs. 

Overall, the Fender Acoustasonic 15 Combo Cable Bundle is a great choice for musicians looking for a simple and convenient way to amplify their acoustic guitar and microphone setup.

I've been using the Fender American Acoustasonic Strat Cocobolo for a few weeks now, and it has been quite an experience. This state-of-the-art guitar has a unique blend of sounds that I haven't encountered before. The hum-free Fender electric tone is impressive, and I've enjoyed experimenting with the different sounds. 

The mahogany Stratocaster neck with the ebony fingerboard provides a familiar playing feel, while the warm tones add depth to my music. The Stringed Instrument Resonance System (SIRS) and inlaid top are both clever innovations that add to the overall experience. 

The guitar was crafted in Corona, California, where Fender's iconic electric instruments are made, which shows a high level of attention to detail and quality. The physical condition of the guitar is great, with minimal wear, and the electronics work perfectly.

What struck me the most about this amp was its astounding stereo sound. The tri-amps within it, including an 8 low-frequency driver, high-frequency tweeter, and side-radiating 6 speaker, work in harmony to transport you into a whole new world of shimmering, immersive audio. The Stereo Field Expansion technology truly makes a difference, creating a three-dimensional sound experience that is simply breathtaking.

My experience was enhanced by its lightweight design, allowing me to effortlessly transport it wherever I needed to perform. 

One of the standout features of this amp is its two-channel setup, one for an instrument input and another for a microphone input, both with adjustable volume controls. This not only made it perfect for singers like myself but also proved to be an invaluable tool during rehearsals and small performances. 

The built-in chorus effect on the instrument channel added depth and richness to my playing style, making my practice sessions and performances more enjoyable. The ability to plug in headphones was another convenient feature that allowed me to practice silently at any time. 

Although I highly recommend the Fender Acoustasonic 15 Acoustic Combo for its exceptional sound quality and wide range of features, some users may find that the power output of 15 watts might not be sufficient for louder, larger performances.

This allows you to create a wide range of sounds, from warm acoustic ballads to powerful electric solos, without even having to switch guitars. 

However, there are a couple of downsides to this guitar. Firstly, while it's lightweight, the neck can feel a little thin for some users, especially if they're used to a slightly bulkier acoustic guitar. Secondly, the premium gig bag that comes with the guitar is functional, but it's not the most stylish option out there. 

Overall, the Fender American Acoustasonic Stratocaster natural has been a fantastic addition to my collection. Its lightweight design, comfortable playability, and wide range of tones make it a versatile and enjoyable instrument for any guitarist. Despite a few minor drawbacks, the pros outweigh the cons, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this guitar to anyone looking for a high-quality, all-in-one instrument.

However, the guitar's highlight is definitely the magic switch that transforms its soundscapes in an instant. No need for multiple guitars during a live set – this one does it all! While I did find the pickup wire thickness to affect the saddle's depth, a simple adjustment gave me the perfect setup. 

The Shadow Burst finish on the Acoustasonic Player looked as striking as the guitar sounds. The slimline case that came with it felt tailored to fit the guitar like a glove, making it even easier to whip this beauty out at a gig or session.
