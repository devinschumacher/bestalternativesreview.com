Meet Evnroll's ER2vB MidBlade Putter, expertly crafted by putting enthusiast Guerin Rife. This innovative design boasts a mill pattern that ensures consistent performance across the entire face for increased accuracy and diminished dispersion. 

A standout feature is the variety of head weights and hosel options, tailored to each club length, providing the perfect balance for every golfer. The mid slant hosel neck contributes to better face rotation without promoting pull or push. The collar-type hosel fits effortlessly over the shaft with a forward slanting hosel arm, resulting in a one-shaft offset. With Sweet Face Technology, off-centre hits receive more energy transfer, enhancing distance control and consistency. 

The face milling imparts progressively, ensuring the ball returns to the sweet spot, providing more consistent rolls. The hand-feel is further improved by the placement of a 70-gram steel rod along the grip, half an inch below the shaft, enabling golfers to instinctively align the face for a square impact. The V Series version offers expanded choices for hosel options. This high-quality putter comes complete with a black armour finish, TourTac grip, and matching headcover, making it a standout choice for golfers seeking top-notch performance.

One of the standout features for me was the CNC milling process used to create this putter. The precision in the manufacturing process is evident in the smooth, sleek design and the weight distribution. The silver satin finish adds an elegant touch to the overall aesthetic. 

However, I did find the balance of the putter to be slightly off, with a noticeable 22-degree toe-down bias. This affected my putting arc and resulted in a few misaligned shots.

I have noticed that it offers a smooth swing and feels perfectly balanced, thanks to the swing weight being balanced by the length. The putter's shaft is a FST stepless with a. 370-inch tip, giving it an impressive feel off the face.

It's slightly softer than my Scotty, providing a unique feel that I've grown to appreciate. I highly recommend giving this putter a try – it might just be the key to sinking more putts and improving your overall game.
