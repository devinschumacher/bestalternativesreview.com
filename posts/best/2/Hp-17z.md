The 17.3" HD+ touchscreen display is perfect for watching videos or working on design projects, with its BrightView, 250 nits, and 60% NTSC tech specs making for an immersive viewing experience. 

However, I have noticed a few limitations to the laptop's upgradability, which may be a concern for those who prefer to customize their devices. Some users have also mentioned issues with the keyboard layout and lack of USB ports. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, the HP Newest 17T laptop has proven to be a reliable and efficient addition to my daily routine. Its compatibility with Windows 11, Android apps, and the HP True Vision 720p HD camera make it a versatile choice for both personal and professional use.

I recently had the opportunity to use the HP 17-cn0003, and it left quite an impression on me. The laptop comes equipped with an Intel Core i3-1125G4 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD, making it a perfect choice for my daily computing needs. 

One of the standout features of this device is its impressive 17.3-inch display. The large screen size made it effortless for me to multitask and switch between different applications without any hassle. The visuals were clear and vibrant, providing a pleasant viewing experience. 

The laptop's lift-hinge design and enlarged click pad also deserved recognition. The lift-hinge design contributed significantly to my comfort while typing, and the click pad made it easy for me to navigate through the system with just a few presses. 

However, one issue I encountered was the laptop's somewhat limited storage capacity, with only 512GB available. This made it a bit challenging for me to store all my files and documents, as I had to constantly manage what I had on the device. 

In conclusion, the HP 17-cn0003 offers a solid blend of performance and convenience.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Hp+17z?utm_term=hp-17z-series-notebook-intel-i5-8gb-memory-128gb-ssd-1tb-hdd-silver-windows-10"><img alt="hp-17-by3065st-17-3-notebook-intel-i5-8gb-memory-128gb-ssd-1tb-hard-drive-windows-10-silver-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hp-17-by3065st-17-3-notebook-intel-i5-8gb-memory-128gb-ssd-1tb-hard-drive-windows-10-silver-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The HP 17-by3065st 17.3" Notebook has been my go-to companion for the past few months. I've used it for work, entertainment, and even some light gaming. One thing that stood out to me was the sleek silver design - it fits perfectly in any setting. 

When it comes to performance, this laptop does not disappoint. The 10th Gen Intel Core i5 processor handles tasks with ease, and the 8GB RAM ensures smooth multitasking capabilities. The 1TB hard drive and 128GB SSD offer plenty of storage space for all my files and documents. 

However, there's one issue I've noticed with the keyboard. The silver lettering on the keys can be quite hard to read, especially when typing in low-light conditions. I wish the keyboard had a backlight or some sort of solution to make it more visible in different lighting scenarios. 

Overall, I'm quite pleased with this laptop. It's a reliable workhorse that gets the job done, and the sleek design is a nice added bonus. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a powerful, stylish laptop that can handle most tasks with ease. 


### [HP 17z: Fast Processing Laptop for Multitasking](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Hp+17z?utm\_term=hp-17z-fast-processing-laptop-for-multitasking)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Hp+17z?utm_term=hp-17z-fast-processing-laptop-for-multitasking"><img alt="hp-17-3-fhd-intel-core-i5-1135g7-8gb-ram-512gb-ssd-natural-silver-windows-11-home-17-by4061nr-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hp-17-3-fhd-intel-core-i5-1135g7-8gb-ram-512gb-ssd-natural-silver-windows-11-home-17-by4061nr-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've had my HP 17 for a few months now and it has served me well. The bright and crisp display is perfect for watching movies and streaming videos, while the speedy processor and ample storage make it a joy for everyday computing tasks. The integrated HD camera is a nice perk when it comes to video calls and remote meetings, and the high-resolution screen sure helps in that regard. 

There's one drawback that I've noticed though. Firstly, the backlit keyboard may seem a bit bright during the day, making it difficult to see the keys. I'd suggest turning it off when you're not using it in a darker setting. Secondly, the touchpad is not the most sensitive, meaning you'll need to tap a little harder than usual to click it. While some may find this a plus, I find it a bit bothersome. 

The laptop doesn't seem to get too noisy most of the time, but there have been times when watching videos or leaving it on for extended periods that it does get a bit warm to the touch. But all in all, I've been pretty happy with my HP 17 laptop. It's fast, sleek, and gets the job done.

The 16GB high-bandwidth RAM and 1TB PCIe NVMe M. 2 Solid State Drive have been super helpful in multi-tasking and speeding up my workflow. I also love the fact that it runs on Windows 11 Home, which has been smooth and user-friendly. The ports are so handy, especially the SuperSpeed USB Type-C 5Gbps signaling rate for faster transfers and the HDMI port for connecting to external displays. 

However, there's one con I've experienced - the battery life. It's not the best and often needs charging after a full day's work. But overall, the HP 17 laptop has been a reliable and efficient companion. So, if you're in the market for a new laptop, give this one a try!

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Hp+17z?utm_term=hp-17-3-laptop-with-intel-core-i3-8gb-ram-512gb-ssd-and-windows-11-home"><img alt="hp-17-cn2283st-17-3-laptop-intel-core-i3-1215u-8gb-memory-512gb-ssd-windows-11-home-8q3j6ua-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/hp-17-cn2283st-17-3-laptop-intel-core-i3-1215u-8gb-memory-512gb-ssd-windows-11-home-8q3j6ua-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When they say they got a laptop with an Intel Core i3 processor and an 8GB RAM, they weren't kidding. I mean, it has the power to run pretty much everything I throw at it, from intensive graphic design software to casual web browsing. And what's really impressive is that performance doesn't seem to dip even when I've got ten dozen tabs open. 

But it's not just about the raw power. The laptop's display is quite something. Being able to see more on my screen has completely changed the way I work. The screen is so large it makes me feel like I’m working on something bigger, somehow more important. 

The keyboard is another high point. It's just so comfortable to type on. Though the light gray color does make the white text blend in a bit, it didn't seem overly inconvenient to me. Plus, it's really lightweight, which I've come to cherish immensely, as I'm constantly on the go. 

Speaking of inconveniences, the battery life has never quite matched up to what's advertised. While it's not bad, it takes much more than the promised 8 hours to fully drain. But considering how good most other aspects of it are, I'm willing to overlook a slightly shorter battery life. 

The size is a bit big, which might not be everyone's cup of tea. Some people might see it as bulky, but for me, it’s just right. I've never used a small laptop anyway. But, I understand not every one prefers a bulky laptop, so it's worth putting that into consideration. 

In terms of sustainability, this laptop is top-notch too. Made with thoughtfully selected recycled materials, it's an environmentally conscious choice. The EPEAT Gold registration and ENERGY STAR rating are a testament to HP's commitment to creating products that are good for both the user and the environment. 

Overall, I'm happy with the laptop's performance and the thought that's been put into creating it. It might be a little hefty, and the battery life could use a little tweaking, but it's a great computer for the money and a worthy addition to anyone's tech lineup.
