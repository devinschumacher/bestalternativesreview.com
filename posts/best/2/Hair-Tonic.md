While I found the product to be a bit pricey considering the quantity, it certainly has the potential to become a staple for those struggling with itchy scalps and dandruff. However, those with sensitive scalps may want to reconsider, as not everyone experienced positive results. 

In conclusion, the Design Essentials Peppermint & Aloe Soothing Scalp Tonic offers both positive and negative aspects. Its soothing properties, refreshing scent, and subtle hair growth promotion are appealing, but it's crucial to evaluate its long-term effects before fully committing to its use. I would approach it with caution and reserve judgment.
