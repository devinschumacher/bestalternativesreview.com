### [Matrix Total Results High Amplify Shampoo & Conditioner Duo for Volume and Strength](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Matrix+Shampoo?utm\_term=matrix-total-results-high-amplify-shampoo-conditioner-duo-for-volume-and-strength)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Matrix+Shampoo?utm_term=matrix-total-results-high-amplify-shampoo-conditioner-duo-for-volume-and-strength"><img alt="matrix-total-results-high-amplify-shampoo-conditioner-duo-33-8-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/matrix-total-results-high-amplify-shampoo-conditioner-duo-33-8-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When I first used Matrix Total Results High Amplify Shampoo & Conditioner Duo, I was pleasantly surprised by the volume it brought to my fine hair. The scent was pleasant and the lather was rich; both these factors contributed to a better hair washing experience. However, as I continued to use the shampoo for over a month, I noticed it started to leave my hair feeling dry. I tried using a deep conditioner after shampooing but it seemed like the dryness persisted. 

I also appreciated the gentle formula of the High Amplify Shampoo, as it did not strip my hair of its natural oils, which prevented that dreaded "straw-like" hair feeling. However, I must admit that it did not leave my hair as hydrated as I would have preferred, resulting in less volume and a "squeaky clean" feeling. 

Overall, the Matrix Total Results High Amplify Shampoo & Conditioner Duo did succeed in adding volume to my fine hair in the beginning, but unfortunately, it didn't deliver the same results in the long run due to the dryness that it caused. While the shampoo was gentle, the conditioner did not match up to the same expectations.
