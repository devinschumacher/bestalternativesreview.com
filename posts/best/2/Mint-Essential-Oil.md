### [Best Peppermint Essential Oil (4oz)](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Mint+Essential+Oil?utm\_term=best-peppermint-essential-oil-4oz)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Mint+Essential+Oil?utm_term=best-peppermint-essential-oil-4oz"><img alt="peppermint-large-4oz-best-essential-oil-white-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/peppermint-large-4oz-best-essential-oil-white-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Made from a blend of peppermint and triethyl citrate oils, it offers a delightful scent while creating a calming atmosphere. The large bottle size ensures you have enough oil to last for a good amount of time, and the glass container retains the freshness of the oil. 

Although some users have mentioned the scent being too strong, others appreciate its potency. The pricing is reasonable, making it an affordable choice for those looking to experience the benefits of aromatherapy. 


### [Viva Doria Pure Peppermint Essential Oil](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Mint+Essential+Oil?utm\_term=viva-doria-pure-peppermint-essential-oil)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Mint+Essential+Oil?utm_term=viva-doria-pure-peppermint-essential-oil"><img alt="viva-doria-100-pure-northwest-peppermint-essential-oil-undiluted-food-grade-made-in-usa-4-fl-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/viva-doria-100-pure-northwest-peppermint-essential-oil-undiluted-food-grade-made-in-usa-4-fl-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using Viva Doria's Northwest Peppermint Essential Oil for a few weeks now, and it's become an essential part of my everyday routine. What's surprising is how versatile this oil is. I've been using it to flavor my homemade treats, and the strong minty flavor is a game-changer. But it's not just about the taste; it's also extremely helpful in relieving my occasional headaches. 

One thing that I noticed right away is the strong, invigorating scent. It's quite refreshing and leaves me feeling energized. And I must say, the fact that it's certified 100% natural adds to its appeal. 

Even though it's a powerful essential oil, I do need to use it with caution. When I overindulge in the minty goodness, it can leave a tingly sensation on my tongue. But hey, that's a small price to pay for a product that feels so effective. 

The great thing about this oil is that it's incredibly versatile. Whether I'm using it in the kitchen, relaxing after a long day, or even trying to ward off ants with a few drops around the windowsill, it never fails to impress. If you're a fan of peppermint, or you're looking to try something new and beneficial, Viva Doria's Northwest Peppermint Essential Oil deserves a spot in your collection.

One aspect of the oil that I wasn't too fond of was its consistency. It was a bit more oily than the ones I've used in the past, which made it a bit harder to disperse in the air. However, this didn't affect the overall performance of the oil significantly. 

As per the packaging, it seems that the brand has made some changes to their labeling. Some users have reported that after this change, the quality of the oil and its smell have been affected. I haven't noticed a significant difference yet, but this is something I'll keep an eye on in the future.
