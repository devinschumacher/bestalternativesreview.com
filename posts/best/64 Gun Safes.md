<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/64+Gun+Safes?utm_term=browning-64-gun-safe-extra-wide-enhanced-security"><img alt="browning-1878-65-1878-series-extra-wide-gun-safe-2024-model-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/browning-1878-65-1878-series-extra-wide-gun-safe-2024-model-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When I first laid my eyes on the Browning 1878-65, I was taken aback by its incredible size. The extra wide interior was a game changer, offering a whopping maximum capacity of 65 long guns on the DPX door rack with room spared for handguns, optics, and cameras. It's like having a canyon for your guns! And while it may look daunting with a height of 60 inches, the exterior depth of only 25 inches ensures it doesn't stick out like a sore thumb in your room. 

The safe is packed with features that speak of security and durability. With a fire rating of 90 minutes and a weight of 1,070 lbs, you can rest assured that your prized possessions are well-protected. The 11-gauge body thickness paired with the 14 active bolts makes this a formidable fortress for your firearms. 

However, the 1878-65 does have a hefty price tag of $4,299, which might be a deal-breaker for some. Despite this, I found the safe to be a worthwhile investment for gun enthusiasts who value security and convenience in one package.

It's like the mother of all safes, guarding your firearms with some serious fire protection – 110 minutes, if I remember right. 

That lock is beastly too - three bolts and a 4-way combination lock, ensuring nobody but you gets in. I had to fumble with it for a while, like unlocking a real-life fortress, but I guess safety's got to be a bit of a hassle. The interior's got some fantastic lighting, too, making it fun to rummage around, not that I'd ever dare, of course!

## Buyer's Guide

Welcome to our comprehensive buyer's guide for 64 gun safes. In this section, we'll dive into the essential features, considerations, and advice to help you make an informed decision when purchasing a 64 gun safe. Remember, the goal is to find a safe that meets your specific needs and provides the utmost level of security and protection for your firearms. 


### Size and Capacity

One of the primary factors to consider when buying a 64 gun safe is the size and capacity. Determine how many guns you need to store and whether you plan to add more in the future. A 64 gun safe typically accommodates up to 50-60 rifles, but it's essential to check the dimensions and interior layout to ensure it meets your needs. Pay attention to the safe's exterior size as well, especially if you have limited space in your home or garage. Consider the safety of the safe's mounting system, which should secure it firmly to prevent theft and reduce the risk of unauthorized access.

### Construction Quality

The construction quality of a 64 gun safe is crucial for ensuring its durability and security. Look for materials such as 14-gauge steel or higher, which provides stronger and more resistant protection. A solid door and extra-thick walls add to the overall strength of the safe. Additionally, consider the safe's locking mechanism, which should be made of hardened steel and contain multiple protective features, like drill-resistant plates and relocking devices. These features help prevent brute force and lock-picking attempts. 


### Fire Protection

Fire protection is another important factor to consider when buying a 64 gun safe. Look for safes that meet or exceed Underwriters Laboratories (UL) standards for fire resistance. A UL rating of 1 or 2 indicates that the safe can withstand a certain amount of heat and prevent the firearms from being damaged. Additionally, invest in a safe that has a Fire Safe Cigarette Test Certification (FSC) or similar certification. These certifications ensure the safe can withstand a fire caused by cigarettes or other small flames.

### Additional Features

Many 64 gun safes come with additional features that can enhance their functionality and security. These might include adjustable shelves, drawer compartments, dehumidifiers, and built-in lighting systems. Determine which features are most important to you and your specific needs. Additionally, consider the warranty offered by the manufacturer, as it may provide peace of mind and added protection for your investment.

### Why should I purchase a 64 gun safe?

A 64 gun safe is a valuable investment for gun owners who want to keep their firearms secure and organized. These safes offer ample space to store multiple guns, while also providing features such as dehumidification, interior lighting, and locking mechanisms to protect your firearms from damage and theft. 

Additionally, gun safes can help maintain the value of your firearms, ensuring they remain in good condition for years to come. They are an essential piece of equipment for any serious gun enthusiast who wants to protect their investment and keep their firearms safely stored at home or in a secure location. 


### What should I look for when choosing a 64 gun safe?

When selecting a 64 gun safe, there are several key factors to consider. First, assess the size of your gun collection and ensure the safe has enough space to accommodate your firearms. The dimensions of the safe are important, but so is the interior configuration, as it will determine how efficiently you can store your guns. 

Next, consider the locking mechanism and security features of the safe. A reliable lock and reinforced construction are essential for keeping your firearms secure from unauthorized access. Other features to look for include dehumidifiers to prevent rust and mold, lighting for easy access, and organization options to keep your guns neatly arranged.

### What is the best material for a 64 gun safe?

The most durable and secure material for a gun safe is steel. Steel gun safes offer exceptional protection against theft, fire, and other environmental hazards. They are often lined with fire-resistant materials and can withstand high temperatures, ensuring your firearms remain safely stored in the event of a fire. 

There are also some gun safes made from other materials, such as wood and composite materials. These options may offer a more aesthetically pleasing appearance, but they generally do not provide the same level of security and protection as steel gun safes. Ultimately, the choice of material will depend on your specific needs and budget. 


### What is the difference between a digital and mechanical lock on a 64 gun safe?

The main difference between a digital and mechanical lock on a 64 gun safe lies in the way they are operated and the level of security they provide. Digital gun safes use electronic locks with keypads, while mechanical locks require physical keys to be turned in order to open the safe. Both types of locks have pros and cons, and the choice between them will depend on your personal preferences and security needs. 

Digital gun safes are generally easier to operate and can be programmed with custom access codes. However, they are reliant on electricity and may be vulnerable to battery failure. Mechanical locks, on the other hand, do not require electricity and provide a more traditional, low-tech security solution. However, they can be more challenging to operate and require physical keys to be present to access the safe.

### What is the best way to maintain my 64 gun safe?

To maintain the longevity and performance of your 64 gun safe, it is essential to regularly inspect and clean it. Begin by checking the exterior for any signs of wear, rust, or damage. If you notice any issues, address them promptly to prevent further deterioration. Make sure to keep the safe in a dry, cool environment to protect it from humidity and temperature fluctuations that can cause rust and damage. 

Additionally, ensure that the locking mechanism is functioning properly and that the interior of the safe remains organized and free from debris. Regularly check the dehumidifier, if applicable, as it may need to be replaced or emptied over time. By properly maintaining your 64 gun safe, you can ensure that it remains a reliable and secure storage solution for your firearms for years to come. 


### How should I store my guns in a 64 gun safe?

Storing your guns in a 64 gun safe is essential for maintaining their safety, security, and value. When storing firearms, it is crucial to follow proper safety protocols to avoid accidents and ensure that your guns remain in good condition. Begin by carefully organizing your guns, ensuring that they are properly secured in their storage racks or compartments. 

Properly labeling your firearms and keeping them in a specific order can make it easier to locate and access them when needed. Additionally, wrap your guns in appropriate protective materials, such as felt or foam, to prevent scratches and dents. Finally, always handle your firearms carefully and follow local firearm storage laws to ensure that your 64 gun safe is being used safely and responsibly.
