### [Dyson Airwrap Multistyler: Warm Blue, Copper 1300W Styler](https://serp.ly/amazon/Dyson+Airwrap?utm\_term=dyson-airwrap-multistyler-warm-blue-copper-1300w-styler)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Dyson+Airwrap?utm_term=dyson-airwrap-multistyler-warm-blue-copper-1300w-styler"><img alt="dyson-airwrap-308-multistyler-warm-blue-copper-1300-w-2-675-m-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/dyson-airwrap-308-multistyler-warm-blue-copper-1300-w-2-675-m-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try out the Dyson Airwrap 308 Multistyler, and let me tell you, it sure lived up to the hype. This bad boy is designed for medium to long hair, and boy did it deliver on that promise. 

My first experience with it was a bit rocky, as it took some practice to get the hang of it. But once I did, wow, the results were truly impressive. The Airwrap is versatile, catering to different hair types and offering precise control over your curls, waves, and sleek finishes. The redesigned accessories work like a charm, making it so much easier to achieve the look I've always wanted. 

What really stood out to me is the multifunctional Coanda straightening dryer. It's a game-changer, allowing me to dry, smooth, and tame frizz all in one go. It's a bit noisy, but it's worth dealing with for the convenience it provides. 

However, there were a couple of downsides. The Airwrap took quite a while to style my hair, and it was quite heavy, causing some strain on my wrist after a while. The price tag is also a bit steep, but if you're serious about haircare, this might just be worth it. 

Overall, my experience with the Dyson Airwrap 308 Multistyler has been a positive one. It's definitely a styling tool that lives up to the expectations set by the brand name. But don't just take my word for it - give it a try and see if it's the right fit for your haircare needs.

### [Dyson Airwrap Multi-Styler: Premium Refurbished Hair Styler](https://serp.ly/amazon/Dyson+Airwrap?utm\_term=dyson-airwrap-multi-styler-premium-refurbished-hair-styler)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Dyson+Airwrap?utm_term=dyson-airwrap-multi-styler-premium-refurbished-hair-styler"><img alt="dyson-airwrap-multi-styler-complete-long-nickel-copper-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/dyson-airwrap-multi-styler-complete-long-nickel-copper-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Dyson Airwrap made an instant impression with its striking design, and as I unboxed it, I was eager to try it out. With its range of attachments engineered for different hair types, I knew that the Airwrap was capable of creating voluminous curls or waves, and straightening my hair too. The first thing I noticed was how powerful the airflow was, making it easy to style my hair with minimal fuss. And with the 13-blade impeller spinning at an incredible 110,000rpm, I knew I had a hair styler that was built to last. 

Switching between attachments was straightforward and hassle-free, thanks to the quick-release switch and cool-touch tip. The storage case kept everything well-organized, and I liked that it protected the Dyson Airwrap styler and its attachments from damage, especially when I was traveling. The Vinca Blue/Rose color variant may have been a personal favorite, but the build quality and power of this hair styler were undeniably impressive. 

While the Dyson Airwrap's Coanda styling pioneered by Dyson, the Coanda effect, did attract and wrap my hair without causing extreme heat damage, it sometimes tangled my hair, making the whole experience a bit frustrating. And despite its powerful 1,300 W motor, the drying time was quite long for my thick hair. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I'd say the Dyson Airwrap Multi-Styler Complete Long (in Nickel/Copper, Refurbished) is a game-changer for anyone looking to achieve a range of hairstyles minus the heat damage. Whether you have curly hair or prefer straight locks, this powerful hair styler is a worthy addition to your beauty routine. 


### [Dyson Airwrap Complete Hair Styler: Curl, Wave, Smooth with No Extreme Heat - Nickel/Fuchsia](https://serp.ly/amazon/Dyson+Airwrap?utm\_term=dyson-airwrap-complete-hair-styler-curl-wave-smooth-with-no-extreme-heat-nickel-fuchsia)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Dyson+Airwrap?utm_term=dyson-airwrap-complete-hair-styler-curl-wave-smooth-with-no-extreme-heat-nickel-fuchsia"><img alt="dyson-airwrap-complete-hair-styler-nickel-fuchsia-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/dyson-airwrap-complete-hair-styler-nickel-fuchsia-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Using the Dyson Airwrap Complete Hair Styler has been a breath of fresh air in my hair styling routine. First off, I appreciate the unique design that uses the Coanda effect to style and dry hair without damaging it with extreme heat. The combination of barrels and brushes means you can achieve various styles, whether it's a curl, wave, smooth or volumize. 

One of the reasons I found this styler incredibly easy to use is due to its lightweight and sleek build. The soft-touch handle and ergonomic design of the Airwrap allow for comfortable usage even during long styling sessions. Yet, the weight of this device could be an issue for some when used over an extended period. 

A standout feature that has impressed me is its smart temperature control feature. Measuring airflow temp 40 times a second, it prevents damage by ensuring it doesn't exceed an impressive 300°F. This precision in temperature distribution allows for long-lasting results without any damage or scorching. However, some users may find that it heats quickly. 

The Dyson Airwrap boasts a powerful V9 digital motor, which spins at up to 110,000rpm, creating enough pressure to create the Coanda effect. But what's even more amazing is the intelligent heat control feature that keeps the temperature in check all the time. 

Even after several uses, the Airwrap holds up well thanks to its build quality. It is durable and seems resistant to wear and tear. Cleaning it is a breeze too, as it's easy to dismantle with its magnetic detachments. 

In terms of usability, the customization possibilities are endless with the Dyson Airwrap. The 6 different attachments for different hair types (curly, wavy, straight), along with the 3-speed air flow, 3 heat settings, and the cold shot 82°F, really allow you to get creative with the styles you can achieve. 

One downside perhaps, the Dyson Airwrap is big and a little bulky, taking up more counter or storage space than smaller hair tools. But even that drawback is justifiable considering the advanced features that this tool provides. 

Overall, the Dyson Airwrap Complete Hair Styler is a high-quality investment for anyone looking to maintain healthy hair while styling in a salon-like manner at home. Its ease of use, innovative features, and versatility more than justify the price tag. It’s no wonder it's rated so highly by customers, making it a standout in the market.

### [Dyson Airwrap Multi-Styler Complete Long - Prussian Blue/Rich Copper Styling Tool](https://serp.ly/amazon/Dyson+Airwrap?utm\_term=dyson-airwrap-multi-styler-complete-long-prussian-blue-rich-copper-styling-tool)

My favorite feature of the Airwrap might just be its Coanda airflow – that's right, an aerodynamic phenomenon that lets the air attract and wrap my hair around the barrel or the surface of the brush. This eliminates the need for extreme heat, which not only speeds up my styling process but leaves my hair looking and feeling healthier. 

In my experience, the Airwrap's attachments are durable and made from a high-quality material. The smooth bristles and firm brushes glide through my hair effortlessly, without creating any tangles.

And when I want to sport a sleek, straight style, the round brushes do a fantastic job smoothing and adding shine. 

While I loved the Dyson Airwrap Multi-Styler Complete, I did encounter a few downsides. Firstly, the device's size can be a bit cumbersome, especially for those who need to travel frequently. My storage space was also limited, which made it difficult to keep everything organized. 

Another issue I encountered was that the Airwrap's airflow could sometimes get excessively hot, sometimes leading to a few moments of discomfort while styling. Finally, though it's not a deal-breaker, the travel bag that comes with the set is a little restrictive in carrying all the attachments, especially the larger ones. This might be a problem for people who prefer to pack everything neatly. 

Overall, I believe the Dyson Airwrap Multi-Styler Complete is a fantastic investment for anyone seeking a versatile and stylish hair styling tool. Its innovative technology and impressive range of attachments allow for endless styling possibilities, keeping my hair looking healthy and beautiful.
