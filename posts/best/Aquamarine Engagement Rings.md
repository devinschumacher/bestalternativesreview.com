## Buyer's Guide

Aquamarine engagement rings have become increasingly popular due to their unique, vibrant shade of blue and their eye-catching appeal. However, before making a purchase, it is essential to consider several factors to ensure you invest in the right ring for you. This buyer's guide will provide you with informative advice on key aspects that should be taken into account when purchasing an aquamarine engagement ring. 


### Shape

Aquamarine engagement rings can be found in various shapes, such as oval, round, emerald, pear, and cushion cuts. Each shape has its unique characteristics and can affect the ring's overall appearance. Oval and round cuts showcase the stone's maximum carat weight, providing a larger visual impact. Emerald cuts showcase the stone's clarity, while pear shapes add a touch of elegance and sophistication. Cushion cuts offer a contemporary and vibrant look. Choose the shape that best suits your personal style and complements the setting of the ring. 


### Carat Weight

The carat weight of an aquamarine engagement ring refers to the stone's size. When selecting the right carat weight, consider the wearer's lifestyle, budget, and personal preference. For a more modest design, opt for a smaller carat weight. For a more eye-catching ring, choose a larger carat weight. Remember that the stone's appearance and color will also impact its visual impact. A high-quality stone with a vibrant blue color will make a smaller ring appear more impressive. 


### Cut and Clarity

The cut and clarity of the aquamarine stone are essential factors that greatly influence the ring's overall aesthetic and value. A well-cut stone will showcase the gemstone's natural beauty, maximizing its color and brilliance. A high-quality cut will also enhance the stone's clarity, minimizing any inclusions or blemishes. Clarity grading can range from VS (Very Slightly Included) to FL (Flawless). Choose a stone with the desired clarity grade within your budget. 


### Setting and Metal

The setting and metal of an aquamarine engagement ring play a crucial role in its durability, style, and overall appearance. A sturdy prong or bezel setting will securely hold the stone in place and prevent it from slipping out or getting damaged. Choose a setting that complements the ring's design and enhances the stone's appearance. The metal used for the setting can be white gold, yellow gold, or platinum. Consider the wearer's skin tone and personal preference when selecting the metal for the ring.
