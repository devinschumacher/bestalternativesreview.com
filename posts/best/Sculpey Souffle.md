### [7-ounce Sculpey Souffle Ivory Polymer Clay for Jewelry and Home Decor](https://serp.ly/amazon/Sculpey+Souffle?utm\_term=7-ounce-sculpey-souffle-ivory-polymer-clay-for-jewelry-and-home-decor)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Sculpey+Souffle?utm_term=7-ounce-sculpey-souffle-ivory-polymer-clay-for-jewelry-and-home-decor"><img alt="sculpey-souffle-ivory-7oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sculpey-souffle-ivory-7oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Sculpey Souffle clay is like no other polymer clay you've ever worked with. It's lightweight, yet incredibly strong and versatile - making it the perfect choice for creating stunning jewelry, eye-catching home decor, and intricate sculptures. The clay's impressive ability to hold fine details and maintain a soft, pliable texture even after baking makes it an absolute joy to work with. 

One of the standout features of this premium oven-bake clay is its wide range of colors. Sculpey offers a vibrant array of hues, each sold separately, so you can mix and match to create the perfect shade for your project. And with its conformity to ASTM D 4236, you can trust that this clay will deliver consistent, high-quality results. 

However, this is not a one-size-fits-all clay. The lighter texture of Souffle can make blending and smoothing a bit more challenging than with other polymer clays. Additionally, some users have reported inconsistent streaking in certain colors, particularly the Ivory option. 

Despite these small drawbacks, Sculpey Souffle has captured the hearts of countless polymer clay enthusiasts - and for good reason. Its innovative formula, versatility, and beautiful results make it a worthwhile addition to any artist's arsenal.

As a polymer clay enthusiast, I was excited to try Sculpey Souffle in this vibrant grape color. The clay had a luxuriously soft texture that made it incredibly easy to work with, despite my initial reservations about its flexibility. The grape color turned out to be a bold and fashion-forward statement, perfect for making jewelry and accessories. 

One of the best things about Sculpey Souffle is its strong self-supporting nature, which prevents it from cracking when working on large creations. This versatility made it a joy to sculpt with, allowing me to experiment with different designs without worrying about the clay breaking. Another highlight was the clay's ability to maintain clean lines, even when sliced or trimmed. 

However, I did experience a limitation in the color range, as there were only three different hues available in the Souffle line. While this may not be a significant drawback for some users, those looking for a wider color selection may need to consider alternative clay options. 

Overall, Sculpey Souffle proved to be an excellent choice for polymer clay enthusiasts seeking flexibility, strong support, and bold color options.

The suede-like finish is another highlight, especially for fashion-forward projects. Its range of fashion-forward colors ensures that there's a perfect shade for every design imaginable. Sculpey Soufflé is the best clay for stamping, alcohol markers, and inks, making it highly versatile for any project. It takes textures well and maintains clean lines without dragging, even when sliced. The clay holds fine details like a charm and adds that extra touch of elegance. 

However, there are a couple of cons to consider. While the clay doesn't crack under pressure, it could take some time to condition if you're not used to working with polymer clay.
