The foam cradle was a little tricky to use at first, but once I figured it out, it worked great. The waterproof cover was another bonus, as it kept my essentials dry even in less-than-ideal weather conditions.

The Savior Specialist Mini Range Bag surprised me with its versatility. I was initially drawn to the pistol case's cushioned compartments, but this range bag's size struck a great balance. With two detachable magazine pouches for six standard capacity mags and two dump pouches, it was perfect for my range days. 

The semi-clear front panel and lockable admin pocket were a bonus, along with the cushioned shoulder strap that lays flat. The 600D polyester exterior and interior shell, knitted elastic bands, and lockable zippers provided durability and security.
