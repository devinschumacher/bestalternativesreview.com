Assembling the Coyaho was a breeze, taking only a minute to put it all together with the provided user manual and rubber rings. 

Now, let's talk about the not-so-awesome, or as I like to call it, the 'Coyaho improvement moments'. First, there's no denying that this organizer has a slightly flimsy build to it. I had to be extra cautious when handling and assembling the rotating makeup holder to ensure it stayed sturdy. I guess you can't have everything, huh? 

Finally, I noticed that the rubber rings provided as an attachment were slightly too small for my setup, causing the organizer to wobble and lose its stability. But, a quick fix to this issue was to simply use some extra rubber bands, which saved the day. 

Overall, the Coyaho 360° Rotating Makeup Organizer brings a touch of elegance and organization to my bathroom and countertop. The unique eco-friendly material and adjustable height are highlights that make this product stand out. And while there were a few hitches to work through, I'm confident that with a few tweaks, this will become a top-notch storage solution for all your makeup and skincare essentials.

Consider the amount of space you have on your countertop, as well as the number of products you want to store. Make sure the organizer is not too large or too small, while still providing enough room for all of your essentials.

### Which materials are frequently used in countertop makeup organizers?

Countertop makeup organizers feature a variety of materials like plastic, glass, acrylic, and metal. These materials offer varying levels of durability, scratch resistance, and style. Plastic organizers are often affordable and lightweight, while glass and acrylic provide a sleek appearance. Metal organizers, conversely, can deliver a more sturdy and upscale appearance, making them a suitable fit for those aiming to elevate their bathroom or vanity's style. 

Moreover, the materials used in countertop makeup organizers can influence their moisture resistance. Organizers fashioned from metal or enclosed compartments generally perform better at keeping makeup dry, so consider your bathroom or vanity's humidity levels when selecting an appropriate organizer material. 


### What steps should I take to maintain my countertop makeup organizer?

Regular cleaning is vital to ensure your countertop makeup organizer's longevity. Some simple maintenance tips include: 
1) frequent dusting and wiping down the organizer, and 2) disinfecting the compartments to prevent bacterial growth. The cleaning method may depend on the organizer's material. Use mild soap and water or a disinfecting spray for glass, acrylic, and metal organizers, and avoid harsh chemicals that could damage the finish. For plastic organizers, opt for a non-abrasive, alcohol-based cleaner to prevent discoloration over time. 

Additionally, avoid storing messy or moisture-resistant makeup items as they may harm or degrade the organizer. Organizing smaller items like brushes will also make cleaning and maintenance easier, as they accumulate dirt or moisture less readily than larger items, such as foundation bottles.

Countertop makeup organizers come in various sizes designed to accommodate different spaces, catering to a wide range of makeup storage needs. Generally, you can find compact organizers that only require about a square foot of counter space, making them a practical and space-saving option for those with limited counter space. Larger organizers can take up anywhere from 1 to 3 square feet of counter space, offering more storage options and accommodating a broader range of makeup items. 

When selecting a countertop makeup organizer, ensure it fits your desired space requirements without compromising accessibility. Look for organizers with adjustable compartments, drawers, or shelves to customize the layout and optimize your storage needs. Some organizers also offer stackable or modular units, allowing you to expand the organizer in the future if needed.
