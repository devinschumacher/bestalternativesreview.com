This was particularly helpful for someone who is not too familiar with installing toilet seats. The entire installation process was smooth and straightforward, thanks to the detailed guide provided.

I recently tried the Bemis Rise 4.5" Toilet Seat during a quick trip and it was a game-changer. The raised 4.5" seat made sitting and standing super comfortable, especially after a good meal. Its adjustable mounting base was a lifesaver as it fit both the round and elongated toilets perfectly. What really impressed me were its heavy-duty support arms, tested to hold up a massive 200lbs each side. 

However, I did notice it could use a bit more hygiene-friendly features, as their elongated ring hole could potentially get in the way of a certain level of personal hygiene. But hey, you can't have it all, right? 

Despite this minor inconvenience, it's definitely worth the investment. With its no-slip dual lock security feature, this toilet seat will become your trusty companion wherever you go. Say goodbye to the hassle of searching for the right toilet seat! 


### [Bemis Whisper-Close Plastic Toilet Seat in White](https://serp.ly/amazon/Bemis+Toilet+Seat?utm\_term=bemis-whisper-close-plastic-toilet-seat-in-white)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Bemis+Toilet+Seat?utm_term=bemis-whisper-close-plastic-toilet-seat-in-white"><img alt="bemis-whisper-close-round-plastic-toilet-seat-white-730slec-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bemis-whisper-close-round-plastic-toilet-seat-white-730slec-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

This Bemis toilet seat is a white, round plastic piece with a closed front design. It's manufactured by a company that's been bringing innovation, value, and eco-friendly products for a while now. The best part about this seat is that it's very quiet - both the cover and the ring close gradually and whisper-quietly, preventing slamming and protecting your fingers from getting pinched. 

Despite its quiet operation, it's also effortless to remove the seat for cleaning or to swap it out. The hardware, with non-corroding bolts and wing nuts, is a great addition as well since it means less worrying about rust and maintenance. The plastic used, resilient and molded-in color, fights wear, stains, and chips effectively. 

Besides, the seat color-matches the bumpers and the hinges, adding a touch of style to your bathroom. Its compatibility with most round toilets, including those made in the USA, is a bonus that shows Bemis' commitment to their products. 

Now, while this toilet seat is great, it does have its challenges. One reviewer pointed out a flaw with manufacturing - the seat not being centered, and its inability to be adjusted horizontally after installation. There's also the issue of its late delivery. It's clear that if Bemis could address these concerns, this product would be near perfect. 

However, the pros do seem to outweigh the cons. So, if you're on the hunt for a quiet, easy-to-remove, and long-lasting toilet seat without the noise and slamming, this one from Bemis might just be worth considering.

I recently tried out the Bemis 75 000 Round Open Front Toilet Seat and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. The first thing that caught my attention was its sturdy build - it's made from resilient plastic which means it resists chips, wears, and stains. Also, the hex-tite bolt system adds to its stability, providing a wobble-free installation. 

One of the highlights of this toilet seat is its open front design. It's perfect for those who have some extra space requirements or are larger in size. In fact, it's a real game-changer if you're struggling to find a comfortable seat. 

However, there are a couple of things that could be improved. For starters, it doesn't come with a soft-close feature, which is quite common these days. I also found the mount bolts to be a bit on the shorter side, so make sure you have your old ones handy. 

Overall, I think the Bemis 75 000 Round Open Front Toilet Seat is a solid choice for a basic commercial application. It's comfortable, sturdy, and does the job it's intended to do. It's not perfect, but it certainly gets the job done.

It fits perfectly on elongated toilets from various manufacturers, including Kohler, American Standard, and TOTO. The seat even comes with a 4-bumpers design to further enhance its stability and longevity. 

However, despite the positive aspects, some users have reported a design flaw in the back of the lid, which makes it difficult to attach lid covers due to the curve. While this may not be a significant issue for some, it does impact the overall aesthetics and customization options for the toilet setup. The JUST∙LIFT feature is a convenient addition for cleaning purposes, but it may be a challenge for some users to operate daily. 

In summary, the Bemis Toilet Seat Elongated offers a sturdy and reliable solution for commercial and personal settings.
