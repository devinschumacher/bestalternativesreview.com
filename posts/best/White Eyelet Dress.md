### [Mud Pie Lula White Eyelet Dress](https://serp.ly/amazon/White+Eyelet+Dress?utm\_term=mud-pie-lula-white-eyelet-dress)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/White+Eyelet+Dress?utm_term=mud-pie-lula-white-eyelet-dress"><img alt="mud-pie-white-lula-eyelet-dress-large-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mud-pie-white-lula-eyelet-dress-large-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently added the Lula White Eyelet Dress to my wardrobe, and I've been absolutely loving it. The delicate flutter sleeves and playful ruffle collar make this dress a real showstopper, and it's incredibly versatile! It fits true to size and looks fantastic with heels or flats, making it perfect for both casual and dressy occasions. 

One of my favorite features of this dress is how easy it is to care for. While it might be a bit more fussy than some others, the fact that it's machine-washable with cold water and non-chlorine bleach for stains makes it worthwhile. Simply air dry it, and you'll be ready for your next outing. 

Of course, since it's made of 100% cotton, it's nice and comfortableâ€”perfect for warmer summer days! The lining is also a great addition, providing shape and preventing any pesky transparency issues that can sometimes occur with flimsy dresses. 

My only criticisms are that it might not be the most budget-friendly option, and perhaps the length could have been slightly longer for petite ladies. Other than that, the Lula White Eyelet Dress has become a staple in my wardrobe, and I'm sure it will be yours too!

The concealed back zipper is a great feature, especially for those who want to showcase the dress without any obvious fastening. 

The lightweight cotton fabric is perfect for warmer months, and the 100% cotton material ensures it's breathable and easy to care for. However, I found the flutter sleeves slightly too long for my preference, and while the dress itself is lined, I wish the sleeves had been lined as well. 

Overall, I enjoyed wearing this midi dress, and it's a great addition to my summer wardrobe. But it might not be the most suitable option for those with shorter heights or specific sleeve preferences.

### [White Eyelet Puff Sleeves Shift Dress by Msk Petites](https://serp.ly/amazon/White+Eyelet+Dress?utm\_term=white-eyelet-puff-sleeves-shift-dress-by-msk-petites)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/White+Eyelet+Dress?utm_term=white-eyelet-puff-sleeves-shift-dress-by-msk-petites"><img alt="msk-petites-womens-eyelet-puff-sleeves-shift-dress-true-white-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/msk-petites-womens-eyelet-puff-sleeves-shift-dress-true-white-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

A few weeks ago, I stumbled upon the Msk Petites Women's Eyelet Puff Sleeves Shift Dress in true white. I was curious to see how it would look on me, so I decided to give it a try. 

When I received it, I was surprised by the quality of the fabric - it felt soft and luxurious. The eyelet detailing on the sleeves added a touch of sophistication to the dress, making it a standout piece in my wardrobe. 

Despite the dress being lined, I found it a little snug in the top area. I would suggest trying a size up if you're between sizes. The length was perfect for me, hitting right above my knees, which made it easy to wear with various shoes. 

Unfortunately, the dress didn't flatter my figure as much as I had hoped. The sleeves were a bit too long, and the body of the dress just hung on me instead of hugging my curves. In the end, I decided to return it. 

In conclusion, the Msk Petites Women's Eyelet Puff Sleeves Shift Dress in true white is a beautiful piece with eye-catching details, but it may not be the perfect fit for everyone. It's worth considering trying a size up if you're between sizes, and for those with different body types, this dress might not be the most flattering choice. 


### [Eyelet Midi Dress in Ivory](https://serp.ly/amazon/White+Eyelet+Dress?utm\_term=eyelet-midi-dress-in-ivory)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/White+Eyelet+Dress?utm_term=eyelet-midi-dress-in-ivory"><img alt="tahari-asl-button-front-cotton-eyelet-midi-dress-in-ivory-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tahari-asl-button-front-cotton-eyelet-midi-dress-in-ivory-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I had the pleasure of trying on this lovely ASL Button Front Cotton Eyelet Midi Dress in Ivory, and while it caught my eye at first, it didn't quite fit my expectations. Upon arrival, I was excited to wear this dainty, eyelet-striped sundress that had such a playful silhouette. 

However, when I slipped it on, I found it to be quite roomy, and it didn't fit comfortably around my waist. It was as if the dress was designed for someone who needs more space, which definitely wasn't me. 

The fabric, made of pure cotton, felt soft and light. Yet, its lack of structure and shape made the dress fall rather poorly on my body. I was initially drawn to the enchanting eyelet detailing, but the overall impression was one of loose, shapeless fabric that lacked any defining style or elegance. 

I do appreciate the use of pompom trim, which added a touch of whimsy to the dress. It was a nice, cheerful touch that made it stand out, but the pompoms themselves were a bit flimsy and didn't seem to hold up well with the cotton fabric. 

With my purchase, I expected the eyelet detailing to be more delicate and finely crafted. Though this dress might be perfect for someone who is looking for a casual and roomy fit, it unfortunately wasn't the right fit for me. 

In summary, the Tahari ASL Button-Front Cotton Eyelet Midi Dress in Ivory had its pros and cons. While it offered a unique design with intricate eyelet detailing and a lovely pompom trim, it fell short in the categories of fit and construction. As a disappointment, it was returned, and I hope that future customers will find the perfect dress for their style and taste.

### [Steve Madden White Eyelet Mini Dress - Cotton and Pull On Closure](https://serp.ly/amazon/White+Eyelet+Dress?utm\_term=steve-madden-white-eyelet-mini-dress-cotton-and-pull-on-closure)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/White+Eyelet+Dress?utm_term=steve-madden-white-eyelet-mini-dress-cotton-and-pull-on-closure"><img alt="steve-madden-womens-jayda-eyelet-mini-dress-white-size-xs-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/steve-madden-womens-jayda-eyelet-mini-dress-white-size-xs-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried on the Steve Madden Women's Jayda Eyelet Mini Dress in white, and I must say, it was a unique and fun experience! The mini-length and feminine eyelet details on this dress definitely give it that fairy-like feel. It was great for both casual and dressy occasions - perfect from a brunch to cocktail party. 

One thing that stood out to me was the length of the dress. Many white dresses I've tried in the past have been too long, but this one was just right - not too long and not too short. The ruffled bottom added a cute touch to the dress as well, making it unique and eye-catching. 

The cotton fabric was soft and comfy, and the design was surprisingly not see-through even though it's white. Some of the reviewers mentioned that it could seem a bit transparent, but I definitely didn't have that issue. This dress also came with a cinched waist and flared skirt - both super feminine and flattering. 

Although it fits perfectly and looks great, I'd recommend paying close attention to the sizing, as it may run slightly large, making the armholes slightly loose for some people. Additionally, it might not be the best option for taller women, as their height could slightly alter the skirt's length. 

Overall, this Steve Madden Women's Jayda Eyelet Mini Dress is an adorable and versatile addition to any woman's wardrobe. It's perfect for spring and summer and can easily be dressed up or down for various occasions. This white eyelet dress is a cute and comfortable choice for those looking for a unique and feminine option in their wardrobe.
