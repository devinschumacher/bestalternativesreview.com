### [Decora Smart Wi-Fi 2nd Gen Scene Controller - Customizable Lighting Control for Smart Homes](https://serp.ly/amazon/Smart+Switch?utm\_term=decora-smart-wi-fi-2nd-gen-scene-controller-customizable-lighting-control-for-smart-homes)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Smart+Switch?utm_term=decora-smart-wi-fi-2nd-gen-scene-controller-customizable-lighting-control-for-smart-homes"><img alt="leviton-decora-smart-wi-fi-2nd-gen-scene-controller-switch-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/leviton-decora-smart-wi-fi-2nd-gen-scene-controller-switch-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Decora Smart Wi-Fi 2nd Gen Scene Controller Switch, and I have to say, it's pretty impressive. This little gem replaced my old light switch and made things a whole lot smarter. The installation process was super easy, and I'm a big fan of the quick switch from ON to OFF. 

The added custom lighting scenes were a game changer. I could schedule 'Movie Time' or 'All Off' to run at specific times, all through the My Leviton or Apple HomeKit app. It supports a range of lighting options including LED, CFL, Halogen, and even motors. That made it perfect for controlling various lights in different rooms. 

But don't think it only works with Leviton devices; it's IFTTT compatible too. I could use the scenes to activate my vacuum cleaner or turn on the kettle. Although it doesn't support Wi-Fi network connection, the switch worked with Alexa and Google Assistants for voice control, which I found really cool. 

Unfortunately, it doesn't come with a hub for voice control. But the good news is, it doesn't require one. It also lacks some advanced functionalities like a dimmer switch, which would definitely be a nice addition. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, the Decora Smart Wi-Fi 2nd Gen Scene Controller Switch really has transformed my home into a more flexible, smarter, and convenient place. A big thumbs up for this little device!

When choosing between a Smart Switch and a Smart Plug, consider the type of devices you wish to control and the specific features you require. If you want to manage a large number of devices or have advanced energy management capabilities, a Smart Switch may be a better option. However, if you prefer a more straightforward solution for individual appliances or have limited wiring options, a Smart Plug may be more suitable.
