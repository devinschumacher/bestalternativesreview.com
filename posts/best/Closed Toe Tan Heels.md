A few months ago, I stumbled upon the Paulina Wide Width Pump in tan by Journee Collection. Intrigued by the retro touch with the pointed toe and kitten heel, I decided to give it a go, hoping it would fit well and be comfortable. I picked my favorite shade, tan, in size US 10 and eagerly awaited my delivery.

I recently tried on the Kenneth Cole Bri Platform Pump in Buff Beige at Nordstrom, and I must say, it was quite an experience. I was initially drawn to the polyurethane upper and manmade lining, which gave the shoe a sleek and stylish look. The slip-on style made it easy to put on and take off, but I found the square toe design a bit awkward at times. 

The platform heel and TPR outsole made the shoe surprisingly comfortable for daily wear. However, I also noticed that the heel height and platform height were quite high, which might not be the best choice for all occasions. I enjoyed the shoe's overall design and the fact that it was imported, but I do wish there were some options for people with narrow feet. 

Overall, the Kenneth Cole Bri Platform Pump in Buff Beige had its pros and cons, but I would recommend it for those looking for a comfortable, stylish option for everyday wear. Keep in mind that it might not be the best choice for certain events or occasions due to the heel height and platform height.
