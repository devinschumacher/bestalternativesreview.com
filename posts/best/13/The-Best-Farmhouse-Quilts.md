### What makes a quilt "farmhouse" style?

farmhouse quilts blend traditional quilt patterns with natural, earthy fabrics and neutral color palettes. They often incorporate elements like hand-stitching, rustic fabrics, and simple designs that evoke a vintage country feel. 

These quilts typically feature bold geometric shapes, florals, and stripes in soft, natural tones like cream, white, and warm beige, creating a cozy and inviting centerpiece for any bedroom. 


### How are farmhouse quilts made?

farmhouse quilts combine meticulous hand-sewing techniques with modern quilting tools. The quilting process involves layering soft cotton or flannel fabric with batting and a cotton backing, then sewing these layers together using durable, visible thread.
