## Buyer's Guide

Security bolts are a crucial component in enhancing the safety of doors and windows, providing an extra layer of protection against forced entry. Understanding their features and applications will help you select the right bolt for your security needs. 


### Material and Construction

Quality security bolts are typically made from hardened steel or stainless steel, offering durability and resistance to damage. The construction should include multiple locking mechanisms, such as pin tumbler locks and ward protection, to increase security. Consider bolts with concealed screws and flush-mount options for maintaining a clean, professional appearance. 


### Length and Installation

Security bolts come in various lengths to accommodate different door thicknesses, ranging from 1 to 3 inches. Proper installation is essential for optimal security. Each bolt should include detailed mounting instructions and all necessary hardware for secure installation. Consider bolts that can be installed from both sides of the door for increased convenience. 


### Locking Mechanisms

A secure bolt requires robust locking mechanisms that resist picking and brute force attacks. Look for bolts with at least a 7-point lock system, including pins, warded, and cylindrical locks. Some advanced models feature electronic keyless entry or smart lock capabilities for enhanced security and convenience. 


### Installation Considerations

Installation requirements vary based on the bolt's design and your specific application. Consider factors like door thickness, material, and existing hardware before selecting a bolt. Some bolts require drilling and mounting plates, while others use simple screws. Choose a bolt that matches your existing hardware and installation setup for a seamless installation process. 


## FAQ


### What is a security bolt?

A security bolt is a locking mechanism that extends from the inside of a door frame to secure the door in place. Unlike regular door bolts, security bolts are designed to resist forced entry and can be much longer, making them more difficult to bypass. 

These specialized bolts incorporate features like thicker metal construction, multiple locking points, and sometimes keyless electronic locks for enhanced security. 


### How do security bolts compare to regular door bolts?

Standard door bolts provide basic security by locking the door in place. They typically extend from the door into a strike plate mounted on the frame. Security bolts, in contrast, extend much farther into the frame, often with additional locking mechanisms and heavier construction. 

This extra length and security features make them significantly more resistant to common entry methods like kickouts and lock picking. 


### What types of security bolts are available?

Security bolts come in various types, including surface-mounted, flush-mounted, and angle bolts. Surface-mounted bolts project outward from the door frame and are visible when closed. Flush-mounted bolts sit flush with the frame when closed, providing a cleaner appearance. Angle bolts extend at an angle to combine both surface and flush-mounting benefits. 

There are also decorative options that incorporate security features into ornamental designs, as well as specialized variants for different applications like garage doors or industrial security. 


### How do you install a security bolt?

Installation typically requires careful measurement and precise drilling to accommodate the bolt's length and mounting hardware. The frame requires expansion holes for the bolt to seat properly, and the strike plate or mounting plate must be securely attached. 

For most installations, professional assistance is recommended due to the specialized requirements and potential damage to the frame if misaligned. 


### What are the key considerations when choosing a security bolt?

The primary considerations are the security level needed, the door frame material and thickness, and the desired installation location. The bolt's length and mounting type should match the door's design and your security requirements. 

Additional factors include the bolt's locking mechanism, warranty coverage, and compatibility with existing hardware. Durability, ease of operation, and maintenance requirements are also important aspects to evaluate. 


### How much do security bolts cost?

Entry-level security bolts typically range from $20 to $50 each, while premium models with advanced features can cost between $50 and $150. Installation costs vary based on the complexity of the job, with basic installations costing $50 to $100 and professional installations potentially exceeding $200. 

Costs can increase significantly for specialized mounting requirements, custom frames, or installation in unusual locations like sliding doors or heavy-duty applications.
