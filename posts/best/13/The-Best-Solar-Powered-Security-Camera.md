### What is a solar-powered security camera?

A solar-powered security camera is a surveillance system that uses solar energy to power its components. This type of camera typically includes a built-in solar panel that charges an integrated battery, allowing the camera to operate continuously even during cloudy or nighttime conditions. 

These cameras are designed for outdoor use and often feature daytime color and nighttime infrared (IR) vision capabilities. They can stream video directly to your smartphone or computer and store recordings on local SD cards or cloud-based services. 


### How does a solar-powered security camera work?

Solar-powered security cameras use photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight into electrical energy. The solar panel charges an internal battery, which powers the camera's main unit. When sunlight is unavailable, the battery provides power through its stored energy. 

These cameras use motion detection to activate their video recording and transmission functions. After capturing footage, they either store it on an SD card or transmit it to a cloud service for later access.
