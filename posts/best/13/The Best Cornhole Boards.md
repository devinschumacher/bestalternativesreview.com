## Buyer's Guide

Cornhole boards represent a simple yet charming outdoor game that combines skill with a touch of competition. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the perfect set for your yard or social gatherings. 


### Material Quality and Durability

The board's material significantly impacts its longevity and play experience. Common options include solid wood, composite, and plastic. Solid wood boards, typically made from cedar or pine, offer excellent durability and natural resistance to weather elements. Composite and plastic boards provide greater impact resistance and consistent texture, making them suitable for high-traffic environments.

### Size and Dimensions

Standard cornhole boards measure 2 feet by 4 feet, with a 1.5-inch thick playing surface. These dimensions ensure fair play and consistent scoring. While smaller or larger boards are available, sticking to the standard size helps maintain game consistency across different sets. 


### Design and Personalization

From traditional designs to modern graphics, cornhole boards offer opportunities for personalization. The playing surface's design should complement your outdoor space while providing clear visibility of scoring holes. Some boards feature contrasting colors between the surface and edge, while others include detailed artwork around the edge.

When selecting sets, consider the included accessories and their quality. Premium sets may feature padded handles on bean bags, while others include carrying bags for convenient transport. 


## FAQ

![Cornhole-Boards-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cornhole-Boards-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What materials are used to make cornhole boards?

Cornhole boards are typically made from two main materials: melamine and hardwood. Melamine boards are budget-friendly and durable, while hardwood boards, usually made from maple or walnut, offer premium quality with natural grain patterns. Both materials withstand outdoor weather conditions and provide a consistent playing surface. 

The playing surface is slightly recessed in the center, forming an incline towards the edges. This design prevents sagging and ensures the board remains level. The playing surface should measure exactly 27 inches by 27 inches, with 2-inch-by-2-inch drainage holes drilled along the sides to prevent water accumulation. 


### How heavy are cornhole boards, and how do I move them?

Melamine cornhole boards typically weigh between 25 to 35 pounds, while hardwood boards can be significantly heavier, usually ranging from 45 to 70 pounds. Due to their weight, it's essential to plan the placement before purchasing and consider how you'll move them, especially if you're storing them in an attic or shed. 

For moving, use at least two people to carry the board by its edges. Melamine boards can sometimes be stacked and carried together, but hardwood boards should always be handled individually to prevent damage. Consider investing in board trolleys or dollies for easier transportation and storage. 

![Cornhole-Boards-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cornhole-Boards-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the standard dimensions for cornhole bags?

Cornhole bags should measure exactly 6 inches long by 3 inches high, with a 1-inch-thick foam core. The fabric thickness should allow for consistent bounce and roll. The bag's dimensions are crucial for fair gameplay, as larger or smaller bags can affect the outcome of the match. 

While standard bags are pre-sewn, some DIY enthusiasts may alter the size. However, any changes should maintain the same 6x3x1-inch specifications to preserve the game's integrity and balance between players. 


### How do I choose the right cornhole board height?

Cornhole boards should be placed 27 inches above the ground, with the playing surface 4 inches off the ground. This height ensures proper bag flight and consistent gameplay. The pitching area should be marked 9 feet away from the back edge of the board, allowing players to stand 2 to 3 feet from the front edge for optimal tossing distance. 

If you're setting up on uneven ground, use levelers or shims to ensure the board remains perfectly vertical. For grassy surfaces, place the board on a wood frame or concrete block to maintain stability and prevent scooting during gameplay. 

![Cornhole-Boards-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cornhole-Boards-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the official rules for cornhole scoring?

When playing with two teams, each team member takes turns tossing their bags. A bag on the board scores 1 point, while a bag that lands in the cup scores 3 points. The first team to reach 21 points wins the game. If both teams reach 21 points simultaneously, the game continues until one team leads by 2 points. 

For single-player games, the player tosses one bag at a time, aiming for the opposing team's board. If the bag hits the board but remains in the air, it's known as a "hang, " and the opponent gets the point. The game continues until one player reaches 21 points. 


### How do I maintain and store my cornhole board?

After each game, wipe down the playing surface with a dry cloth to remove any dirt or debris. For melamine boards, occasional cleaning with mild soap and water is sufficient. Hardwood boards benefit from regular conditioning with furniture wax or sealant to prevent moisture damage and preserve the wood's natural finish. 

When storing your board, avoid direct sunlight and extreme temperature changes, which can warp the material. For wood boards, consider applying a protective sealant before storage. Store indoors if possible, using the included carrying bag to protect the board during transport or during the off-season.
