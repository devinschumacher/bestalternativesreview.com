## Buyer's Guide

White Shoulders Perfume has become a staple in many women's wardrobes since its introduction in 1985. This classic fragrance offers a versatile scent that can transition from daytime wear to evening occasions. Understanding the nuances of White Shoulders and what makes it special will help you choose the right iteration for your personal style. 


### Eau de Toilette vs. Eau de Parfum

White Shoulders is available in several concentrations, each offering a different level of intensity and longevity. Eau de Toilette provides a fresh, manageable fragrance with moderate projection, ideal for everyday wear.

### Key Scent Notes

White Shoulders combines top notes of white rose and freesia with heart notes of jasmine and gardenia. This creates a fresh, floral aroma that evolves into base notes of vanilla and musk. The balanced blend of warmth and freshness makes it adaptable to various occasions and personal styles. 


### Application and Layering

To optimize your White Shoulders experience, apply the fragrance sparingly and allow it to absorb into your skin. The pulse points (wrists, neck, behind ears) retain scent best. Consider layering with complementary scents, such as a delicate body lotion or ambient candles featuring similar floral accords.
