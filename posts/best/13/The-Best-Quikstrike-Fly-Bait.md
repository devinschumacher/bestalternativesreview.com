## FAQ


### What is Quikstrike Fly Bait?

Quikstrike Fly Bait is a mosquito control product that uses an innovative flying bait technology to eliminate mosquitoes in your yard. The bait works by attracting mosquitoes and luring them into a trap, where they ingest a potent mosquito-killing formula. 

This unique approach to mosquito control offers several advantages, including precise targeting of adult mosquitoes, reduced risk of pesticide exposure, and less frequent application compared to traditional methods. 


### How effective is Quikstrike Fly Bait?

Independent studies have shown that Quikstrike Fly Bait can reduce local mosquito populations by up to 90%. The effectiveness primarily depends on proper placement and regular refilling of the bait stations. 

The product is particularly effective in eliminating common yard pests like Aedes mosquitoes, which can carry diseases like Zika and West Nile virus. 


### What areas can Quikstrike Fly Bait treat?

Each Quikstrike Fly Bait station treats up to 3,000 square feet of outdoor space. The recommended spacing between stations is approximately 12-15 feet. 

These compact stations are suitable for both residential and commercial properties, making them versatile for various application sizes. 


### How long do the effects of Quikstrike Fly Bait last?

The active ingredients in Quikstrike Fly Bait start working immediately upon application. The bait stations need to be refilled every 2-4 weeks, depending on conditions like temperature and local mosquito activity levels. 

When properly maintained, a single bait station can provide effective mosquito control for several months at a time. 


### Are Quikstrike Fly Bait stations safe for pets and wildlife?

Quikstrike Fly Bait is specifically designed to be safe for pets and wildlife. The active ingredient targets mosquitoes and other flying insects, leaving non-target animals unharmed. 

However, it's important not to place bait stations near bird baths or other water sources where they might inadvertently come into contact with unprotected animals. 


### What maintenance is required for Quikstrike Fly Bait stations?

Regular maintenance consists of checking that each station remains upright and intact, refilling with the provided bait pellets as directed, and ensuring there's enough water in the reservoir. 

During intense mosquito seasons or in areas with high rainfall, more frequent monitoring and refilling may be necessary to maintain optimal protection.
