## Buyer's Guide

Brown kraft paper is a versatile material commonly used for packaging, craft projects, and protective wrapping. Understanding its properties and applications can help you choose the right type for your needs. 


### Material Composition

Brown kraft paper is made from 100% unbleached wood pulp, typically from renewable forest resources. This natural composition gives it superior strength and resistance to punctures compared to bleached paper products. 


### Thickness and Weight

Choosing the right thickness depends on your application. Standard kraft paper comes in weights from 20 to 120 lb (45-270 gsm). Thicker weights provide better protection for fragile items but are heavier to ship. 


### Breathability and Moisture Resistance

Brown kraft paper is naturally breathable, making it ideal for items that need air circulation. It also has better moisture resistance than traditional paper, preventing water damage to contents during shipping. 


### Printing and Customization Options

While brown kraft paper doesn't accept printing ink well, it can be combined with clear or colored film for window applications. For personalized packaging, consider printing on the outer film layer or using kraft paper with pre-applied clear windows.
