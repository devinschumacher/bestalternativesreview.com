## Buyer's Guide

Hiboy scooters combine affordability with decent performance, making them a popular choice for short commutes and casual rides. When selecting a Hiboy scooter, several key factors will influence your decision, including the type of scooter, size and weight capacity, motor and battery specifications, and overall build quality. 


### Motor and Battery Specifications

The motor determines the scooter's power and performance, with higher wattage generally meaning more speed and torque. Look for a motor between 350-750 watts for a good balance of power and efficiency. The battery capacity, measured in watt-hours, affects range and running time - 24-48V 10Ah batteries are common and offer decent performance for daily commuting. 


### Size and Weight Capacity

Standard Hiboy scooters measure around 190-200cm long, with folding models available for easier storage and transport. The weight capacity typically ranges from 100-150kg, though heavier riders may want to consider models rated for 180kg. Consider your own weight and any additional gear you'll be carrying when selecting a size and weight capacity. 


### Build Quality and Components

Check the frame material - aluminum is common and offers a good balance of strength and weight. The wheels should have proper clearance for the tire size, with larger wheels (10-inch or more) generally providing a smoother ride. The handlebars and deck should be comfortable for long rides, with grip tape providing good traction. 


### Additional Features to Consider

Key features include reliable brakes (disc brakes offer better stopping power), efficient lighting (Hiboy scooters typically have a front headlight and taillight), and practical storage options (like small compartments for keys or documents). Consider whether you prefer a traditional longboard design or a more compact scooter style, as this will affect your riding posture and comfort. 


## FAQ


### What's the difference between the Hiboy X1 and X3 scooter models?

The Hiboy X1 sports a sleek aluminum frame, adjustable handlebars, and comes with dual V-brakes for safety. It features a powerful 480W motor and travels up to 20 miles on a single charge. The X3 upgrades this with a step-through frame, LED headlights, and a more robust 625W motor, allowing for speeds of 20 mph and a range of 25 miles. 

Both models include a digital display, USB ports, and hydraulic handbrakes, but the X3 adds Bluetooth connectivity, a larger capacity battery, and improved hill-climbing ability. The X3 also features a more comfortable standover height and a more premium build quality. 


### How long does it take to charge a Hiboy scooter's battery?

The charging time varies by model. The X1's battery typically takes 4-6 hours to fully charge from empty, while the X3's larger battery requires 6-8 hours of charging time. 

Both models can be powered by a standard 110V wall outlet or a 12V car adapter, making it convenient to charge at home or in your vehicle. 


### What safety features do Hiboy scooters have?

Every Hiboy scooter includes hydraulic handbrakes, a digital display with speedometer and battery level indicator, and LED taillight. The X3 models add Bluetooth connectivity for speed and battery monitoring on your smartphone. 

The scooters also feature compact designs with standover heights under 30 inches, making them comfortable for riders up to 6'2". The X3 includes a more aggressive fork stance for better stability. 


### What's the maximum weight capacity for Hiboy scooters?

Both the X1 and X3 are rated for riders weighing up to 220 pounds. The X3's step-through frame design provides slightly more stability for heavier riders by lowering the center of gravity. 

These scooters are built to handle robust testing, including 220-pound riders, but maximum weight ratings are based on optimal performance and safety standards. 


### How do Hiboy scooters handle in different weather conditions?

While Hiboy scooters are designed for urban commuting, they're not recommended for extreme weather conditions. The motors and electronic components perform best in temperatures between 32-104Â°F (0-40Â°C). 

In wet or snowy conditions, use caution as the tires may slip. The LED taillight helps visibility in low light, but always wear proper protective gear and follow local traffic laws. 


### Can Hiboy scooters be customized with components from other brands?

Hiboy recommends using only official Hiboy parts and accessories for maintenance and customization. While some third-party components may fit, they may not be compatible with the scooter's electronics or warranty requirements. 

If you choose to customize, ensure all components meet the scooter's voltage and current specifications to avoid damage to the motor, battery, or electronic systems.
