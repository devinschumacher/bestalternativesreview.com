## FAQ


### What is Disney Silverware?

Disney Silverware combines the iconic characters and designs from the Mouse House's popular movies and TV shows with practical, everyday dining accessories. Each piece is crafted to resemble well-known characters like Mickey Mouse, princesses from the Disney Princess line, and beloved animal friends from films like Zootopia and Cars. 

The collection includes everything from spoons and forks to smaller items like butter knives and salt and pepper shakers, allowing families to coordinate their table settings with their favorite Disney characters. 


### What materials are Disney Silverware pieces made from?

The majority of Disney Silverware is made from stainless steel, known for its durability and ability to maintain a shiny finish. Some character details might include plastic or resin components for larger accessories, while smaller items like butter knives may contain metal and plastic elements. 

Much of the collection features nickel-plated finishes to prevent scratches and enhance the visual appeal of the characters' designs. Special edition pieces might incorporate different materials, like pewter or bronze, though these are less common. 


### How can I care for Disney Silverware?

Most Disney Silverware requires basic care similar to other stainless steel utensils. Hand wash with mild detergent and warm water, avoiding harsh chemicals that could damage the finish. For occasional maintenance, a soft cloth can be used with a mild steel polish to restore shine. 

Avoid using abrasive cleaners or steel wool, as these can scratch both the steel and the character designs. If your pieces include plastic or resin elements, be extra careful during cleaning to prevent damage to these parts. 


### Are Disney Silverware pieces dishwasher safe?

Disney Silverware features designed specifically for dishwasher use, making them convenient for everyday cleaning. These pieces can go through the dishwasher's normal cycle along with your other dishes, saving time and effort in manual washing. 

While dishwashers make cleaning easier, some enthusiasts prefer hand washing high-detail items to prevent damage to plastic elements or to maintain the character designs in pristine condition. 


### What sizes are available in Disney Silverware sets?

Disney Silverware typically comes in standard sizes suitable for most dining needs. Forks and spoons measure around 7 to 8 inches long, with butter knives measuring slightly longer at about 10 inches. Many sets include 6 to 8 pieces per serving, allowing for full meals or coordinating table settings. 

For larger gatherings or complete table settings, some collections offer extended lengths or separate smallware options like teaspoons and dessert forks. These longer pieces can be as much as 12 inches in length for special occasion settings. 


### How much does Disney Silverware cost?

The cost of Disney Silverware varies based on the collection and whether you're purchasing a full set or individual pieces. Standard stainless steel sets typically range from $20 to $50, while special editions or limited releases can go for $50 to $150 per set. 

Independent pieces or smaller accessories usually fall between $5 and $20, making them accessible for both casual collectors and families looking to match their existing character-themed dishes.
