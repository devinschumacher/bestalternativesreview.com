## Buyer's Guide

Shark hardwood floor cleaners offer powerful solutions for maintaining your floor's finish. Understanding their key features and benefits can help you choose the right machine for your cleaning needs. 


### Power and Suction

Look for a cleaner with adjustable suction power to handle various debris sizes, from fine dust to larger particles. Higher suction capacities are better for deep cleaning but ensure the unit doesn't pull up your floor's finish. 


### Carpet vs. Hardwood Cleaning Nozzles

Most Shark floor cleaners come with interchangeable nozzles designed specifically for hardwood floors. These nozzles prevent scratches and damage that could occur with regular carpet cleaning attachments. 


### Battery Life and Charging

Consider the battery's runtime for single charges, especially if you need to vacuum large areas. Also, check the charging time - models with faster charging options are more convenient for regular use. 


### Additional Features

Some advanced models include features like dust collection systems, extended hoses, and crevice tool attachments. Evaluate whether these extra features match your cleaning habits and space requirements.
