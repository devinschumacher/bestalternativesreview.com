## Buyer's Guide

A Sureflap Microchip Pet Door allows your cat or small dog to enter and exit the home without your assistance, using their unique microchip as identification. This automated pet door combines convenience with security, but several factors will influence your selection, including pet size, climate control needs, and home security considerations. 


### Compatibility with Microchips

Ensure the pet door is compatible with the microchipping system used by your veterinarian. The Sureflap door works with most standard pet microchips, but verify compatibility to avoid purchasing a door that won't function with your specific chip type. 


### Size and Compatibility

Select a pet door that matches your pet's size. The frame should be slightly larger than your pet's body to prevent drafts but small enough to maintain security. The door should also fit your wall thickness; standard options work for 2-inch walls, while thicker walls may require specialized mounting kits. 


### Climate Control Features

Consider pet door models with temperature-controlled flaps. These features prevent drafts while maintaining consistent indoor temperatures, which is crucial for pets with health conditions that require climate control. The door's heating element should activate based on ambient temperature to maintain optimal pet comfort. 


### Security and Energy Efficiency

Look for pet doors with robust security features, such as pet-safe locks that prevent unauthorized entry while allowing your pet to exit. Energy efficiency is also important, especially for year-round climate control. Doors with double-sealed flaps or thermal blankets reduce energy loss while maintaining interior comfort levels. 


## FAQ


### What is a Sureflap Microchip Pet Door?

A Sureflap Microchip Pet Door is a veterinary-grade pet access system that uses microchip technology to control who enters your home. The door features a built-in microchip reader that authenticates compatible microchips, allowing only authorized pets to open the door. 

The system is controlled via a keyless entry pad, which displays messages and has a dedicated pet button for quick access when your pet is nearby. The door remains closed otherwise to prevent unintended openings. 


### How does the Microchip Pet Door work?

The Sureflap Microchip Pet Door uses passive RFID technology to recognize microchips. When the door detects a pet's microchip within range, it activates a motorized mechanism that opens the door. The system works both ways - pets can enter through the microchip reader, and you can open the door remotely using the entry pad. 

The door automatically closes after 1-3 seconds, depending on your setting, and features a robust security lock that requires manual override to open from the outside. This prevents unauthorized access while ensuring your pet can always return home. 


### What pets can use Sureflap Microchip Pet Doors?

The Sureflap system works with any pet that has a compatible microchip, including dogs, cats, and sometimes birds depending on the specific model. Before purchasing, verify that your pet's microchip is recognized by the system and check if the door size matches your pet's breed. 

If you have multiple pets with different microchips, the door can be set to recognize multiple chips. For pets without microchips, the door will remain closed unless manually opened from the entry pad. 


### How is the Microchip Pet Door installed?

The door requires installation by a professional to ensure proper sealing and correct alignment of the motorized components. Installation typically takes 1-2 hours and involves cutting a precise opening in your existing doorframe, mounting the frame, and connecting the electronic components. 

Before installation, measure your doorframe carefully and select the correct size Sureflap kit. The professional installer will need access to power and internet (for some models), and will work with you to choose the right location for the entry pad. 


### What are the main benefits of a Microchip Pet Door?

The Sureflap Microchip Pet Door provides secure, convenient access for authorized pets while keeping your home protected from unauthorized entries. Its microchip authentication system prevents pets without the correct chip from entering, helping to keep your home secure. 

The door also offers improved pet security by ensuring your animals can't escape through an unlocked door. You can monitor pet comings and goings with the activity display on the entry pad, and some models track how often each pet uses the door. 


### How much maintenance does a Microchip Pet Door require?

Regular maintenance for a Sureflap Microchip Pet Door includes checking the battery level in the entry pad, cleaning the microchip reader, and ensuring proper door sealing. Replace the entry pad battery every 2-3 years, and check the motor's brushes annually if your model has them. 

The door itself needs occasional cleaning of both the internal and external surfaces to keep it working smoothly. If your pet has long or oily fur, regular cleaning will help prevent matting or hair buildup on the door mechanics.
