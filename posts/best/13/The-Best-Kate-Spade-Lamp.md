## Buyer's Guide

Lamps from Kate Spade offer both functional lighting and decorative elements for your space. When selecting one, consider the lamp's purpose, style compatibility, bulb options, and build quality to find the perfect piece. 


### Understanding Lamp Functionality

Think about where and how you'll use the lamp. Reading lamps need adjustable brightness, while bedside lamps should minimize glare. Consider whether you need gooseneck options for task lighting or simple table designs for general room illumination.

### Matching Style and Design

Kate Spade lamps come in various styles, from modern to vintage. Measure your space and furniture to ensure the lamp's proportions are right. Consider the finish (brushed nickel, gold, etc. ) and whether it complements your existing decor. 


### Bulb Compatibility and Energy Efficiency

Check the lamp's specifications for bulb compatibility (E26, G25, etc. ). LED bulbs offer longer life and energy efficiency, while traditional incandescent bulbs provide immediate brightness. Factor in your lighting needs and preferences when choosing between options.

### Build Quality and Durability

Examine the lamp's construction materials and craftsmanship. The base should feel stable, and joints should move smoothly without wobble. Consider how often the lamp will be used and whether it needs frequent relocation to determine its durability requirements.
