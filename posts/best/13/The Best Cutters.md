## Buyer's Guide

Cutters, whether handheld or stationary, are essential tools in various industries, from food preparation to construction. Understanding their key features and applications helps in selecting the right tool for specific tasks. 


### Handheld vs. Stationary Cutters

Handheld cutters offer flexibility and portability but may lack the power and precision of stationary models. Stationary cutters provide greater stability and cutting capacity, ideal for heavy-duty tasks but requiring more space and setup time.

### blade type and material

## FAQ

![Cutters-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cutters-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a cutter?

A cutter is a kitchen tool designed for precise cutting tasks, typically featuring a sharp blade that can be rotated or retracted. Common types include pizza cutters, bread knives, and utility cutters. 

These versatile tools help prevent damage to delicate foods and make clean, straight cuts, essential for tasks like slicing tomatoes, cutting cake, or preparing pizza. 


### What are the main types of cutters?

The most common types include pizza cutters, bread knives, utility cutters, and specialty cutters for specific foods like salmon or pineapple. 

Each type is designed with specific features for its intended use, from serrated blades for bread to flexible blades for soft fruits. 

![Cutters-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cutters-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do you choose the right cutter?

Consider the material you'll be cutting, desired blade type (fixed or retractable), and whether you need specialized features like flexible blades or pivoting handles. 

Think about how you'll store the cutter – retractable blades and compact designs are ideal for kitchen drawers. 


### What's the difference between a pizza cutter and a bread knife?

### How should you maintain a cutter?

After each use, clean the blade with mild soap and water, ensuring it's completely dry before storage to prevent rust. 

Store in a dry place, either in its protective sheath or on a magnetic strip in the kitchen to prevent damage to the blade. 


### Can you use a regular knife as a cutter?

While possible, using a regular knife for specific cutting tasks can be less efficient and potentially dangerous. 

Specialized cutters are designed with specific features for their intended use, providing better performance and safety.
