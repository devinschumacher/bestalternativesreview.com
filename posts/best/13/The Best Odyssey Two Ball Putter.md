## Buyer's Guide

The Odyssey Two Ball Putter represents a significant evolution in putter design, combining traditional principles with modern technology. Understanding the key features and considerations when selecting this type of putter will help golfers make an informed choice that aligns with their swing characteristics and personal preferences. 


### Blade vs. Mallet Design

Odyssey Two Ball Putters are available in both blade and mallet styles. Blade designs offer a more traditionally shaped putting surface, while mallet models increase stability through a larger striking area. The choice depends on your comfort with different sight lines and visual references during the stroke.

### Neck Shape and Length

The neck of the putter significantly affects how you hold it and initiate your stroke. Shorter necks promote a straight backstroke, while longer necks can help create a more consistent pendulum motion. The cylindrical neck is designed for a neutral grip, while the D-shaped neck provides more traditional hand positioning. 


### Sole Profile and Weight Distribution

The shape of the putter's sole impacts its stability and performance on various putting surfaces. An upright profile with centralized weight is effective on consistent greens, while an offset sole can help with alignment on undulating surfaces. The heel-to-toe weighting system in Odyssey putters helps maintain stability through the impact zone.

### Alignment Aids and Visual Features

Modern putter designs often incorporate alignment arrows, milled faces, and other visual elements to enhance sight lines. The milling pattern on Odyssey's Two Ball putters can be customized, allowing you to choose between matte, brushed, or high-gloss finishes. These visual cues help golfers maintain proper alignment and focus during their stroke.
