## FAQ


### What is the fragrance like?

Saint by Kat Von D is a complex fragrance that combines spicy, woody, and citrus elements. The top notes feature crisp bergamot and peppery ginger, while the heart notes introduce warm cinnamon and vanilla. The base notes develop into rich patchouli and sandalwood, creating an overall spicy-woody profile with hints of vanilla. 

The fragrance is described as both spicy and warm, with a noticeable ginger presence that gives it a distinct character. While vanilla adds sweetness, the overall effect is more complex than traditional vanilla fragrances, making it suitable for those who prefer fragrances with a distinct character. 


### How long-lasting is the scent?

Saint has decent longevity, lasting 6-8 hours on the skin with moderate sillage (the scent's projection distance). The fragrance's woodsy base notes help it retain its structure longer than some spicy scents, making it suitable for daytime wear. 

While the top notes dissipate quickly, the heart and base notes provide sustained wear. Users with active lifestyles may need to touch up throughout the day, but the fragrance maintains its character without becoming overly strong or overpowering. 


### Is it suitable for different skin types?

Most users report that Saint performs well on various skin types, though sensitivity varies. Those with dry skin may find the fragrance soaks in quickly, while those with oily skin might appreciate its moderate hydration properties. 

Users with sensitive skin should perform a patch test before full application. Synthetic ingredients in the formula may cause irritation for some, particularly those with rosacea or eczema. Those with persistent sensitivities might want to explore alternative options. 


### How does it compare to other Kat Von D fragrances?

Saint shares similarities with other Kat Von D fragrances in its spicy-woody profile, but stands out through its increased complexity. Unlike the more floral and green notes in Vicious, Saint offers a warmer, more enveloping scent experience. 

Compared to Kat Von D's other spicy fragrances like Vicious, Saint feels more sophisticated with its extended vanilla notes. The increased complexity gives it a broader appeal, making it suitable for both casual and formal occasions. 


### What makes it different from other spicy perfumes?

Unlike many spicy perfumes that focus on black pepper or cardamom, Saint incorporates ginger as its primary spicy element. This gives the fragrance a more fresh, invigorating character compared to traditional spicy scents. 

The addition of rich vanilla and warm cinnamon creates a more complex profile than typical spicy fragrances, which often rely on single spicy notes for their character. This complexity allows the fragrance to stand out while maintaining its recognizable category. 


### What are the key ingredients?

The top notes contain bergamot and peppery ginger, immediately creating a fresh and spicy foundation. The heart notes introduce cinnamon and vanilla, adding warmth and sweetness to the mix. 

The base notes feature rich patchouli and sandalwood, providing structure and longevity to the fragrance. Synthetic musks also play a role in extending the wear and creating a more modern interpretation of the classic spicy-woody scent profile.
