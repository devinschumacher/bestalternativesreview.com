### What's included in the kit?

The standard kit includes the drone, remote control, battery charger, spare propellers, and a carrying case. Optional extras like additional batteries and camera accessories are available for purchase. 

You'll need to provide your own microSD card for video and photo storage, and consider a spare battery for extended operations. 


### Any notable drawbacks?

Some users report occasional connection issues between the drone and remote control, particularly in urban environments with high interference. However, these are generally rare and easily resolved by restarting the devices or moving to a different location. 

At 200g, the drone is slightly heavier than some competitors, which can affect portability. However, this extra weight provides better stability during flight, especially in windy conditions.
