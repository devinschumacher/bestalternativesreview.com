The beige tortoise frame adds a touch of warmth to the gradient brown lenses, though some reviewers noted the lenses appear less yellow than expected in person.

### Lens Technology and UV Protection

Modern sunglass lenses incorporate advanced UV protection technologies that block harmful rays while maintaining clear visibility. Look for lenses with broad-spectrum protection rated at 100% UV blockage across all wavelengths. 


### Frame Fit and Comfort

The right frame size and shape should complement your facial structure while providing a secure fit. Consider the temple length and nose bridge design, as these elements significantly impact wearability during various activities.
