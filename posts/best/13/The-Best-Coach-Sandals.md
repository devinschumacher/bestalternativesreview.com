These black Coach flip flops combine a sturdy rubber upper with an EVA footbed for decent arch support. The printed Eva outsole provides some grip, though reviewers note it's not as flexible as traditional rubber flip flops. While the black color adds a modern touch, the signature Coach logo tends to fade quickly after just a few wears. 


## Buyer's Guide

Coach sandals combine style and comfort, making them a popular choice for casual outings and special occasions. These versatile footwear options come in various designs, materials, and color combinations. Understanding key aspects of coach sandals will help you select a pair that matches your preferences and needs. 


### Materials and Construction

Construction quality varies among coach sandals. Higher-quality models often feature genuine leather uppers with reinforced stitching and non-slip outsoles. Consider the material composition: full-grain leather provides durability, while synthetic alternatives offer affordability and water-resistance. The sandal's build quality, including the stability of the heel support and flexibility of the footbed, affects both comfort and longevity. 


### Style and Design Elements

Sandal designs range from minimalist to ornate, with options for both low and high heel heights. Key design considerations include the strap configuration for foot security, the presence of decorative elements like beads or embroidery, and the closure type (strap wraps, hook-and-loop closures, or ankle straps). The design should complement your personal style while providing adequate support for your foot shape. 


### Comfort Features

Top-quality coach sandals incorporate comfort-enhancing elements such as cushioned insoles, arch support, and adjustable straps. Consider the sandal's width, as roomy styles prevent hotspots and pressure points. Heavier padding around the heel can reduce fatigue during extended wear, but it may not be suitable for those who prefer minimal cushioning. 


### Fit and Sizing

Coach sandals typically run true to size, but some styles may need half-size adjustments. It's essential to measure your feet and consider arch height when selecting a fit. Trial different styles to find the best-width match, as some designs naturally accommodate wider feet better than others. Properly fitting sandals allow for natural foot movement while preventing slippage or tightness during wear.
