## Buyer's Guide

Color Wow Root Cover Up offers several formulas to conceal grey roots between touch-ups. The product range includes developer-based options for fuller coverage and non-developer formulas for lighter greys. 


### Formula Options

Developer formulas contain peroxide to accelerate grey hair color lift, while non-developer options work with existing hair color. Choose based on the severity of your grey and your next touch-up schedule. 


### Application Techniques

Apply the product to clean, dry hair, focusing on roots with a small brush or makeup sponge. Work in sections, starting at the scalp and blending outward. Use a colorless toner to neutralize brassiness after application. 


### Color Considerations

Select a shade that matches your permanent hair color as closely as possible. The product can lift 1-2 shades, so choose a color one shade darker than your roots to prevent patchy results. 


### Aftercare

After the root cover up dries, shampoo as usual. Protect your colored hair with heat protectant when styling and use a clarifying shampoo monthly to remove product buildup. 


## FAQ


### What is Color Wow Root Cover Up?

Color Wow Root Cover Up is a precision-root touch-up solution that helps extend the life of hair color between salon visits. It's designed to conceal freshly grown-out roots and maintain a consistent color tone throughout the hair length. 

Unlike regular hair color, Root Cover Up requires only small, targeted applications at the roots, making it ideal for touch-ups between salon visits. Each bottle contains enough product for multiple applications, with each application lasting approximately 3-4 weeks. 


### How long does each Root Cover Up application last?

Each application of Color Wow Root Cover Up typically lasts 3-4 weeks, depending on the growth rate of your hair and the extent of your root regrowth. For optimal results, it's recommended to apply before your hair reaches 1/2 inch of regrowth. 

The product works best when applied to freshly washed, slightly damp hair. This helps the color adhere more effectively to the hair shaft, resulting in a more vibrant and natural-looking finish. 


### Can Root Cover Up be used on all hair types?

Color Wow Root Cover Up is suitable for all hair types, including fine, thick, curly, and straight hair. It's important to note that the product is only designed for root touch-ups and should not be used to color the entire head of hair. 

If you have previously used bleach or other hair lightening products, you may need to use a different formula. Color Wow offers a specific Lightener Formula for pre-lightened hair, which should be used instead of the regular Root Cover Up. 


### What shades are available for Root Cover Up?

The Color Wow Root Cover Up system includes three core colors: Lightener, Brown, and Red. These formulas can be mixed and customized to achieve specific shades and tone corrections for both natural and chemically treated hair. 

Each Core Formula comes with multiple Correction Shaders, allowing you to fine-tune the color to match your specific hair tone. The system also includes a Concealant for neutralizing unwanted tones and a Highlighting Mist for adding extra dimension to your roots. 


### How is Root Cover Up applied?

To apply Color Wow Root Cover Up, start by sectioning your hair and covering the scalp with disposable caps to protect your clothes and keep product out of your eyes. Apply a small amount of the appropriate Core Formula to a section of your roots, focusing on the mid-lengths and ends where the color appears naturally. 

Use a fine-tooth comb to distribute the product evenly through the hair, paying extra attention to any uneven regrowth or lighter areas at the scalp. Leave the product on for 30-45 minutes, then rinse thoroughly and follow with your regular shampoo and conditioner routine. 


### Are there any potential side effects?

Color Wow Root Cover Up is formulated with natural ingredients and is generally well-tolerated. However, like any hair color product, it's possible to experience mild irritation or sensitivity, especially if you have previously had adverse reactions to hair color products. 

If you experience itching, redness, or any unusual discomfort after application, discontinue use and thoroughly wash your hair. If symptoms persist, consult a dermatologist. Always perform a patch test before using any new hair color product.
