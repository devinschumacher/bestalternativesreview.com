## Buyer's Guide

Aquaphor moisturizers combine healing properties with intense hydration, making them a popular choice for various skin concerns. This guide helps you understand the key features and considerations when selecting an Aquaphor product. 


### Active Ingredients

Look for Aquaphor's signature ingredients, including petrolatum and zinc oxide. These create a protective barrier while allowing skin to breathe. Consider additional ingredients for specific needs, such as urea for dry skin or hydrocortisone for irritation. 


### Formulations

Choose between plain Aquaphor, Advanced Repair, or Sensitive Skin formulas. Plain Aquaphor offers broad protection, Advanced Repair targets severely dry skin, and Sensitive Skin provides gentle hydration for delicate areas. 


### Application and Texture

Plain Aquaphor has a thicker consistency, while Advanced Repair has enhanced spreadability. Opt for the texture that matches your comfort level and application method. The Sensitive Skin formula has a lighter consistency for everyday use. 


### Storage and Shelf Life

Store Aquaphor in a cool, dry place to maintain its effectiveness. Check for signs of oxidation (white residue) before use. The product typically has a shelf life of 1-2 years when properly stored. 


## FAQ


### What conditions can Aquaphor moisturizer help with?

Aquaphor is effective for diverse skin issues, including eczema, psoriasis, and diaper rash. Its protective barrier helps heal minor cuts, burns, and abrasions, while also soothing chapped lips and hands. 

The product's unique formula provides long-lasting moisture without greasiness, making it suitable for sensitive skin types. It's particularly beneficial during dry winter months or in low-humidity environments. 


### How should I apply Aquaphor moisturizer?

For general use, apply a small amount to clean, dry skin and massage until fully absorbed. For dry patches or specific skin issues, use a thicker layer and allow it to sit for a few minutes before gentle absorption. 

For sensitive areas like mucous membranes, apply with clean fingers or a cotton swab, avoiding direct contact with the affected area to reduce irritation. 


### Is Aquaphor moisturizer safe for babies?

Yes, Aquaphor is gentle enough for infants and babies. It's commonly used for diaper rash, cuts, and general skin protection due to its soothing properties and non-irritating formula. 

Always perform a patch test on a small area of skin before applying to break, sensitive, or affected areas to ensure no adverse reactions occur. 


### Can I use Aquaphor moisturizer with other products?

In most cases, Aquaphor can be used with other skincare products. Apply it after cleanser and toner, but before heavy or occlusive products like oils or sunscreens for optimal absorption. 

Avoid direct application over active acne treatments or powerful exfoliants, as the barrier properties may reduce their effectiveness. Always test new products separately to prevent potential interactions. 


### How long does Aquaphor moisturizer typically last?

When stored properly in a cool, dry place, an unopened jar of Aquaphor typically lasts 2-3 years from the manufacture date. Opened jars usually remain effective for 3-6 months if used within 6 weeks of opening. 

Always check for any changes in color, texture, or odor before use, as slight changes may indicate the product has gone bad. Replace any product showing signs of deterioration. 


### What makes Aquaphor different from other moisturizers?

Aquaphor's distinctive characteristic is its ability to form a protective barrier on the skin's surface, helping prevent moisture loss while promoting healing. This makes it particularly suitable for dry or damaged skin. 

Unlike many other moisturizers that primarily focus on hydration, Aquaphor incorporates unique components like petrolatum and mineral oil which create a physical barrier that helps the skin heal and repair itself.
