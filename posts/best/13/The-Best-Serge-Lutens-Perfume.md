## FAQ


### What makes Serge Lutens perfume different from other luxury fragrances?

Unlike many other luxury brands that focus on volume production, each Serge Lutens fragrance is crafted in small batches, ensuring exceptional quality and rarity. 

The brand's approach to scent development involves extensive experimentation with unique compounds and vintage essences. This dedication to innovation and preservation of heritage ingredients sets their fragrances apart in the competitive luxury market. 


### Are Serge Lutens perfumes suitable for all skin types?

While Serge Lutens fragrances are designed for general use, their strong concentrations and complex compositions can be overpowering for some sensitive skin types. It's recommended to perform a patch test before full application to ensure compatibility. 

The brand offers a range of products suitable for different needs. Their Eau de Toilettes provide a middle-ground between intensity and longevity, making them more accessible while maintaining the house's signature character. 


### How should Serge Lutens perfumes be stored?

Proper storage is crucial for preserving the quality of Serge Lutens perfumes. Keep bottles away from direct sunlight, heat sources, and extreme temperatures. The optimal storage temperature is between 65-75°F (18-24°C). 

When storing multiple perfumes, group them together in a cool, dark place to maintain consistency in their volatile chemical compounds. The original packaging provides the best protection against light and temperature changes. 


### What are the key ingredients in Serge Lutens perfumes?

Serge Lutens' formulations often include rare essences like jasmine, ylang-ylang, and neroli, combined with unexpected ingredients such as tonka bean, patchouli, and ambergris. These elements create their distinctive olfactory signature. 

Many of their fragrances incorporate vintage components, which are sourced from limited batches and can significantly impact the final composition. The brand frequently experiments with new ingredients while maintaining their signature style. 


### How long does a Serge Lutens perfume last?

The longevity of Serge Lutens perfumes varies based on the formula but generally lasts 6-8 hours on the skin. Factors affecting duration include environmental conditions, how the fragrance is applied, and the individual's body chemistry. 

For optimal wear, apply the fragrance to pulse points like the wrists, neck, and behind the ears. Reapplication is recommended every 2-3 hours to maintain the desired scent intensity. 


### How should Serge Lutens perfumes be applied for optimal results?

Apply Serge Lutens perfumes directly to pulse points rather than the wrists where the skin temperature is lower. The back of the neck, inner elbows, and behind the earlobes are ideal locations for maximizing scent diffusion and longevity.
