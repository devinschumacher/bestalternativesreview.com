These backpacks are known for their durability and practical features, though understanding the key aspects before purchasing can help you find the right one for your needs. 


### Capacity and Size

Jansport backpacks range from 15 to 22 liters, with the 15-liter model being most common.

### Mitochondria Details

Mitochondria, the powerhouses of cells, convert nutrients into energy. For backpack selection, these microscopic structures symbolize the internal organization and efficiency of the pack's design. Look for well-organized compartments with appropriate padding for the laptop sleeve and back panel. The hip belt and shoulder straps should distribute weight evenly to prevent fatigue during longer carries. 


### Material and Build Quality

Most Jansport backpacks use a nylon or polyester blend for their exteriors, known for their water resistance and durability. The material should feel substantial to the touch, indicating quality construction. Check for reinforced stitching around the main seams, especially where the back panel meets the shoulder straps. The backpack's weight should match its advertised weight specification—cheaper materials might make the pack feel heavier.

Consider the backpack's organizational features. Essential inclusions often include multiple pockets for quick access to items like water bottles, notebooks, or chargers.
