## FAQ

### What is a desk topper?

A desk topper is a protective cover that fits over your computer keyboard and mouse. It's designed to prevent damage from dust, spills, and general wear and tear, extending the life of your input devices. 

Most desk toppers come with a built-in wrist rest to support your hands while typing, though some models offer additional features like wrist guards or gel padding for extra comfort. 


### How do desk toppers work?

These covers protect your keyboard and mouse by creating a barrier between your devices and potential hazards. The protective layer also helps prevent direct contact with abrasive materials like mousepads or desk surfaces. 

Some advanced models include anti-static properties to reduce buildup and special coatings to resist stains and moisture. The cover itself usually has a non-slip base to keep your devices in place.

### What materials are desk toppers made from?

The most common materials are TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane), PVC (polyvinyl chloride), and rubber. Each material offers different levels of protection and durability. 

TPU is known for its flexibility and transparency, making it a popular choice for users who want to see their keyboard. PVC covers are heavier and provide better protection against spills but can be less flexible. 


### How do you install a desk topper?

Most desk toppers have snap-on or magnetic edges that fit snugly over your keyboard and mouse. Some models may require you to remove the keys first, while others come with key covers. 

The installation process typically takes less than 10 minutes. Make sure to clean your keyboard and mouse thoroughly before installation to prevent debris from getting trapped under the cover.

### How long do desk toppers last?

With regular use, a quality desk topper can last 2-3 years before showing signs of wear. Factors affecting longevity include usage frequency, material quality, and maintenance. 

Some users report longer lifespans with proper care, while others may need to replace their cover more frequently. Signs that indicate it's time to replace your topper include visible scratches, fraying edges, or reduced protection. 


### Can desk toppers be cleaned?

Yes, most desk toppers are machine washable. For daily cleaning, you can use a slightly damp cloth with mild soap and water. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners that could damage the material. 

Always make sure the cover is completely dry before reinstalling it on your keyboard and mouse to prevent water damage. Some models suggest using a hairdryer on cool settings to speed up the drying process.
