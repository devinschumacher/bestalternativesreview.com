### Are adjustable legs standard on 63-inch desks?

While not universal, many 63-inch desks offer adjustable legs for leveling and stability. Some models feature built-in extenders for increased height. 

Leg adjustments typically range between 1-3 inches, allowing slight modification to the desk's height. 


### What storage options should I consider?

Dual-shelf models provide the most storage, though single-shelf designs with drawers underneath offer organized space for files and accessories. 

Consider designs that maximize vertical space, as this often translates to increased storage capacity. 


### What maintenance requirements do 63-inch desks have?

Regular cleaning with a damp cloth and mild detergent maintains the desk's finish. Avoid harsh chemicals that can damage melamine surfaces. 

Check adjustable legs periodically for proper positioning and ensure cable channels remain clear of debris.
