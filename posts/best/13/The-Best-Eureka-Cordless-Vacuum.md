## Buyer's Guide

Eureka's cordless vacuum cleaners offer versatility and convenience, combining powerful suction with portable design. These vacuums use rechargeable batteries for operation, eliminating the need for cords while maintaining comparable cleaning performance to their corded counterparts. 


### Power Source and Battery Life

Cordless vacuums depend on battery efficiency, with multiple factors affecting runtime. Lithium-ion batteries provide longer-lasting power compared to older nickel-based alternatives. Look for vacuums with good power-to-weight ratio - capable of sustained suction without excessive bulk. Some models offer quick charging options, while others maintain consistent performance throughout their battery cycle. 


### Attachments and Accessibility

The right attachments can transform a basic vacuum into a versatile cleaning tool. Eureka models often include crevice tools, dusting brushes, and motorized brushes for different cleaning needs. Consider the ease of attachment changes and tool storage options. The vacuum should reach tight spaces and high locations with minimal effort. 


### Performance and Suction Power

Suction power is crucial for effective cleaning, particularly in detecting improvements between cordless models. Look for systems with adjustable suction settings or multiple power levels. Filter efficiency affects both cleaning performance and air quality, with HEPA filters offering the highest standard. 


### Maintenance and Long-term Cost

Regular maintenance extends a vacuum's lifespan and keeps performance consistent. Consider how easy it is to access filter systems, empty dust containers, and clean components. Some models require professional servicing, while others have simpler maintenance routines. Initial cost should be weighed against expected usage frequency and local service availability.
