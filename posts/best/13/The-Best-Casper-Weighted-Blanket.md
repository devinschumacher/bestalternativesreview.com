## Buyer's Guide

A Casper weighted blanket combines the comfort of traditional weighted blankets with the quality standards of the Casper brand. These blankets use specialty glass beads that provide deep pressure stimulation, helping to promote relaxation and improve sleep quality. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select a blanket that meets your needs and preferences. 


### Weight and Size Options

Casper offers blankets in various sizes and weight options to accommodate different body types and comfort levels. Common weights range from 5 to 20 pounds, while sizes typically include single (65" x 85"), double (65" x 90"), and twin (75" x 90") options. The company recommends selecting a blanket that is about 10% of your body weight to achieve optimal therapeutic benefits while ensuring comfort during sleep. 


### Materials and Construction

The blankets feature a soft, machine-washable outer shell made from materials like cotton or a blend with moisture-wicking properties. The inner core contains glass beads encased in a breathable mesh layer, which prevents bead shifting and ensures even distribution. Look for blankets that include quality construction features like reinforced stitching and secure closures to ensure longevity and safety. 


### Comfort Features

Modern Casper weighted blankets incorporate thoughtful design elements for enhanced comfort. These may include multiple tension points to adjust the blanket's snugness, built-in neck pillows, and edge-free designs that prevent bumping into the blanket's corners during sleep. Consider these features when selecting a blanket to maximize your nighttime comfort. 


### Care and Maintenance

Proper care of your weighted blanket is crucial for maintaining its effectiveness and extending its lifespan. Most blankets require regular cleaning, typically every 3-6 months, using the outer shell's recommended care instructions. Avoid direct sunlight and extreme temperatures, as these can damage the blanket's materials. Proper storage techniques, such as rolling rather than folding and keeping away from moisture, will help preserve your weighted blanket's quality. 


## FAQ


### What is a weighted blanket?

A weighted blanket is a type of blanket that contains evenly distributed pellets or beads to create a gentle pressure across the body. This pressure, also known as deep pressure stimulation, can help promote relaxation, reduce anxiety, and improve sleep quality. 

The weight is typically between 5-20% of the user's body weight and is distributed through multiple pockets across the blanket. Standard sizes include twin, double, and king, with weights ranging from 15 to 45 pounds. 


### What makes the Casper Weighted Blanket unique?

The Casper Weighted Blanket features a premium, machine-washable cover made from their signature cotton-terry material. It includes a durable, double-stitched weighted insert that contains steel balls instead of the typical glass beads found in many weighted blankets. 

The blanket comes in six calming colors and offers two weight options: 20 pounds for single beds and 30 pounds for king-sized beds. Each weight pocket contains steel balls, providing a consistent pressure distribution and preventing lumps or shifts in weight. 


### How do I clean the Casper Weighted Blanket?

The outer cotton-terry cover is machine washable and dryer safe. We recommend using a gentle detergent and a mild cycle to prevent damage to the weighted insert. The cover should be turned inside out before washing and air-dried to maintain its shape and integrity. 

For maintenance of the weighted insert, spot clean spills immediately using a dry cloth. Avoid submerging the steel balls in water, as this could damage the covering material or the steel itself. Regular cleaning of the outer cover is recommended to maintain hygiene and extend the blanket's lifespan. 


### How much should I weigh for a properly weighted blanket?

The recommended weight range for a weighted blanket is between 5-20% of your body weight. For example, a 150-pound person would typically use a 15-pound blanket, while a 200-pound person would use a 20-pound blanket. Some people prefer lighter or heavier blankets based on their specific needs and preferences. 

If you're unsure about the appropriate weight, consult a healthcare professional or the blanket manufacturer's guidelines. They can help determine the best weight based on your sleep habits, stress levels, and specific health considerations. 


### What are the benefits of weighted blankets?

Weighted blankets can help reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, and ADHD by providing deep pressure stimulation through their evenly distributed weight. This pressure triggers the release of serotonin and dopamine, helping to create a calming effect and improve mood. 

Many users report improved sleep quality, including deeper and more restful sleep. The consistent pressure can help regulate body temperature, promote relaxation, and reduce tossing and turning during the night. 


### Are weighted blankets safe for all ages?

Weighted blankets are generally safe for adults and children over the age of 10, weighing at least 30 pounds. The recommended weight range for children is typically 10-20% of their body weight. 

It's important to supervise younger children when using a weighted blanket and ensure it's properly placed to prevent blankets from becoming trapped over the head or extremities. Always check the blanket's weight and size recommendations before use.
