## Buyer's Guide

Live edge side tables combine natural wood beauty with practical functionality, making them a popular choice for contemporary interiors. These thoughtfully designed pieces accentuate the character of raw timber while serving as stylish storage solutions or decorative focal points in any room. 


### Key Features to Consider

The natural irregularities of live edge wood result in unique table designs. Look for consistent measurements across your desired length and height to ensure proper placement and balance. Common sizes range from compact 18-24 inches wide for narrow spaces to generous 42-60 inches for statement pieces. 


### Maintenance Requirements

Timber's natural porous surface requires regular care to prevent damage from spills and scratches. Opt for sealants that complement your wood's grain pattern and level of finish (satin, high gloss, matte). Consider the table's intended use and location when selecting maintenance products to ensure compatibility with the environment. 


### Construction Quality

A solid wood core with proper joint construction ensures longevity. Verify that the table legs and supporting structure are securely attached and stable under weight. High-quality craftsmanship eliminates wobbles and maintains even surface levels across the top panel. 


### Size and Placement

Measure your space carefully before selecting a table size, considering both horizontal span and vertical height. Standard room clearance requirements suggest allowing 18-24 inches between tables and seating for comfortable movement. Evaluate the room's architectural elements like windows, doorways, and furniture placement when positioning your new live edge side table. 


## FAQ


### What is a live edge side table?

A live edge side table features a natural, rough-hewn edge of the wood rather than a smooth, finished surface. This unique design element brings a rustic, raw aesthetic to modern interiors. 

The term "live edge" comes from traditional woodworking and furniture making, where leaving natural wood features like branch patterns and bark intact adds character and authenticity to the piece. 


### What types of wood are commonly used for live edge side tables?

Live edge side tables often feature hardwoods such as oak, walnut, cherry, and maple. These woods are chosen for their durability and natural beauty. 

Less common materials include bamboo, reclaimed wood, and engineered wood, which allow for larger table sizes or unique grain patterns. 


### How should live edge side tables be maintained?

Regular cleaning with a soft cloth and mild soap helps maintain the wood's natural finish. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive materials that can damage the wood's surface. 

Sealing the wood with a high-quality furniture oil or wax can protect it from scratches and stains, while maintaining its natural look. 


### What size variations are available for live edge side tables?

Standard live edge side tables typically range from 18 to 24 inches in height, with widths between 24 and 36 inches. This allows them to sit flush against walls while providing enough space for a lamp or decorative objects. 

Larger sizes can be custom-built to fit specific spaces or needs, making them suitable for both small and large rooms. 


### How should live edge side tables be positioned in a room?

These tables work well as accent pieces in living rooms, bedrooms, or offices. Place them against walls or near seating areas to maximize their visual impact. 

They also function well in pairs or multiples, creating a striking focal point while providing useful surface space. 


### What are the main benefits of live edge side tables?

The unique natural look of live edge tables adds visual interest and character to any room, making them a distinctive choice for modern interiors. 

These tables typically offer better value than similar-sized furniture pieces due to their handcrafted nature and use of natural materials.
