### Capacity and Size

Arcteryx offers backpacks ranging from 25 to 65 liters. For day hikes, a 25-30 liter pack typically suffices. Multi-day trips require larger 40-60 liter options. Consider the specific dimensions: taller backpacks may improve posture but take up extra space.

### How do Arcteryx's ultralight backpacks differ from their standard hiking models?

Ultralight backpacks use the same precision engineering but focus on extreme weight reduction. Common upgrades include ultra-thin fabrics, removed waist pads, and simplified closures. These backpacks are designed for backpacking racers and those who prioritize weight over every feature. 

While sacrificing some comfort and functionality, ultralight models offer significant weight savings through strategic material and design choices. 


### What customization options are available for Arcteryx backpacks?

Many Arcteryx backpacks offer a wide range of customization options through modular attachment points, interchangeable components, and adjustable features. The popular Alpha and Saga series allow you to modify the pack's volume and configuration based on your specific needs.
