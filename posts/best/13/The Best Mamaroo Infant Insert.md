## FAQ


### What is the Mamaroo Infant Insert?

The Mamaroo Infant Insert is a specialized sleep accessory designed for infants under 12 months old. It fits into standard bassinets and cribs, providing a raised sleeping surface that helps prevent flat spots on baby's head while allowing them to sleep in a more natural, slightly upright position. 

The insert features a contoured, ergonomic design that supports a baby's head, neck, and spine, with a built-in ventilation system to keep the sleeping area cool and comfortable. It's made from breathable, hypoallergenic materials to reduce the risk of overheating during sleep. 


### How does the Mamaroo Infant Insert prevent flat spots?

The raised sleeping surface of the Mamaroo Infant Insert helps distribute pressure more evenly across a baby's head, reducing the risk of plagiocephaly (flat spots) that can develop from lying flat for extended periods. By keeping the head slightly elevated, it allows for improved circulation and natural head shape development. 

Parents should still follow the American Academy of Pediatrics' recommendation to frequently change the baby's sleep position to prevent flat spots, but the Mamaroo insert provides an additional layer of protection during nap time and nighttime sleep. 


### Is the Mamaroo Infant Insert suitable for all infants?

The Mamaroo Infant Insert is designed for healthy infants between 6-12 months old who can sit up independently. It's not recommended for younger babies who cannot support their head and neck in a semi-upright position. Always consult your pediatrician before using any sleep accessory. 

While it's suitable for most infants, some babies with specific medical conditions may need alternative sleep solutions. Parents should monitor their baby's comfort and adjust the insert's position as needed to ensure proper support. 


### How do I clean and maintain the Mamaroo Infant Insert?

The Mamaroo Infant Insert can be machine washed in a mesh bag on a gentle cycle with mild detergent. It's important to check the care instructions for specific requirements, as some models may include removable covers that need separate washing. 

Regular cleaning is essential to maintain hygiene and prevent odor build-up. After washing, allow the insert to air dry completely before use to prevent moisture-related issues that could affect your baby's sleep quality. 


### Can the Mamaroo Infant Insert be used with other baby products?

The Mamaroo Infant Insert fits into standard bassinets and cribs with 22-inch (56 cm) sides. It's compatible with most mattress sizes but may not fit correctly in bassinets with higher sides. Always check the manufacturer's guidelines for proper fit and positioning. 

The insert works well with other sleep accessories like swaddling blankets and sleep positioning pillows. However, it's important to avoid using additional cushions or pillows that could obstruct your baby's airway or create unsafe sleep conditions. 


### How long does the Mamaroo Infant Insert last?

The lifespan of a Mamaroo Infant Insert depends on regular cleaning and proper use. With regular upkeep, the insert can last 1-2 years before needing replacement. Signs that indicate it's time for a new insert include excessive wear and tear, odor development, or changes in the padding's firmness. 

Parents should consider replacing the insert if their baby outgrows the recommended age range or if the product shows signs of damage. The insert's durability can vary based on usage frequency and the quality of care it receives.
