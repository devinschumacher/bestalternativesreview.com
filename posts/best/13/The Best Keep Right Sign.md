## Buyer's Guide

Signage is crucial for guiding traffic and ensuring safety on roads. A keep right sign specifically directs vehicles to stay in their lane, especially helpful on multi-lane highways and busy intersections. Understanding the key aspects of these signs will help you select the right size, visibility, and durability for your specific location. 


### Size Specifications

Standard keep right signs measure 30 inches by 48 inches. Larger sizes may be necessary for high-speed areas or when placed where vehicles are traveling faster. Always check local regulations for minimum sign dimensions. 


### Material and Durability

These signs typically use extruded or injected alphanumeric panels with impact-resistant backing. Consider factors like exposure to weather elements and vehicle impacts when selecting material specifications. Local codes may dictate minimum durability standards. 


### Visibility and Contrast

High visibility is essential for traffic control. Signs should have a white background with black letters. The legend "KEEP RIGHT" appears in white capital letters on the right half of the sign. Proper contrast enhances readability from a distance. 


### Installation Requirements

Sign posts should be concrete-filled with a base width matching the sign's dimensions. The sign should lean slightly toward the roadway at a 2% angle. Observe local installation standards and consider weight limits for your location. 


## FAQ


### What are Keep Right Signs used for?

Keep Right Signs are regulatory traffic signs used to direct road users to maintain their lane position and not cross into adjacent lanes. These signs are essential for maintaining orderly traffic flow and ensuring safe navigation through narrow or divided roadways. 

They are typically placed before the point where multiple lanes converge into a single lane, indicating to drivers that they must stay in their current lane to continue their journey. The signs help prevent traffic jams, reduce the likelihood of accidents, and ensure that vehicles traveling at different speeds can coexist safely on the same road. 


### What materials are Keep Right Signs made from?

Modern Keep Right Signs are commonly made from high-strength aluminum composite materials. These durable panels combine aluminum sheets with polyethylene cores, providing excellent weather resistance and longevity in outdoor environments. 

Alternatively, some signs use steel backed with plastic laminates, which offers good durability at a lower cost. Reflective materials are applied to the front of the sign to ensure visibility during nighttime and poor weather conditions. All sign faces meet local standards for visibility and reflectivity. 


### How should Keep Right Signs be mounted?

Keep Right Signs can be mounted on portable bases for temporary installations or on fixed structures like poles or walls. For ground-mounted poles, they should be positioned at least 20 feet apart to ensure clear visibility to approaching drivers. 

The sign should be mounted with the "KEEP RIGHT" message facing the direction of traffic flow. On curved roads or where multiple lanes converge, additional signs may be required to ensure all drivers receive the correct information. 


### What size options are available for Keep Right Signs?

Standard Keep Right Signs measure 30 inches by 24 inches (76 cm by 61 cm), which is the minimum size required to convey the regulation effectively. This size includes the border and is suitable for most roadways and parking lots. 

For heavy traffic areas or when mounted behind other signs, larger versions measuring 48 inches by 36 inches (122 cm by 91 cm) may be available. The larger size provides better visibility from a distance and can help overcome visual clutter in complex traffic environments. 


### What are the legal requirements for using Keep Right Signs?

Keep Right Signs must meet specific legal standards set by local traffic authorities and highway departments. These standards cover sign size, material durability, reflectivity requirements, and mounting specifications. 

Local regulations may also specify where these signs can be placed and what other traffic control devices should be used in conjunction with them. Installation requires approval from the appropriate authorities to ensure compliance with both local and national traffic regulations. 


### How do I maintain a Keep Right Sign?

Regular inspection of Keep Right Signs is essential to maintain their effectiveness. Check for any damage to the sign face, damage to mounting hardware, or signs that have shifted position. 

Reflective materials should be cleaned with mild soap and water, ensuring the sign remains visible at night. For aluminum signs, touching up any chipped paint can extend the sign's lifespan. Immediately address any issues that could compromise visibility or safety.
