## Buyer's Guide

Gebhardt Chili Powder comes in various strengths, from mild to extra hot, allowing you to customize your recipe's heat level. The primary ingredient should be chilies, with other spices like cumin and garlic often included in flavor blends. High-quality powders use minimal processing, preserving the chilies' fresh-picked flavor and aroma. 


### Heat Level

Choose based on your tolerance for spiciness. Mild options range from 1,000 to 4,000 Scoville units, while extra hot varieties exceed 30,000 Scoville units. The heat source is typically a combination of dried chilies and sometimes cayenne pepper. 


### Storage

Store unopened containers in a cool, dark place for up to two years. Once opened, transfer powder to an airtight container and keep it in a dry place for six months to a year. Proper storage prevents moisture absorption, which can degrade both the spice's quality and shelf life. 


### Substitutes

To achieve similar heat profiles, consider Ancho Chili Powder (mild), Chipotle Powder (medium), or Cayenne Pepper (very hot). Adjust the amount used based on personal preference and the specific recipe requirements. 


### Blends and Additives

Ingredients beyond chili powder can affect both flavor and heat. Look for products with simple, ingredient lists when seeking the purest form. Some varieties include oregano, paprika, or vinegar for additional depth, which can influence the spice's character. 


## FAQ


### Where can I find Gebhardt chili powder?

Gebhardt chili powders are available at major grocery stores, including Walmart, Target, and Publix, as well as online retailers like Amazon and the Gebhardt official website. Check the international website for specific availability in your country. 

While smaller specialty stores might not carry Gebhardt, you can often find it in ethnic markets or request it through local grocery store ordering services. 


### What types of Gebhardt chili powder are there?

Gebhardt offers several varieties including mild, medium, and hot chili powders. Their most popular options are the Whole Pepper and Pure Powder chili flakes, which come in both mild and hot versions. 

Each type has slightly different characteristics - the whole peppers are coarser and have a bit of texture, while the pure powder is finer and more consistent in its heat distribution. 


### How should I store Gebhardt chili powder?

Store Gebhardt chili powders in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. The sealed pouches provided are designed for freshness, but transferring them to a container with a tight lid will prevent any potential leaks. 

Avoid storing chili powders in the refrigerator or freezer, as moisture can affect the quality of the spice. The packets remain good for about 6 months after opening. 


### How do I use Gebhardt chili powder?

Use Gebhardt chili powder sparingly at first, as it's very potent. Start with a small amount and adjust to taste. It works well in chili, soups, stews, and anywhere you'd use ground cayenne pepper. 

You can substitute it for other chili powders in recipes, but note that Gebhardt tends to be slightly milder. Adjust the amount based on your desired level of heat. 


### What's the difference between Gebhardt and regular chili powder?

Gebhardt chili powders are typically milder than traditional chili powders, which often contain added spices like cumin and oregano. Gebhardt's primary ingredient is cayenne pepper, making it more dedicated to chili flavor. 

While some regular chili powders are mild, Gebhardt's offerings are consistently less spicy than most store-bought options, making them a good choice if you're sensitive to heat. 


### Can I make my own Gebhardt chili powder?

While you can blend your own chili powder using cayenne peppers, the store-bought Gebhardt version offers superior consistency and controlled heat levels. The company's specialty is in processing and packaging the chili flakes for optimal flavor and shelf life. 

For personal use, you can create a similar blend by mixing 75% cayenne pepper with 25% smoked paprika. This combination closely approximates Gebhardt's Whole Pepper variety.
