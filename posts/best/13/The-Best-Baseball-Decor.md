This adorable baseball-themed night light brings a cozy glow to any bedroom with its 3D visual effects and 16-color display. At just 3.35 inches tall, the unobtrusive design fits perfectly on a nightstand or floor. The USB-powered lamp uses three AA batteries (not included) and features smooth dimming control for just the right amount of nighttime illumination. 


### [MLB 3D Stadium Wall Art: New York Yankees](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Baseball+Decor?utm\_term=mlb-3d-stadium-wall-art-new-york-yankees)

![MLB 3D Stadium Wall Art: New York Yankees | Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcTHv099kvSCJ9JmfBF\_tdcG8mklth9ZKtG8\_bKz43QW7r-QDV1q&usqp=CAY)

The handcrafted wall art is made from 25 layers of engineered wood with a coffee bean colored MDF frame, measuring 25.5 inches in length by 19.5 inches in height. Each panel is three inches deep, creating a unique 3D effect. The officially licensed piece comes ready to hang with included hardware, making it a practical addition to any fan's collection. 


### [Oakland Athletics Faux Barrel Top Sign](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Baseball+Decor?utm\_term=oakland-athletics-faux-barrel-top-sign)

![Oakland Athletics Faux Barrel Top Sign | Image](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcRVY7qZBvz1U3EJBFnktv2ficAz6qJ3gAki19MInqalw3AXW305awh8lXR1I7Y3nRtX0DFL5b9nuZXAyQUgYcsoROTYJx8\_Xw&usqp=CAY)

The wall sign captures the classic barrel-top design but makes it more manageable at 20 inches square. The brown frame looks richly appointed after the hand-staining process, though it's plastic underneath. The keyhole mount makes hanging a breeze, and while it's not as expensive as real wood, you'd never know it's not the genuine article until you saw the price tag.

## Buyer's Guide

Decorating with baseball memorabilia can transform any room into a sports haven. Whether you're a die-hard fan or just love the game, these carefully selected pieces can enhance your living space. From classic jerseys to vintage bats, understand what makes each item special and how to display it properly. 


### Baseball Jerseys

Jerseys range from vintage team uniforms to modern retro designs. Look for authentic details like team logos and numbers. Vintage items in original packaging are preferable, though condition is more important than rarity. Modern jerseys should match your style – casual or dressy. 


### Vintage Bats

Real wood bats increase in value with age and condition. Professional game-used bats fetch the highest prices. For display, choose bats with clear provenance if possible. Consider resting bats on stands rather than hanging them to prevent damage from dust and chemicals in the air. 


### GameTickets and Programs

Authentic tickets and programs from memorable games hold significant value. Look for events featuring famous players or historic moments. While programs are more common, tickets generally appreciate more in value. Store these items in acid-free folders to protect the paper. 


### Game-Worn Gloves

Professional game-gloved collections are highly sought after. Look for items with serial numbers or official documentation verifying their use. Condition is crucial – wear patterns and stitching integrity affect value. Display gloves separately to prevent damage from environmental factors.
