## Buyer's Guide

Dyson fans combine powerful air circulation with sleek design, making them a popular choice for both home and office environments. When selecting a Dyson fan, consider several key factors to find the right model for your space and needs. 


### Size and Space Requirements

Measure the area where you plan to use the fan and consider the room's dimensions. Dyson fans are available in various sizes, from compact desktop models to wall-mounted units suitable for larger spaces. The airflow and fan type determine how much space can be effectively cooled or circulated. 


### Power Settings and Control Options

Look for fans with multiple speed settings or adjustable airflow options to match your comfort preferences and energy consumption goals. Some models include automated features like temperature sensing or sleep timers, while others offer remote control capabilities. 


### Energy Efficiency and Operating Costs

Check the fan's energy rating and operating costs, as higher efficiency models can save money on electricity bills. Consider whether you need features like oscillation or whisper-quiet operation, as these increase energy consumption. 


### Maintenance and Noise Levels

Research how easily the fan's filters and components can be cleaned or replaced. While many Dyson fans operate quietly, some models produce noticeable noise, particularly at higher speeds. Consider whether the fan will be placed near sleeping areas or in quiet environments. 


## FAQ


### What is the difference between Dyson fan models?

Dyson fan models vary in size, airflow, and features. The Fan 60 offers powerful, concentrated airflow with a sleek, compact design, perfect for smaller spaces. The larger Fan 90 provides versatile airflow options, including oscillation, and includes features like an air multiplier and sleep mode for better sleep quality. 

The Fan 110 is the most powerful model, featuring three fan speeds, dual air multiplier technology, and oscillation. This model is ideal for rooms up to 350 square feet and includes smart features like Wi-Fi and touch controls for remote management. 


### How long does a Dyson fan's battery last?

Lithium-ion batteries in Dyson fans provide extended usage without electrical connection. The Fan 60 runs for 20 hours on a single charge, while the Fan 90 and 110 offer 15 and 10 hours respectively. The amount of time depends on the fan speed and feature usage during operation. 

When not in use, it's recommended to keep the fan connected to power. The battery maintains sufficient charge for quick restarts while extending the lifespan of the battery. 


### Can Dyson fans handle pet hair and dust?

Dyson fans are designed to minimize dust and pet hair accumulation through their advanced filtration systems. The fans' blades and frames feature anti-bacterial coating to prevent mold and bacteria growth, maintaining air quality. Regular maintenance of the fan's housing and filters removes collected particles without affecting airflow. 

For optimal performance, wash the fan housing weekly in warm water with mild detergent. Replace the primary filter monthly in environments with pets or heavy dust. The secondary filter requires replacement every six months under normal conditions. 


### What are the operating noise levels?

Dyson fans are engineered for quiet operation, with noise levels varying by model. The Fan 60 operates between 37-52 dBA, comparable to a library setting. The Fan 90 and 110 provide 37-60 dBA and 37-67 dBA respectively, making them suitable for quiet environments like home theaters or bedrooms. 

The fans' air multiplier technology, while increasing airflow, slightly raises the noise level to between 41-60 dBA. This technology directs air more efficiently, reducing motor noise while delivering concentrated airflow. 


### What maintenance is required for optimal performance?

The Dyson fans require minimal maintenance for consistent performance. Regularly wash the fan housing weekly in warm water with mild detergent to remove dust and pet hair. Replace the primary filter monthly if used in environments with pets or heavy dust. The secondary filter should be replaced every six months under normal conditions. 

Check the power cord and plug for damage weekly. Clean the motor housing monthly with a damp cloth. For models with touch controls, clean the display screen weekly with a microfiber cloth to prevent dust accumulation and maintain responsiveness. 


### How do the Wi-Fi features work?

Models with Wi-Fi enable remote control and monitoring through the Dysonlink app. Users can adjust settings, monitor fan status, and receive alerts about maintenance needs. The app allows scheduling of fan usage and customizing fan settings for different rooms or times of day. 

Both the Fan 110 and the recently released Fan 120 come with built-in Wi-Fi. These models allow users to connect to the app using Bluetooth for quick setup. The app requires active internet connection to access remote control features, but local fan operations work even without internet access.
