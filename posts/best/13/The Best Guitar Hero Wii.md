![Wii Guitar Hero 5 Stand-alone Guitar | Image](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcSclJhpuEMgtc89nHr5rRabkYEmOCroS\_HsSYtNPdgevYgpv5DF2sC6H7aH87gpw7h8ksWMSnwi-cRfe6OZzDVJaURIk-k3&usqp=CAY)

### [Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock [Wii Game]](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Guitar+Hero+Wii?utm\_term=guitar-hero-iii-legends-of-rock-wii-game)

![Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock [Wii Game] | Image](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcRBDXtocKdn5v7YD6BPxu\_q25nf2RmtCVxiEboroSl220skWabGi4UQsmxDFt-XT5ux1UXtFUSRK6arytpj780lyMWOvNug&usqp=CAY)

Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock brings the full rockstar experience to the Wii, with iconic bands including the Sex Pistols and Queens of the Stone Age challenging players to match their legendary riffs. The wireless guitar controller features improved strumming mechanics and wireless tech that doubles as a Wii Remote dock, letting you access menus while you play. Whether you're shredding alone or battling friends, this Wii favorite delivers the high-energy rock experience that made the original game a hit. 


### [Wii Guitar Hero Van Halen](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Guitar+Hero+Wii?utm\_term=wii-guitar-hero-van-halen)

![Wii Guitar Hero Van Halen | Image](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcQuNTBiQ2\_RPHAELz-dL1IcaAlrmet1s9haaAr1Gz3eM\_x5g-DcFFI1R3t1Z6qfYRXq5KCJ1gXM6gQDz9dOS8cOjxjG72oQ&usqp=CAY)

The Wii Guitar Hero Van Halen experience brings together the band's signature sounds with a collection of 25 classic tracks, including three of Eddie Van Halen's most iconic solos. While the game's engine shares similarities with previous titles, its strengths lie in the precision of note tracking and the gradually increasing difficulty that challenges players throughout the setlist. The addition of 19 guest artist tracks helps fill out the performance, though the omission of Michael Anthony and Sammy Hagar dampens the overall representation of the band's extensive catalog. 


### [Guitar Hero: Metallica | Nintendo Wii](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Guitar+Hero+Wii?utm\_term=guitar-hero-metallica-nintendo-wii)

![Guitar Hero: Metallica | Nintendo Wii | Image](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcT1yXMb7mcIY4eVjf4Bq5DS\_UnGni-XKgP5T1AmsGB1I\_eJZ96wkJutbHyWdNuRHqiHR4fD1AUZs4v\_g2zhOiGU\_I-O9cD\_&usqp=CAY)

This pre-owned Wii game lets you rock out with Metallica. The guitar controller gives you a authentic playing experience, though you might find some scratches or dents on the controller since it's been around the block a few times. The basics are still there, like the game itself and the power adapter, but don't expect the original box or manual - they're MIA. 


### [Guitar Hero Warrior's Rock (Wii)](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Guitar+Hero+Wii?utm\_term=guitar-hero-warriors-rock-wii)

![Guitar Hero Warrior's Rock (Wii) | Image](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcS2duN0kwhCnMRSdaUQL0PODHY6gIx\_dBgurLbaNA1DDa-isCUD0FiHTciZIvPCOqgh8Ws3wVsHKvjwKJ\_e9d5KAvyUSVwb&usqp=CAY)

The original Wii Guitar Hero World Tour package brings classic rock anthems and modern hits together in an engaging party game that stands up well to multiple playthroughs. While some minor issues with controller responsiveness and missing manual pages have been reported, the core gameplay holds up nicely, particularly in multi-player modes where competing virtual bands can get quite competitive. The included instruments work great when they're behaving – just be prepared for occasional glitches where you need to hit the red drum extra hard or the microphone gets a half-second lag on your vocal parts.
