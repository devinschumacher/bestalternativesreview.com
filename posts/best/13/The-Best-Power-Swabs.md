## FAQ

![Power-Swabs-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Power-Swabs-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a power swab?

A power swab is an electronic cleaning tool that combines a swab with a built-in motor and cleaning solution reservoir. When pressed against a surface, it releases cleaning fluid and rotates the swab to clean the area effectively. 

The technology allows for quick and efficient cleaning of tough stains and built-up grime, making it particularly useful for heavily soiled surfaces or difficult-to-reach areas. 


### What are the key features of a power swab?

Power swabs typically feature a motorized cleaning head that rotates the swab while applying cleaning solution. Many models include adjustable pressure settings and varying cleaning speeds to suit different surfaces and tasks. 

Standard features also include rechargeable batteries, LED lights indicating power levels, and portable designs for easy use anywhere. Some advanced models offer multiple cleaning heads for different surfaces and include carrying cases for storage. 

![Power-Swabs-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Power-Swabs-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What types of surfaces can I clean with a power swab?

Power swabs are effective for a wide range of surfaces, including countertops, floors, appliances, and fixtures. They work well on both hard and soft surfaces, making them versatile for various cleaning needs. 

These tools excel at removing tough grime, grease, and stains, particularly in kitchen and bathroom environments. However, they're not suitable for extremely delicate surfaces or porous materials that could be damaged by mechanical cleaning. 


### How long does a power swab battery last?

Power swab battery life varies by model, but most provide between 30-60 minutes of cleaning time on a single charge. Factors affecting battery life include cleaning speed, motor power, and the number of cleaning heads used. 

To extend battery life between charges, use the lowest appropriate speed setting, avoid keeping the swab locked between uses, and store the tool in a cool place when not in use. 

![Power-Swabs-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Power-Swabs-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What cleaning solutions work with power swabs?

Power swabs use specialized cleaning solutions that come in cartridges or bottles to fit the tool. These solutions are designed to work with the motorized cleaning head and are typically more effective than regular cleaning products. 

There are various types of cleaning solutions available, including those for tough grime, grease, and specific materials like granite or porcelain. Always check compatibility with your surface before using any cleaning solution. 


### How do I maintain a power swab?

Regular maintenance includes emptying the solution reservoir after each use, cleaning the swab head with water, and checking the motor brushes for wear. Store the tool in a dry place when not in use. 

Deep cleaning requires removing the swab head and cleaning the motor assembly, which should be done monthly or as needed based on usage. Always refer to the manufacturer's instructions for specific maintenance requirements.
