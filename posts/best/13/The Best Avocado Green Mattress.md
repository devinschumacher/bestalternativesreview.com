## Buyer's Guide

Sleeping on an avocado green mattress combines plush comfort with natural earthy tones, making it a distinctive choice for your bedroom. Understanding what makes these mattresses unique helps you find one that matches your sleep preferences and lifestyle. 


### Support and Firmness

Avocado green mattresses typically offer medium to medium-firm support, thanks to their natural latex cores. Look for pocketed coils or encapsulated foam layers to isolate pressure points and prevent partner disturbance. The thickness of the latex layer affects overall firmness - thinner layers are softer, while thicker ones provide firmer support.

### Sleep Temperature

Natural latex and organic cotton materials used in avocado green mattresses can make them slightly warmer than memory foam alternatives. Consider models with GOTS-certified organic cotton covers for better breathability. Some manufacturers incorporate phase-change materials or gel-infused elements to enhance temperature regulation during the night. 


### Size and Dimension

Standard mattress sizes include twin (38 inches wide), full (53 inches wide), queen (60 inches wide), and king (76 inches wide). For optimal support and reduced sagging, consider a mattress no more than 10 inches off the foundation's edge. The length should accommodate your body length, especially if you sleep on your side or are a longer sleeper.

### Edge Support and Durability

Edge support is crucial for maintaining consistent comfort around the perimeter. Look for mattresses with reinforced edges or "box-wall" construction. Natural latex core durability ranges from 10-15 years with proper care, but the outer fabric's quality affects longevity. Premium materials like GOTS-certified organic cotton or Tencel can extend the mattress's usable life. 


## FAQ

![Avocado-Green-Mattress-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Avocado-Green-Mattress-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What makes an Avocado Green mattress unique?

Avocado Green mattresses stand out in the market through their commitment to natural, organic materials. Unlike many traditional mattresses that use petrochemical-based foams, these beds feature a core made from natural Dunlop latex, wrapped in organic cotton and encased in waterproof talalay latex. The core also incorporates fresh Avocado Hull Extract for its hypoallergenic properties and cooling effect. 

What sets the Avocado Green mattress apart from organic options that may use blended latex is the use of 100% natural Dunlop latex throughout, ensuring consistent support without the need for additional foam layers. 


### How does the Avocado Green mattress handle body heat?

The dual-layered latex core with its built-in airflow channels helps dissipate heat effectively, making the mattress suitable for both hot sleepers and those who overheat during the night. Unlike some memory foams that can retain heat, the natural latex allows for greater breathability and a cooler sleeping environment. 

The waterproof layer prevents moisture from sinking into the core, maintaining consistent temperature regulation throughout the night. The combination of materials ensures optimal temperature management without the need for additional cooling features. 

![Avocado-Green-Mattress-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Avocado-Green-Mattress-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What's the core composition of the Avocado Green mattress?

The mattress features a three-layered core: the supportive layer uses natural Dunlop latex with Avocado Hull Extract, the transitional layer incorporates organic cotton, and the comfort layer consists of waterproof talalay latex. Together, these layers provide pressure relief, moisture barrier, and natural support. 

This construction differs from typical latex mattresses that might include petrochemical foams. The organic cotton and natural latex combination offers a more eco-friendly and hypoallergenic alternative. 


### How should I maintain the Avocado Green mattress?

Regular maintenance for an Avocado Green mattress involves spot cleaning the organic cotton cover with a mild soap and water solution. For deeper cleaning, the cover can be removed and washed separately. The core requires no special treatment beyond occasional airing to maintain its natural properties. 

When handling the mattress, use a padded or clean surface to prevent scratches. For turning, use the included carrying straps to rotate the mattress evenly, ensuring even wear and tear.

### What certifications does the Avocado Green mattress have?

The Avocado Green mattress carries several certifications that verify its organic and eco-friendly materials. These include CertiPUR-US for foam emissions, Oeko-Tex Standard 100 for textile safety, and Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) for organic cotton content. The mattress also meets California TB117 flammability standards without the use of chemical treatments. 

In addition to organic certifications, the mattress undergoes rigorous testing for durability and performance, including pressure distribution and edge-to-edge support testing. 


### What sizes are available for the Avocado Green mattress?

The standard Avocado Green mattress comes in Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, and Cal King sizes. All mattress sizes include a 9.5-inch foundation pad for proper support and a 90-day trial period for comfort testing. 

Custom order options include adding a 100-pound weight capacity to certain sizes and choosing between extra-firm and medium-firm comfort levels. The company also offers the option to upgrade to a premium organic cotton cover for an additional fee.
