## Buyer's Guide

Cabrito tequila stands out in the tequila market with its unique flavor profile and distinct production process. Understanding the key aspects of cabrito tequila helps in making an informed choice, whether you're a tequila enthusiast or new to the spirit. 


### Production Process

Cabrito tequila is made from 100% blue Weber agave, focusing on the heart (piña) of the plant. Unlike traditional tequilas that may include older agave varieties, cabrito exclusively uses younger agaves, typically harvested between 3 to 4 years old. This younger age imparts a lighter body and sweeter profile to the final product.

### Flavor Profile

The flavor profile of cabrito tequila emphasizes sweeter, fruitier notes compared to traditional tequilas. The younger agave content results in smoother, more approachable flavors with hints of tropical fruits and subtle agave sweetness. The aging process in oak barrels adds complexity, bringing vanilla, toast, and caramel notes to the spirit while maintaining its inherent fruitiness. 


### Blending and Aged Variants

Many cabrito tequilas undergo blending with neutral spirits to achieve consistent flavor profiles. This practice allows producers to maintain batch-to-batch consistency, particularly for entry-level products. Higher-end cabrito tequilas often include aged variants, with some experiencing up to 3 years of barrel aging. These aged versions showcase richer flavors and increased complexity.
