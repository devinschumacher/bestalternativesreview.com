## FAQ


### What is a Chartpak marker?

A Chartpak marker is a type of permanent marker specifically designed for professional presentations and charts. It uses a specialized ink formula that resists fading and smudging, making it ideal for marking on various materials. 

The markers typically feature an ergonomic grip and come in a variety of tip sizes for different writing needs. They are commonly used in business settings for creating clear, lasting visual aids. 


### What makes Chartpak markers different from regular permanent markers?

Chartpak markers incorporate a thicker ink flow system that prevents feathering and uneven lines, even on glossy or uneven surfaces. This specialized ink system is also designed to last longer under harsh conditions. 

Additionally, the markers often feature premium construction with metal caps and high-quality ink cartridges that reduce clogging and leaks. 


### What materials can Chartpak markers be used on?

These markers work well on a variety of surfaces including whiteboards, overhead projector sheets, glass, plastic, and cardboard. Their ink formula allows for clear visibility on both smooth and slightly textured materials. 

The markers also perform well on a range of paper types, including smooth office paper and presentation charts, though they may not perform as well on very porous or absorbent surfaces. 


### How long do Chartpak markers last?

A single Chartpak marker typically lasts between 5-7 days of regular use, depending on the frequency of refills and proper storage conditions. The ink flow system tends to maintain its effectiveness longer than standard permanent markers. 

The lifespan of the marker can be extended by keeping the cap on when not in use and storing the marker in a cool, dry place to prevent ink evaporation. 


### What are the typical tip sizes available for Chartpak markers?

The most common tip sizes for Chartpak markers are 0.5mm and 1.0mm, which provide versatile line options for detailed work and broader strokes, respectively. 

Some premium versions may offer additional tip sizes, including 0.8mm for intermediate line widths, giving users more options for their presentation needs. 


### How should Chartpak markers be used for best results?

To achieve optimal results, use a steady, even pressure when writing or drawing. Avoid applying too much pressure, as this can cause the ink flow system to malfunction. 

Allow each mark to dry completely before adding additional ink or overlaying the same spot to prevent running or smudging.
