## FAQ


### What is Monat Rejuveniqe Oil?

Monat Rejuveniqe Oil is a targeted skincare treatment that combines a retinol complex with blue light technology to address signs of aging. The oil promotes cell turnover, reduces fine lines, and improves skin texture when used in combination with the Rejuveniqe LED device. 

The product contains a blend of retinol, niacinamide, and blue light-activated pigments that work synergistically to boost cellular renewal and enhance skin radiance. It's suitable for daily use on clean, dry skin before applying the Rejuveniqe LED device. 


### How does Monat Rejuveniqe Oil work with the LED device?

The oil needs to be applied to the skin before using the Rejuveniqe LED device. The blue light activates the pigments in the oil, which helps to improve penetration and enhance the effectiveness of the retinol complex. This combination works to boost collagen production, reduce hyperpigmentation, and improve overall skin health. 

Users should apply a few drops of oil to their face and neck after cleaning and toning their skin. The LED device should be turned on and pressed against the skin for 3-5 minutes, allowing the combination of ingredients to work together for optimal results. 


### Who is Monat Rejuveniqe Oil suitable for?

Monat Rejuveniqe Oil is suitable for adults with mild to moderate signs of aging, including fine lines, wrinkles, and uneven skin tone. It's most effective for those who have used retinol in the past and want to enhance its effects with advanced LED technology. 

While the product is generally safe, individuals with sensitive skin or those who have never used retinol should start with a lower concentration (0.1%) and monitor their skin's response. Those with active acne or severe skin conditions should consult a dermatologist before use. 


### What are the potential side effects of Monat Rejuveniqe Oil?

Common side effects of using Monat Rejuveniqe Oil include temporary reddness, warmth, and increased sensitivity to sun exposure. These effects usually subside within a few hours and can be minimized by using sunscreen and starting with lower concentrations. 

Some users may experience mild irritation, especially if they have sensitive skin or use the product daily from the start. Discontinuing use or reducing the frequency of application usually resolves these issues. Persistent irritation or unusual skin reactions should be evaluated by a dermatologist. 


### How long does it take to see results from Monat Rejuveniqe Oil?

Most users notice visible improvements in skin texture and tone after 4-6 weeks of consistent use. Fine lines and wrinkles may start to show signs of improvement in this timeframe, though more significant changes can take 3 months or longer. 

It's important to note that results vary depending on individual skin type, age-related changes, and the severity of underlying skin concerns. Continued use of the Rejuveniqe LED device and the oil together is recommended for optimal results. 


### How should Monat Rejuveniqe Oil be stored?

Monat Rejuveniqe Oil should be stored in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat sources. It's best kept at room temperature (around 68-77°F or 20-25°C) to maintain its effectiveness and prevent separation of the oil mixture. 

The product should be used within 6 months of opening and protected from air and light to preserve its potency. Always close the bottle tightly and keep it away from moisture to extend its shelf life.
