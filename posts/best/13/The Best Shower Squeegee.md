## Buyer's Guide

A quality shower squeegee is essential for maintaining a clean, dry bathroom. This compact tool removes excess water from shower walls, preventing mold and mildew while keeping your space dry. Here's what to consider when selecting the right squeegee for your needs. 


### Materials and Construction

High-quality squeegees feature durable, BPA-free plastic handles with antimicrobial properties to prevent mold growth. The blade should be made from tough, heat-resistant TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane) or similar material that resists warping and cracking. Premium models often include replaceable blade systems to extend the tool's lifespan. 

![Shower-Squeegee-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Shower-Squeegee-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Size and Shape

Select a squeegee with a blade length that matches your shower space. Standard blades measure 12-18 inches, but longer options are available for larger enclosures. The handle should be comfortable to grip, with a length that allows full-body extension while cleaning. Curved or angled handles can reach awkward spots and provide better leverage. 


### Storage and Organization

Look for a squeegee with a clip or stand feature that prevents water damage when not in use. The storage mechanism should keep the blade clean and dry, reducing the risk of bacteria growth. Consider models that fold, telescope, or hang for space-saving options in small bathrooms.

### Additional Features

Some premium squeegees include angled blades for reaching corners, dual-blade systems for extra coverage, or extended handles for tall users. The grip surface should be free from slippery materials and provide a secure hold during use. Look for tools with rounded edges to prevent injury and improve overall safety. 


## FAQ

![Shower-Squeegee-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Shower-Squeegee-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a shower squeegee?

A shower squeegee is a tool designed to remove excess water from shower walls and glass doors after each use. It typically consists of a long handle connected to a rubber or silicone head that can be squeezed to distribute water evenly across the desired surface. 

The primary function of a shower squeegee is to prevent water spots, mold, and mildew by keeping the shower walls and glass free from standing water. This helps maintain a cleaner, more hygienic shower environment. 


### What materials are shower squeegees made from?

Shower squeegees are typically made from ABS plastic or aluminum for the handle, with rubber or silicone heads. The head material is crucial as rubber and silicone are more effective at water absorption and less likely to harbor bacteria. 

Some premium models feature stainless steel or other corrosion-resistant materials to prevent rusting and extend the product's lifespan. 

![Shower-Squeegee-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Shower-Squeegee-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do I properly use a shower squeegee?

Hold the squeegee at an angle of about 45 degrees and use a sweeping motion from bottom to top, working across the entire surface you want to dry. The rubber or silicone head should make direct contact with the shower wall or glass door. 

For optimal results, squeeze the head gently while pressing against the surface to ensure efficient water removal. The squeegee should be used in a zigzag pattern to cover the entire area, leaving minimal water spots behind. 


### How often should I replace my shower squeegee?

Most shower squeegees need replacement after 6-12 months of regular use, depending on the frequency of use and water quality. Signs that indicate it's time to replace include excessive shedding of rubber pieces, worn-out bristles, or visible stains on the surface. 

Regular inspection of the head material for cracks or deteriorating rubber can help you determine when replacement is necessary. Additionally, if you notice a significant increase in water spots or mold after using your squeegee, it may need replacement. 

![Shower-Squeegee-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Shower-Squeegee-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can I use my shower squeegee in the bathtub?

Shower squeegees are primarily designed for shower walls and glass doors due to their specific angles and handle designs. Using them in the bathtub may not provide optimal results and could damage the tub's finish over time. 

For bathtubs, consider using a dedicated rubber mat or a longer-handled squeegee specifically designed for the bathtub's configuration. 


### How should I maintain my shower squeegee?

After each use, wipe the squeegee head with a clean cloth or paper towel to remove any trapped water or debris. Rinse the head under warm water if it becomes visibly soiled. 

For regular maintenance, soak the squeegee in a solution of mild soap and water for 10-15 minutes, then scrub the head gently with a soft-bristled brush to remove any accumulated grime. Dry thoroughly before storage to prevent mold and mildew growth.
