## Buyer's Guide

When looking for running boards that can handle the rigors of off-road driving while maintaining a stylish appearance, Rough Country's products are a popular choice. Their running boards are designed to be both functional and durable, making them a valuable addition to any vehicle that sees regular trail use. 


### Material Quality

Rough Country offers running boards made from high-strength aluminum, which provides a balance of weight and durability. The aluminum is treated with a protective oxide coating to prevent corrosion, ensuring the boards remain in excellent condition even after years of exposure to the elements. 


### Installation Compatibility

Before selecting a pair of running boards, it's crucial to ensure they will fit your specific vehicle model and year. Rough Country offers boards that attach directly to the factory body mounts, requiring minimal modification to the vehicle. This direct-mount design helps maintain clearance for running lights and other factory features.

These extra features can enhance both the functionality and longevity of the product, so consider what would be most beneficial for your specific needs and driving style.
