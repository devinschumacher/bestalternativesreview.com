### Blade Design and Materials

Chrome-vanadium steel forms the core of this blade, offering a balance of strength and flexibility. The 3.75-inch length suits both general camping and detailed work.

![Crkt-Ceo-Knife-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Crkt-Ceo-Knife-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)

Three-rivet construction features G10 handle material for durability and texture. The straight spine design and three-finger grip pattern promote control during precise work. The overall weight balances well with the blade, though some may find it slightly heavy for casual use. 


### Overall Build Quality

A full tang design ensures blade stability, while the frame-lock mechanism secures the blade in the open position. The knife measures 7.8 inches closed, making it easy to carry in a sheath or pocket sheath. The blade lock and mechanism reliability are critical aspects of its build quality.
