## Buyer's Guide

Kaleidoscope hair products offer a vibrant array of styling options, from vivid pastels to metallic finishes. These temporary color treatments can transform any hairstyle with striking results that wash out gradually over several washes. 


### Color Selection and Undertones

When choosing hair product colors, consider your skin tone and natural hair color. Warm undertones typically look best with yellow-based colors, while cool tones suit blue-based shades. For natural hair colors, dark hair usually carries more potential for intense colors, while lighter hair may need a stronger application for noticeable results.

### Application Techniques

Proper application ensures even color distribution and prevents uneven results. Most products come with a specific application method, such as finger painting or using a specialized brush. Pay special attention to the roots and edges, where colors may vary. For best results, apply color in sections, allowing each section to dry before moving to the next. 


### Duration and Maintenance

Temporary hair colors typically last 2-3 washes before fading. To extend wear time, use products formulated for longer-lasting color retention. Avoid using harsh chemicals like bleach or hair dyes before applying temporary color, as these can damage the hair and affect the color's adhesion.

### Preparation and Aftercare

Before application, ensure your hair is clean, dry, and free from tangles. For the best adherence, apply the color to slightly damp hair. After coloring, avoid immediate exposure to water or heat styling until the color has fully set. To maintain color integrity, use shampoo and conditioner designed for color-treated hair.
