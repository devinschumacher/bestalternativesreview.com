Check if the TV supports the latest Roku software features, such as voice control and app compatibility with your favorite streaming services. This ensures you get the most out of your connected viewing experience. 


### Smart TV Features and User Interface

While all TVs mentioned have Roku functionality, some models offer additional smart TV features like built-in apps, web browsers, or AI voice assistants. Evaluate which features enhance your viewing experience and confirm the TV's webOS version to ensure access to the latest optimizations and security updates. 


### Size and Mounting Options

At 32 inches, these TVs are portable enough for small rooms or apartments. Consider the aspect ratio (16:9) and whether you prefer portrait orientation. Also, check which wall-mounting options are compatible to ensure proper support and cable management.
