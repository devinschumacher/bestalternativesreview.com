## Buyer's Guide

Dewalt brushless drills combine powerful performance with efficient operation, making them a popular choice for professionals and serious DIY enthusiasts. Understanding their key features and how they compare to traditional drills can help you select the right tool for your projects. 


### Power and Torque

These drills use brushless motors that deliver consistent power and torque, even at high speeds. Look for models with variable speed controls and torque settings for precise drilling and driving. 

![Dewalt-Brushless-Drill-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Dewalt-Brushless-Drill-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Battery Technology

Dewalt brushless drills typically use lithium-ion batteries that offer longer run times and better durability than older technologies. Consider the battery's voltage rating and the drill's compatibility with different battery packs. 


### Chassis Design

The drill's body design affects its stability and comfort during use. Rigid, well-balanced drills with ergonomic grips provide better control and reduce hand fatigue, especially during heavy-duty tasks. 

![Dewalt-Brushless-Drill-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Dewalt-Brushless-Drill-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Bit Compatibility

Most Dewalt brushless drills accept standard straight and twist drill bits, but check compatibility with special bits like metalwork or masonry drill bits. Some models offer additional features like bit holders or quick-change mechanisms. 


## FAQ

![Dewalt-Brushless-Drill-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Dewalt-Brushless-Drill-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What's the difference between a brushless and brushed motor in a drill?

A brushless motor uses electronic switches to control the motor's speed, while a brushed motor relies on physical brushes to conduct electricity. This results in the brushless motor being more efficient, producing less heat and delivering longer runtime between charges. 

Brushless motors are about 20% more powerful than brushed motors of the same size, making them ideal for heavy-duty applications where extended runtime and reduced maintenance are essential. 


### How long does it take to charge a Dewalt Brushless Drill?

Most Dewalt brushless drills come with a 20V Max battery that charges fully in approximately 45 minutes using the DEWALT 20V MAX Charger. 

Users report being able to get 30-45 minutes of drilling time from a single charge, depending on the drill model and the specific battery's amp-hour rating. 

![Dewalt-Brushless-Drill-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Dewalt-Brushless-Drill-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What kind of warranty comes with Dewalt Brushless Drills?

All Dewalt brushless drills come with a 2-year limited warranty that covers defects in materials and workmanship. The company also offers an extended warranty, available for purchase at the time of purchase, that covers the tool for an additional 3 years. 

Users note that Dewalt's warranty service is generally simple to use, with many reporting good customer service and quick resolution times for any covered issues. 


### Can I use the same battery in a cordless impact driver?

Most Dewalt brushless drills are compatible with the same 20V Max battery system used in their cordless impact drivers, allowing you to easily switch between these tools. 

However, the torque output and overall power may differ between the drill and impact driver, so the specific application should dictate which tool is used. 

![Dewalt-Brushless-Drill-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Dewalt-Brushless-Drill-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How does the drill weight affect its performance?

The weight of a Dewalt brushless drill can significantly impact its balance and control, particularly during extended use on challenging projects. The company offers models ranging from 3.2 to 6.5 pounds to accommodate different user preferences and application needs. 

While heavier drills provide better stability and control, lighter models offer increased maneuverability and reduced arm fatigue, making the ideal weight a balance between these factors based on the specific work requirements. 


### How often should I service my Dewalt Brushless Drill?

Regular maintenance includes checking the battery contacts for corrosion, ensuring the chuck is properly lubricated, and cleaning the exterior of the drill to prevent dust accumulation. Most users find that performing these basic checks monthly helps maintain optimal tool performance. 

Dewalt recommends professional servicing every 6-12 months, particularly if the tool is used regularly in dusty or harsh environments. This service checks for internal wear and ensures the motor continues to operate efficiently.
