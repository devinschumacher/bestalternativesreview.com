When selecting an Ora Organic Protein Powder, several key factors influence its quality and suitability for your nutritional needs. 


### Protein Source and Quality

The primary component of protein powder is the source material, which can range from whey, casein, or plant-based options like pea, brown rice, or hemp.

### Organic and Non-GMO Standards

Look for certifications from recognized organic organizations to ensure the powder meets rigorous environmental and production standards. Additionally, verify that the product uses non-GMO ingredients to avoid genetically modified components that might compromise its purity and nutritional value. 


### Flavor and Texture Considerations

Assess the available flavor options and their impact on taste and consistency. High-quality protein powders blend smoothly into liquid mixtures without clumping or odd flavors. Some may contain artificial sweeteners or thickeners; opt for natural alternatives like stevia or psyllium when possible.
