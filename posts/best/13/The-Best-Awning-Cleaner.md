## Buyer's Guide

Awnings require regular cleaning to maintain their appearance and prolong their lifespan. Awnings come in various materials, including polyester, mesh, and PVC, each requiring specific care. This guide outlines essential features and considerations for awning cleaners that effectively remove dust, dirt, and mild stains without damaging the fabric or coating. 


### Material Compatibility

AWG [Awnings, Inc. ] recommends cleaners that are safe for their specific awning materials. For example, while standard soap and water work for some polyester awnings, others require specialized waterproofing solutions. Check the cleaner's compatibility list or consult the awning manufacturer's recommendations to avoid damage. 


### Waterproofing Preservations

Many awning cleaners also contain mildewcides or waterproofing agents. When selecting a cleaner, consider whether you need a product that enhances water resistance or focuses solely on cleaning. Using a cleaner with unnecessary additives may affect the awning's performance and could void warranties. 


### Application Methods

Choose a cleaner that suits your application method. Stream sprayers are ideal for thorough cleaning of larger surfaces, while foam applicators can reduce water usage and improve coverage. Consider whether you prefer a straightforward spray bottle or a more specialized applicator for your cleaning needs. 


### Environmental Impact

Eco-friendly cleaners made from natural ingredients are becoming increasingly popular due to their biodegradable properties and reduced chemical impact. If environmental concerns influence your choice, look for cleaners certified by organizations like Green Seal or EcoLogo that verify their sustainable attributes. 


## FAQ


### What is an awning cleaner?

An awning cleaner is a specialized product designed specifically for cleaning and maintaining outdoor awnings. These cleaners are formulated to remove dirt, grime, and mildew while protecting the fabric's UV protection and color integrity. 

Most awning cleaners contain mild detergents and may include protective agents like water repellents and UV stabilizers. They are typically available in spray bottles or concentrate forms for dilution with water. 


### When should I clean my awning?

Regular cleaning is necessary to maintain awning appearance and functionality. This typically occurs twice a year, before and after the peak sun exposure season. Additionally, remove debris and heavy rain residue as soon as possible to prevent stain formation. 

Environmental factors such as high pollution, salty air, or chemical exposure may require more frequent cleaning to prevent damage to the awning fabric. 


### How do I prepare an awning for cleaning?

Before cleaning, inspect the awning for any damage or loose sections. Check weather conditions before proceeding - avoid cleaning on windy days, and work in sections to prevent water from reaching uncleaned areas. 

Move any nearby furniture or landscaping to prevent damage from cleaning equipment. If the awning has specialized coatings or treatments, check the manufacturer's instructions for specific cleaning requirements. 


### What equipment do I need for cleaning?

The basic tools needed include a garden hose with adjustable nozzle, a squeegee, and a long-handled brush or wand attachment. For larger awnings, extendable poles may be necessary to reach high areas. 

Protective gear like gloves and goggles should be worn during cleaning. Consider wearing old clothing that can get wet and dusty, as cleaning products may damage fabric if spilled on clothing. 


### Can I use an awning cleaner on other fabrics?

Awnings are often made from special outdoor fabrics designed for durability and longevity. General-purpose cleaners may damage these fabrics, reducing their protective properties and lifespan. 

Always refer to the awning manufacturer's recommendations for compatible cleaning products. If unsure, test a small, inconspicuous area before application to ensure compatibility with the specific fabric type. 


### How should I store awning cleaner?

Store awning cleaner in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and sources of heat. Most products have a shelf life of 1-2 years, but check the manufacturer's instructions for specific recommendations. 

Keep the container tightly closed when not in use to maintain product integrity and prevent evaporation. If purchasing a concentrate, store the unused portion in the original container to maintain proper labeling and safety information.
