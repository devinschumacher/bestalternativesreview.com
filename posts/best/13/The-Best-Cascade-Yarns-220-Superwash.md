## Buyer's Guide

Cascade Yarns 220 Superwash is a versatile worsted weight yarn blend known for its durability and machine-washability. When selecting a skein, consider the fiber content, yardage, color availability, and how the superwash treatment affects stitch structure. 


### Material Composition

This yarn features a blend of wool, nylon, and other fibers. The wool content provides warmth and texture, while the nylon enhances wear-resistance and maintains shape. Understanding the specific fiber ratio helps predict how the yarn will perform in different projects. 


### Yardage and Weight

The 220 yard per skein delivers sufficient length for most worsted weight patterns. Projects requiring more yardage can be combined seamlessly without noticeable color differences. Consider how the yardage aligns with your pattern's requirements. 


### Color Selection

 Cascades offers a range of solid and variegated colors. Solid hues maintain their appearance best, while modern colorways can create interesting visual effects. Consider how color options match your intended project and color scheme. 


### Maintenance Considerations

While superwash treatment makes care easier, understanding how it affects stitch definition is crucial. The process may slightly alter texture compared to unprocessed wool. Choose colors that translate well both washed and unwashed for consistent project results.
