## Buyer's Guide

Choosing the right foam runners can significantly enhance your furniture's durability and comfort. These underlayments prevent scratches between legs and floors while adding cushioning to your seating. Our guide outlines key considerations to help you select the perfect foam runners for your needs. 


### Material Density

![Foam-Runners-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Foam-Runners-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)

Higher density foam runners provide better cushioning and durability. Consider density grades: light (2 lb/in²), medium (3 lb/in²), and heavy-duty (4 lb/in²). The surface you're protecting determines the necessary grade - 4 lb/in² for hardwood and engineered floors, 3 lb/in² for laminate, and 2 lb/in² for carpeted surfaces. 


### Size and Fit

Standard foam runner sizes accommodate most furniture legs (3/4" to 1.5"). Custom sizes might be needed for unique leg shapes or particularly large furniture pieces. Measure your legs and add 1/2" to determine the appropriate runner length. Ensure the width is at least 2" more than your furniture's leg diameter for proper support. 

![Foam-Runners-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Foam-Runners-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Installation and Removal

Look for foam runners with self-adhesive backing for quick installation, especially useful in rental properties or when frequent moving is anticipated. For more durable furniture, consider open-cell foam runners that press-fit into grooves along furniture legs. This method is ideal for stationary furniture but requires precise cutting to match leg sizes. 


### Economical Options

![Foam-Runners-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Foam-Runners-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)

Bulk purchases offer the best value, with packages typically available in 12, 24, or 36-counts. Single-leg foam runners are more expensive per unit but convenient for occasional replacements or small furniture pieces. Compare the upfront cost with your furniture's longevity to determine the most economical choice. 


## FAQ

![Foam-Runners-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Foam-Runners-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are foam runners?

 Foam runners are cushioned strips that protect furniture legs from scuffs and scratches when moving a piece of furniture. They provide a soft landing surface and prevent damage to both the furniture and the floors being walked on during the move. 

These protective runners are typically made from closed-cell foam, which offers durability and moisture resistance. They come in varying lengths and widths to fit different furniture sizes and styles, with some featuring adhesive backing for easy installation. 


### How do foam runners work?

![Foam-Runners-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Foam-Runners-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)

When placed under furniture legs, foam runners act as shock absorbers, reducing impact force as the piece is moved. The closed-cell foam structure prevents floor damage by distributing pressure evenly and cushioning hard furniture legs against soft wood or carpeted surfaces. 

After installation, foam runners require minimal maintenance. They can be easily trimmed to fit irregular legs and are resistant to wear from daily use, although replacement may be necessary after several years of regular furniture movement. 


### Are foam runners suitable for all furniture types?

 Foam runners work well with most furniture types, including beds, dressers, and chairs. They're particularly effective for legs made from hard materials like metal, plastic, or solid wood, which can cause scratches on floors during movement. 

However, they may not be suitable for furniture with extremely delicate legs or those intended for outdoor use without proper weather resistance. Always check the product specifications to ensure compatibility with your specific furniture pieces. 


### How long do foam runners last?

 Well-maintained foam runners typically last 3-5 years, depending on usage frequency and environmental conditions. Factors affecting longevity include exposure to direct sunlight, repeated heavy furniture movement, and indoor vs. outdoor installation. 

Regular inspection for signs of wear, such as flattened edges or exposed foam, can help extend their lifespan. Proper care through periodic trimming and avoidance of extreme conditions may increase their durability to 7-10 years. 


### What are the installation requirements for foam runners?

 Installation typically requires no special tools or adhesives, making the process simple and quick. Most foam runners have a self-adhesive backing that adheres directly to furniture legs, or they can be cut to size and placed over existing legs without modification. 

For optimal protection, runners should be placed on all legs of a piece of furniture. The foam surface should be flush with the leg's bottom, with a slight gap between the floor and the foam's top to prevent wear and tear.
