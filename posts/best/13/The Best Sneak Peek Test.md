Most Sneak Peek Tests are open to the general public, but some manufacturers may require specific demographics (age, tech-savviness, etc. ) based on their product target market. 

Eligibility criteria are clearly stated in the test's terms. Common requirements include a valid email address and proof of residence in the manufacturer's geographical area.
