### Seat Design and Comfort Features

Seats can be upholstered in leather, fabric, or left natural for wood frames. Padded seats enhance comfort, while backrest designs vary from straight to upholstered. Consider the overall height and leg design, as they affect both seating depth and visual balance in the dining space. 


### Finish and Color Options

Finishes range from matte and distressed to high-polish, allowing you to match your existing dÃ©cor or create a focal point. Many styles come in multiple colors, from neutral tones to bold statements. The finish selected impacts both appearance and ease of maintenance.

### Durability and Maintenance Requirements

Determine which material best suits your needs considering family size and use frequency. Upholstered pieces require more maintenance than wood or metal frames. If you have pets or young children, opt for finish options that resist scratches and stains.

### What is the construction quality of Bernhardt dining chairs?

Bernhardt's dining chairs employ a robust construction approach, with solid wood and metal components often featuring mortise-and-tenon joinery and wire-brushed finishes that enhance durability without compromising the natural beauty of the material. 

Their frame structures typically use premium-grade hardwood or engineered wood, with visible joints reinforced for long-term stability. The seats are supported by solid wood legs with metal cap hardware to prevent wear and ensure consistent weight distribution.
