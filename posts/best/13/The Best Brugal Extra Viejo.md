The result: a premium 80-proof sipper that delivers big flavor at a surprisingly reasonable price.

### What is Brugal Extra Viejo?

Brugal Extra Viejo is a premium white rum produced by the Brugal Rum Distillery in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Bottled at 43% ABV, it's the strongest expression in the Brugal lineup, offering both traditional and young barrels for distinct flavor profiles.

### What makes Brugal Extra Viejo different from other premium rums?

Unlike many premium rums that focus on a single aging technique, Brugal produces two distinct versions of its Extra Viejo. The traditional barrel version offers classic rum characteristics, while the second version aged in both traditional and French pine barrels introduces additional complexity and character. 

The careful control over the aging process and barrel types results in a more nuanced flavor profile compared to many premium rums, making it a distinctive choice in the category.

Brugal recommends serving Extra Viejo neat or in a traditional old-fashioned glass with a few drops of Angostura bitters. This highlights the rum's complexity without overshadowing its natural flavors.

### How does Brugal Extra Viejo compare to other aged rums?

At 43% ABV, Brugal Extra Viejo is one of the strongest premium blends available, offering more concentrated flavors than many competitors in the same category. This higher proof allows the complex interplay of oak and rum character to emerge more prominently. 

When compared to similarly aged spirits, the French pine barrel version stands out for its distinctive fusion of traditional rum characteristics with refined spice notes, making it particularly memorable. 


### What bottles and packaging options are available for Brugal Extra Viejo?

The standard Brugal Extra Viejo comes in an elegant black-stenciled bottle with the company's distinctive branding, featuring the Brugal don's image. It's typically available in 750ml and 500ml formats.
