## Buyer's Guide

Critter cages are essential for housing small animals like rabbits, guinea pigs, and ferrets. When selecting a cage, consider the following key factors to ensure your pet has a safe, comfortable living environment. 


### Cage Size

Proper cage dimensions are crucial for maintaining your pet's health and well-being. The general guideline is to provide at least 8 square feet of floor space per adult rabbit, 2-3 square feet for guinea pigs, and 1-2 square feet for ferrets. Smaller animals need more vertical space for exercise, while larger animals require more horizontal space for movement. 

![Critter-Cage-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Critter-Cage-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Cage Materials

The cage's construction affects its durability and ease of cleaning. Cage bars should be solid or welded to prevent chewing hazards. Wire mesh cages need a minimum 1/4-inch spacing to prevent small animals from getting their feet or limbs trapped. Consider using plastic or metal cages, as they resist stains and are easier to clean than wood. 


### Environmental Features

Include features that promote natural behaviors and health. Multi-level cages with varying heights allow pets to climb and explore. Runways or connecting tunnels facilitate exercise and mental stimulation. Securely anchored accessories like shelves, tubes, and ramps provide additional spatial options while maintaining stability. 

![Critter-Cage-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Critter-Cage-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Accessibility and Safety

Design elements that enhance ease of cleaning and maintenance are important. Removable floors simplify waste management and sanitization. Grated tops or full enclosure designs protect animals from potential escape attempts while allowing proper ventilation. Ensure all components safely attach to prevent accidental detachment that could injure your pet. 


## FAQ

![Critter-Cage-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Critter-Cage-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a critter cage?

A critter cage is a specialized enclosure designed to house small animals like hamsters, gerbils, rabbits, and guinea pigs. These cages combine durable construction with features that promote animal welfare and ease of cleaning for owners. 

Key elements typically include wire mesh walls for ventilation, solid bottom panels (for larger animals), and removable trays for waste collection. Many designs feature multiple levels with shelves and ramps, providing exercise opportunities and vertical space. 


### What materials are used in critter cage construction?

The most common materials are galvanized steel wire, stainless steel, and sometimes plastic for components like doors and accessories. These materials offer durability and resistance to rust and corrosion, essential for long-term cage use. 

For the cage base, solid wood or high-density plastic is preferred to prevent burrowing animals from digging through. Wire mesh walls provide essential ventilation while keeping pets safe from escaping or predators. 

![Critter-Cage-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Critter-Cage-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How should I choose the right size cage?

Minimum requirements vary by species, but a general rule is to provide at least 2 square feet of cage space per guinea pig, 1.5 square feet per rabbit, and 1 square foot per small rodent. Larger spaces are beneficial for exercise and comfort. 

Calculate the total usable floor space by measuring the cage area and subtracting any non-walkable surfaces like shelves or ledges. Vertical space is important too - allow 2-3 feet of height for most small animals. 


### What features are important for daily pet care?

A cage with a large, easy-to-remove bottom tray is essential for maintaining hygiene. Many cages now include double-decker designs with separate sections for sleeping and bathroom habits, which can reduce odor and stress. 

Bars and gaps in the wire mesh should be small enough to prevent escapes (1/2 inch is recommended) but large enough for proper ventilation. Some cages now feature adjustable bars to accommodate growing pets or different species sizes. 

![Critter-Cage-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Critter-Cage-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do I keep the cage clean?

Most cages come with removable trays that should be cleaned daily. Wire mesh walls require regular hosing down or vacuuming with a pet-safe attachment. Solid surfaces like wood or plastic can be wiped with pet-safe cleaners weekly. 

Regular cage maintenance includes checking all hardware for wear, assessing wire integrity, and cleaning food and water dishes daily. Replace any damaged components and thoroughly clean the cage every 2-3 weeks to prevent odors and health issues. 


### What should I consider for long-term pet care?

Cage design should accommodate your pet's natural behaviors, whether that means providing plenty of horizontal space for running, vertical space for rabbits, or hiding spots for smaller rodents. Multi-level designs can double as exercise equipment. 

Think about future-proofing your pet's home by selecting a cage with expandable options or modular designs that can grow with your pet. Consider easy-access points for cleaning and pet introduction, and select materials that resist scratches and chewing damage.
