When DIY home canning became essential last year, Pur answered the call with BPA-free wide mouth lids that promised 18-month seals. While some reviewers report successful long-term preservation, others warn of consistent buckling issues during processing and premature seal failures within months of canning.

The Country Classics Regular Mouth Lids pack offers 12 one-time use lids that should fit any standard 70mm regular mouth mason jar. However, user reviews raise serious concerns about seal quality and durability, with many reporting lid failure and buckling issues after just one use in both water bath and pressure canners. While a minority of users have had success with jam and sauce jars, the thin metal construction appears to be problematic for pressure canning and other applications requiring lasting seals.

## Buyer's Guide

Bulk canning lids are a crucial component for home food preservation, ensuring that sealed containers maintain their freshness and safety. Understanding the key aspects of canning lids will help you select the right product for your preservation needs. 


### Materials and Construction

Most bulk canning lids are made from aluminum or tin-plated steel. Aluminum lids are lightweight and cost-effective, ideal for occasional canning. Tin-plated steel provides superior protection against corrosion and is recommended for frequent users. Ensure the lids you choose are BPA-free for peace of mind. 


### Sizing and Compatibility

Verify that your bulk lids match the diameter of your canning jars. Common sizes include 50 ct, 100 ct, and 250 ct packs. Consider whether you need standard or wide-mouth lids, as well as the appropriate sealing compound type (water wash or paraffin). 


### Storage and Handling

Proper storage extends the life and effectiveness of your lids. Keep them in a dry place, tightly sealed in their original container to maintain freshness. Before use, check for dents, cracks, or expired dates. Always handle lids carefully to prevent damage. 


### Cost Considerations

Bulk canning lids offer significant cost savings compared to individually packaged lids. Calculate your needs based on the number of jars you plan to preserve each year. While bulk lids are more economical, ensure you purchase enough to last through your canning season. 


## FAQ


### What are canning lids made of?

Canning lids are typically made from two main components: the lid itself and the lid seal compound. The lid is usually aluminum or tin-plated steel. The seal compound, or "ring, " is a thick plastic ring that adheres to the lid and creates an airtight seal when heated during processing. 

The sealing compound contains natural ingredients like rubber and vegetable-based resins that melt when heated, forming a secure seal around the jar's lip. This dual-layer design helps prevent air and bacteria from entering the jar, preserving the food inside. 


### How long do properly sealed canning lids last?

Properly sealed canning lids can maintain their seal for at least one year when stored in a cool, dry place. The food inside a properly sealed jar will typically remain safe to eat for 12-18 months from the date it was canned, assuming proper canning techniques were followed. 

If the lid remains concave (sunken in) and doesn't pop back when pressed, the seal is still intact. However, if the lid pops up and down when pressed or has any signs of damage, the jar should be considered spoiled and not consumed. 


### What's the difference between metal and plastic lids?

While both metal and plastic lids are suitable for home canning, they serve different purposes. Metal lids offer better heat conductivity and are more resistant to warping from temperature changes. They create a more consistent seal and are less likely to crack. 

Plastic lids are lighter, more flexible, and easier to apply. They're ideal for temporary storage or situations where you need to reseal jars multiple times. However, they may not provide the same long-term sealing performance as metal lids and can become brittle over time. 


### Can I reuse canning lids?

It's recommended to use canning lids only once. After processing and cooling, carefully check the lid for a good seal by pressing the center. If the lid pops up and down or has any signs of damage, discard it and use a new lid for the next canning session. 

Reusing lids increases the risk of botulism contamination and can lead to improper sealing, compromising food safety. Always use new lids for each canning session to ensure optimal preservation results. 


### How do I store canning lids properly?

Store unused canning lids in their original containers or in airtight containers to maintain their sealability. Keep them at room temperature in a dry place away from direct sunlight, heat sources, and moisture. Avoid storing lids in the refrigerator or freezer as condensation can affect their integrity. 

Discard lids that are dented, rusty, or show signs of warping. Replace any lids that have been exposed to moisture or damage, as they may no longer form a proper seal during processing. 


### What should I do if a canning lid doesn't seal properly?

If a canning lid doesn't seal properly, refrigerate the food and use it within a week. The food may still be safe to eat, but the lack of a proper seal means it won't keep as long. Avoid storing non-sealed jars at room temperature, as bacteria can potentially grow. 

If you frequently encounter sealing issues, consider adjusting your canning technique. Factors like processing time, temperature, and lid application can affect sealing success. Consult reliable canning resources to identify and correct potential issues.
