## Buyer's Guide

A 12x12 frame is a versatile photography or artwork mounting solution that offers ample space for showcasing your favorite photos or paintings. Understanding the key aspects of this product will help you choose a frame that complements your artwork while meeting your display needs. 


### Frame Basics: Size and Versatility

Dimensions: The standard 12x12 frame measures 12 inches by 12 inches, providing a generous workspace of 10x10 inches for your artwork after framing materials are accounted for. This size works well for both horizontal and vertical orientations. 

Border Options: Modern frames often offer customizable border widths, allowing you to choose between slim-line profiles that minimize visual intrusion and traditional wide borders that add a decorative element to your display. 


### Magnetic Backing: Practicality and Display Flexibility

Installation: Magnetic backing frames require pre-drilling and proper mounting to secure the artwork to the frame. This feature enables easy repositioning and removal of the artwork without damage to the piece being displayed. 

Magnetic Strength: The magnetic strength should exceed the weight of your artwork to ensure secure display. Lighter pieces may only need basic magnets, while heavier works require multiple strong magnets or rare earth magnetic backing. 


### UV Protection: Preserving Your Artwork

UV Filters: Many 12x12 frames include UV protection to prevent fading and degradation of your artwork due to sunlight exposure. Understanding the type and effectiveness of the UV protection helps maintain the quality of your displayed pieces. 

Frame Materials: The frame's material affects UV protection and overall durability. Acrylic and glass provide different levels of protection and visual effects, with acrylic being more resistant to scratching and breaking. 


### Frame Finish: Enhancing Visual Appeal

Matting and Laminating: The choice between matting and laminating depends on the artwork's surface and desired effect. Matting protects delicate surfaces, while laminating provides protection and reduces glare. 

Edge Treatment: Rounding or beveling the frame edges adds a finishing touch that can complement your artwork's style. The edge treatment should match the frame's intended use and environment (indoor vs. outdoor). 


## FAQ


### What is a 12x12 frame?

Our 12x12 frame kit includes all the wood pieces you need to build a 12-foot by 12-foot hexagonal frame. The modular design allows you to customize your structure's height, from a simple ground-supported shelter to a tall gazebo. 

The kit features pressure-treated lumber for durability and includes pre-drilled holes for quick assembly with included screws. Optional roof panels and roofing materials are available separately from local suppliers. 


### What materials are included in the kit?

The kit contains all the wood pieces necessary for the frame, including treated 2x6 ledger boards and hexagonal posts. Pre-drilled holes and countersinks are included for fastening. No tools beyond a hammer and screwdriver are needed for assembly. 

The frame requires connection points for a roof or awning but comes without roofing materials. The included parts are crafted from pressure-treated fir for longevity and fade-resistant exterior-grade paint. 


### How long does it take to assemble?

The frame typically takes 2 to 4 hours to assemble, depending on your familiarity with building projects and the complexity of your design. The modular pieces allow for efficient stacking of frame sections. 

Beginners may need the full 4 hours, while experienced do-it-yourselfers can complete it in just 2 hours. The included instructions detail the assembly process clearly, with most steps requiring minimal tools. 


### What's the weight capacity?

The frame supports up to 100 pounds per square foot of roof area, making it suitable for light to moderate loads. This capacity includes snow, wind, and roofing materials but excludes heavy items like refrigerators or heating equipment. 

For permanent installations or commercial uses, we recommend consulting with a structural engineer. The frame's posts have a 20,000-pound weight capacity per pole, well beyond standard residential loads. 


### Are there different height options?

Yes, the frame height can be adjusted between 6 and 8 feet by selecting different lengths of ledger boards and posts. The modular design allows you to build ground-supported structures or tall gazebos with the same basic pieces. 

The standard 12-foot height requires 15 hexagonal posts and 12 ledger boards. The full height structure has a diameter of 12 feet at ground level, but the actual footprint is 10 feet due to the posts' offset layout. 


### What maintenance is required?

The pressure-treated wood requires minimal maintenance, with regular cleaning and inspection recommended. Every 3-5 years, reapply a quality exterior wood finish to maintain the frame's appearance and protect the wood. 

Check all screws and connections annually for tightness, especially after severe weather events. Replace any damaged or loose parts promptly to maintain the structure's integrity.
