## FAQ


### What is a GHR machine?

A GHR machine, or Gastric Harmonizing Robot, is a medical device designed to help manage symptoms related to acid reflux and other gastrointestinal issues. It works by delivering mild electrical stimulation to the lower esophageal sphincter to improve digestive function. 

The technology aims to reduce the need for medications and irreversible surgical procedures, offering a non-invasive alternative for symptom management. 


### How effective is the GHR machine?

While individual results may vary, clinical studies have shown that the GHR machine can significantly reduce symptoms of acid reflux in many users. Studies published in reputable medical journals have reported success rates between 60-80% for patients who complete the full treatment course. 

Users often report improvements in digestion, reduced heartburn episodes, and enhanced overall quality of life after using the device regularly. 


### Is the GHR machine suitable for everyone?

Most people can use the GHR machine safely, but it's important to consult with a healthcare provider first. The device may not be appropriate for individuals with certain medical conditions, including some forms of heart disease or specific types of gastrointestinal disorders. 

Pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, and individuals with implanted medical devices should avoid using the GHR machine unless specifically cleared by their doctor. 


### What are the potential side effects?

The most common side effects reported by users are mild and temporary. These may include temporary discomfort during treatment, minor skin irritation at the application site, or brief changes in heart rate. 

Severe side effects are rare, but any unusual symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately. Continuous monitoring during your first few treatments is recommended to ensure safety and proper usage. 


### How long does a treatment session take?

A typical GHR treatment session lasts about 20-30 minutes. Most users schedule their sessions 2-3 times per week, following the recommended protocol for best results. 

While the device is in use, users can read, relax, or perform light activities. The treatment can be performed at home, making it convenient for regular use as part of a management plan. 


### What happens during a treatment session?

The GHR machine features adhesive electrodes that adhere to the skin near the lower esophageal sphincter. The device delivers controlled electrical impulses to this area to help regulate digestive function. 

The treatment is generally comfortable, though some users may experience a mild tingling sensation. The healthcare provider will monitor the session to ensure proper placement and adjust the settings if needed.
