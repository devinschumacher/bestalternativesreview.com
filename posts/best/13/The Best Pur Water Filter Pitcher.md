## Buyer's Guide

A pure water filter pitcher transforms tap water into a refreshing, clean drinking experience through an efficient filtration process. These pitchers combine affordability with convenience, making them a popular choice for home water purification. Understanding their key features and capabilities helps in selecting the right pitcher for your water quality and usage needs. 


### Filter Technology

Most water filter pitchers use activated carbon filters, which excel at removing chlorine and improving taste. For better performance against contaminants like lead and mercury, consider pitchers with multi-stage filtration or specialized filters. Understanding the Specific Pollutants your water contains helps in choosing the appropriate filtration technology. 


### Capacity and Flow Rate

Standard capacities range from 1 to 5 gallons, with larger sizes suitable for families or everyday use. Flow rates determine how quickly filtered water passes through the pitcher, with faster rates being more convenient but potentially less effective. Consider how often you need to fill the pitcher when choosing its size. 


### Maintenance Requirements

Filter replacement is crucial for maintaining purity, with most pitchers needing replacement filters every 30 to 60 days based on usage. Cleanability of the pitcher itself varies - some models are dishwasher-safe, while others require manual cleaning to prevent mineral buildup and maintain taste quality. 


### Ergonomics and Design

Ergonomic handles and spill-proof bases enhance usability, making refilling and pouring easier. Pitchers with built-in storage for filters reduce countertop clutter and remind users when replacements are needed. Consider the pitcher's size and shape when comparing designs, as they impact both storage and handling convenience. 


## FAQ


### What is a Pur Water Filter Pitcher?

A Pur Water Filter Pitcher is a countertop water filtration system that removes chlorine, lead, and other contaminants from tap water using activated carbon filtration technology. The pitchers typically have a capacity of 1 or 2 liters and come equipped with replaceable filters that need to be replaced every 40-60 gallons of purified water, depending on usage. 

The pitchers are designed for convenience, offering cold-brew filtration for immediately drinkable water. They sit on the countertop while the water filters through, making them ideal for small apartments or offices where a larger system might be impractical. 


### How does a Pur Water Filter Pitcher work?

The water filter pitcher contains a replaceable carbon filter that removes contaminants through a process called adsorption. As water passes through the filter, the activated carbon attracts and captures chlorine, lead, and other impurities, leaving the water clean and fresh-tasting. 

The filtration process is activated by simply filling the pitcher with tap water and allowing it to sit for several minutes, during which time the water passes through the filter. The filtered water can then be consumed immediately through the pitcher's spout. 


### What contaminants does a Pur Water Filter Pitcher remove?

The Pur Water Filter Pitcher effectively removes a wide range of common water contaminants, including chlorine, lead, and sediment. It also helps reduce other impurities like mercury, cysts, and volatile organic compounds, ensuring the water tastes clear and refreshing. 

While the pitcher significantly improves water quality, it's important to note that it doesn't remove all possible contaminants, particularly minerals and naturally occurring heavy metals. For comprehensive water purification, especially in areas with well-water or severe contamination issues, additional filtration methods may be necessary. 


### How often should I replace the filter?

The filter needs to be replaced every 40-60 gallons of purified water, depending on usage frequency and local water quality. Pur recommends checking the filter indicator light, which changes color when filtration capacity is approaching depletion. 

Regular filter replacement is crucial for maintaining water quality and ensuring proper filtration performance. Using unfiltered water can affect the taste and potentially reintroduce contaminants to your drinking water. 


### How long does a new filter last?

A new filter typically provides clean water for around 40-60 gallons before it needs to be replaced. This can vary based on water hardness, usage frequency, and local water quality. Some filters may last longer in soft water areas with lower pollutant levels, while others may need replacement after fewer gallons in areas with hard water or higher contaminant levels. 

To determine filter life, track your usage and monitor the filter indicator light. It's important to replace the filter regularly to maintain optimal water quality and prevent backflow of contaminated water. 


### What maintenance does a Pur Water Filter Pitcher require?

The pitcher requires minimal maintenance beyond regular filter changes. After each use, empty the remaining water and rinse the pitcher with fresh water to prevent mineral buildup. The filter housing and lid should be hand-washed with mild detergent when visible dirt accumulates. 

Periodically check the filter indicator light and inspect the filter for any visible damage before installation. Proper maintenance ensures the pitcher continues to perform effectively and extends the lifespan of both the filter and the pitcher itself.
