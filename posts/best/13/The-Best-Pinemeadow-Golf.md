## Buyer's Guide

When selecting a Pinemeadow golf cart, several key factors determine suitability and performance. Understanding these aspects helps in choosing the right cart for your needs. 


### Size and Capacity

The cart's dimensions and seating configuration impact both storage and passenger capacity. Consider the number of riders and any equipment that needs to be transported. Standard models typically accommodate 2-4 people, while larger versions can carry more gear and passengers.
