## Buyer's Guide

A floating bedside table creates the illusion of space while providing practical storage. These sleek tables attach to the wall, reducing floor clutter and maximizing room dimensions. Understanding key features and considerations will help you select the perfect floating bedside table for your space. 


### Size and Proportion

The table's dimensions should match your bed's width, typically ranging from 24 to 36 inches in length. Consider the height, usually between 24 and 30 inches, to ensure comfortable reach while sitting or lying down. Proper proportion is crucial for maintaining visual balance in your bedroom.

Storage compartments offer additional value, providing space for books, lamps, and personal items. Common features include drawers, shelves, and open compartments. For enhanced organization, look for tables with adjustable shelves or built-in charging ports for electronic devices. 


### Mounting Mechanisms

Secure mounting is essential for these freestanding tables. The brackets and wall anchors should support at least twice the table's weight. Consider tables with adjustable bracket heights for compatibility with different wall thicknesses. Regular maintenance of the mounting hardware ensures long-term stability. 


### Design and Finishes

Choose a finish that complements your existing furniture and room decor. Common materials include paintedwood, metal, and glass. The table's style should blend with your bedroom's overall aesthetic, whether modern, traditional, or contemporary. 


## FAQ


### What is a floating bedside table?

A floating bedside table appears to hover above the floor, creating an illusion of weightlessness. The design typically features a slim, concealed base that allows the tabletop to sit slightly off the ground. 

This unique style draws attention to its minimalist proportions while providing a practical surface for nighttime essentials. 


### What materials are commonly used in floating bedside tables?

Manufacturers often use engineered wood, MDF, or composite materials for the base to ensure structural stability while maintaining a light appearance. 

The tabletop is usually made from solid wood, glass, or engineered materials like tempered acrylic or composite glass to match the visual weightlessness. 


### How does a floating bedside table contribute to room design?

The distinctive design statement of these tables can dramatically alter the visual balance of a room, making smaller spaces feel more open and airy. 

Their clean lines and simple form offer a sophisticated backdrop for bedroom décor, complementing both contemporary and modern design styles. 


### What maintenance requirements should I consider?

Regular dusting is necessary to keep the surface clean and free of fingerprints. Avoid using abrasive cleaners that could scratch the tabletop material. 

Wipe spills immediately to prevent damage to the surface. Check that the concealed base remains secure and tightly sealed to maintain the floating appearance. 


### Are floating bedside tables suitable for heavy items?

The structural integrity of these tables is compromised when supporting heavier objects, which can cause the base to wobble or become unstable. 

Manufacturers typically specify weight limits for the tabletop. Exceeding these limits can damage the table and compromise your safety. 


### How do I properly install a floating bedside table?

These tables usually arrive with the bottom portion detached from the tabletop for easier transportation. Carefully align the base with the tabletop, then secure it using hidden fasteners provided by the manufacturer. 

Handle the table with both hands and avoid applying excessive pressure to the bottom portion during installation to prevent warping or damage to the concealed base.
