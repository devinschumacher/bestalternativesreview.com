If your baby has dry, sensitive, or eczema-prone skin, choose a formula specifically designed for these conditions. These products often contain additional moisturizing ingredients like colloidal oatmeal and natural emollients. 


### Product Formulation

Baby shampoos should always be free from harsh detergents like sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS). This ingredient can strip the skin of its natural oils and cause irritation. Instead, look for mild surfactants that clean effectively without stripping the skin.

### Application and Rinse-Off

Opt for a formula that lathers slightly but rinses off thoroughly to prevent residue buildup. The shampoo should be gentle enough for daily use and leave your baby's skin feeling clean and refreshed without any residue or heaviness.

### What makes Aveeno Baby Shampoo different from regular baby shampoos?

Aveeno Baby Shampoo contains natural oat extract, which helps soothe sensitive skin and reduce irritation. Unlike some harsher formulas, this gentle cleanser works without artificial colors or harsh chemicals. 

The oat extract in the shampoo helps eliminate dryness while effectively removing dirt and oils, making it ideal for babies with sensitive skin tendencies. 


### Can Aveeno Baby Shampoo be used on other parts of the body?

Yes, while specifically formulated for the scalp, the gentle formula can safely be used to cleanse other areas of the body for your baby. 

However, for the most sensitive areas like facial skin, it's recommended to use a dedicated gentle cleanser to prevent irritation.

### How should Aveeno Baby Shampoo be applied?

Apply a small amount to your hand or directly to your baby's scalp, avoiding the eyes and mouth. Gently massage into a lather before rinsing thoroughly. 

Use warm water for application and ensure all soap residue is removed to prevent dryness or irritation. 


### How often can Aveeno Baby Shampoo be used?

Use daily or as needed for infants and young children. The natural formula makes it safe for frequent use without upsetting the skin's pH balance. 

For babies with chronic dryness or eczema, consult with a dermatologist for personalized advice on usage frequency.

### How long does a typical bottle last?

A 6.7 oz bottle usually lasts 4-6 weeks for daily use, depending on the frequency and size of applications. 

For more extended use or overnight scalp conditions, the bottle may last 2-3 weeks. 


### Is the shampoo suitable for color-treated hair?

Aveeno Baby Shampoo is formulated specifically for babies and is not tested for use on color-treated hair. 

If you're using color treatments on your baby's hair, consult with a pediatric dermatologist for appropriate cleansing products.
