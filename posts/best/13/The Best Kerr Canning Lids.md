## Buyer's Guide

Kerr canning lids are essential for sealing home-canned foods properly. These metal lids create an airtight seal when used with the correct band and lid combination. They come in different sizes to match standard canning jars and are made from tin-plated steel for durability. 


### Size Selection

Choose the right lid size based on your jar's neck diameter. Common sizes include #1 (for half-pint and pint jars), #2 (for quarts), and #2.5 (for specialty jars). Each size has a corresponding sealing surface area to ensure proper closure. 


### Storage and Handling

Store canning lids in a single layer at room temperature to maintain their sealing effectiveness. Avoid stacking them, which can damage the sealing compound. Before use, place lids in warm water for 2-3 minutes to activate the sealing compound, but do not completely cover them while soaking. 


### Sealing Process

After placing prepared food in a clean jar, wipe the rim and threads free of food debris. Position the lid with the convex side up, then screw on the lid-using a jar lifter or tongs-to ensure even pressure. Process the jar according to recipe guidelines, typically applying additional pressure if required by your pressure canner model. 


### Evaluation and Usage

Check sealed lids for signs of proper sealing, such as the center being concave and showing no movement when pressed. If in doubt, store unsealed jars in the refrigerator and use within a week. Always test the seal before serving or storing canned goods, as unsealed jars should be refrigerated and used first. 


## FAQ


### What makes Kerr canning lids different from other sealing options?

Kerr canning lids are specifically designed for home canning, featuring a specialized sealing compound that creates an airtight seal when properly processed. Unlike resealable containers, these lids are designed to be used once and then discarded. 

Each lid includes a separate rubber gasket ring that presses against the jar's edge during the sealing process, creating an effective seal that helps prevent spoilage and maintains food quality. 


### How do I properly store opened jars with Kerr canning lids?

After opening a jar, remove the lid and rubber gasket ring. While the jar remains sealed, it can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. Discard any unused contents after this time. 

For longer storage, it's recommended to transfer the food to a clean container with a tight-fitting lid, then refrigerate or freeze as appropriate for the food type. 


### Can I reuse Kerr canning lids?

No, Kerr canning lids are designed for single-use only. Reusing them can compromise the seal and potentially lead to food spoilage. 

The rubber gasket ring needs to be completely removed after each use to prevent bacteria growth and maintain hygiene standards. 


### What's the best way to clean Kerr canning lids?

After use, place the rubber gasket ring in a pot of hot, soapy water and simmer for 2-3 minutes. This helps remove residue and prepares the ring for the next use. 

Use a clean dish brush to gently scrub the ring, then rinse thoroughly before allowing it to air dry completely. Store in a clean container until ready for the next canning session. 


### Are Kerr canning lids dishwasher safe?

While the rubber gasket rings can be placed in the dishwasher, it's recommended to hand wash them for better cleaning results and to prevent damage to the rubber. 

Hand washing allows for more thorough cleaning, especially important given the critical role these rings play in creating an airtight seal. 


### How do I know if a Kerr canning lid has sealed properly?

After processing, allow jars to cool to room temperature. Press the center of the lid - if it doesn't move, the seal has formed successfully. 

Vapor rings may appear on the lid when it's sealed properly. If there's no visible ring or the lid moves when pressed, the jar needs to be refrigerated and the contents used within 24 hours.
