## Buyer's Guide

Affresh Dishwasher Cleaner products help maintain your dishwasher by removing residue and preventing buildup. These specialized cleaners can improve washing performance and extend the life of your appliance. 


### Powder vs. Gel Formulas

Affresh offers both powdered and gel formulas. Powdered cleaners typically cost less and are more widely available. Gel cleaners dissolve more quickly and distribute better in the dishwasher, making them efficient for tough stains. 


### Residue Removal Capacity

The most effective Affresh cleaners remove residue from dishes and the dishwasher interior. Look for products that specifically state their ability to dissolve soap scum, food particles, and hard water deposits. 


### Pre-rinse Requirements

Some Affresh cleaners require you to pre-rinse dishes before use. Others can be added directly to the dishwasher without pre-rinsing. Consider your convenience preferences when selecting a product. 


### Environmental Impact

Affresh products vary in their environmental friendliness. Some formulas contain harsh chemicals, while others are biodegradable or plant-based. Consider your eco-consciousness when choosing a cleaner.
