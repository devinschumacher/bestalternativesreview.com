## Buyer's Guide

A mat board cutter is an essential tool for creating professional-grade matting and mounting projects. Understanding the key features and proper usage techniques will help you select the right tool and achieve accurate cuts every time. 


### Types of Mat Board Cutters

Matt board cutters come in three primary types: straight edge, V-cut, and specialized. Straight edge cutters are suitable for making clean cuts across the full width of the mat board. V-cutters create a slight angle that prevents the cut piece from rolling, ideal for detailed or intricate designs. Specialized cutters include combination tools with interchangeable blades for different cut depths and angles. 


### Key Features to Consider

Important features include blade type and quality, material durability, and adjustability. High-carbon steel blades maintain their sharpness longer than alternative materials. Durable, robust construction ensures the tool withstands regular use without bending or warping. Adjustability allows for modifying the cutting angle or depth based on the project requirements. 


### Usage and Maintenance

Proper usage techniques include regular blade sharpening, maintaining consistent pressure, and using the appropriate cutting angle for the desired effect. After each use, clean the blade with a soft cloth and store the cutter in a protective case to prevent damage. Regular maintenance includes checking for blade wear and replacing when necessary. 


### Selecting the Right Size

Mat board cutters are available in various lengths, from 12 inches to 36 inches. The appropriate size depends on your work requirements. Smaller cutters are suitable for basic matting projects, while larger cutters accommodate sheet matting and commercial projects. Consider the maximum mat board thickness the cutter can handle when selecting a size. 


## FAQ


### What is a mat board cutter?

A mat board cutter is specialized equipment designed for precise cutting of mat board, a rigid substrate commonly used in framing and mounting artwork. These cutters feature sharp blades housed in a durable frame, allowing users to make clean, professional cuts with minimal effort. 

Most mat board cutters include interchangeable blades for different thicknesses of mat board, adjustable guides for consistent cuts, and protective features to prevent accidents. 


### What types of mat board cutters are available?

Mat board cutters come in manual and power-driven varieties. Manual cutters are portable and ideal for occasional use, while power cutters offer faster processing for larger quantities of material. 

Power cutters typically include variable speed controls, dust collection systems, and blade guides to enhance precision and efficiency. 


### How do you use a mat board cutter?

To use a mat board cutter, first secure the mat board in a stable position. Adjust the blade guide to the desired width, then lower the blade until it's just touching the board. Apply steady pressure and pull the blade along the guide for a straight cut. 

For curved or intricate cuts, consider using specialized cutting templates or a manual cutting wheel attachment. 


### What's the difference between mat board and other cutting materials?

Mat board is rigid, lightweight, and comes in various thicknesses. It's primarily used for mounting and framing artwork, while other cutting materials like foam core or corrugated board have different properties and applications. 

Foam core is more flexible and suitable for quick prototyping or lightweight projects, while corrugated board provides superior structural support for heavy or framed items. 


### How long do mat board cutters last?

With proper maintenance, a high-quality mat board cutter can last 5-10 years. The lifespan depends on usage frequency, blade quality, and adherence to maintenance guidelines. 

Regular blade inspection, prompt cleaning after each use, and replacement of worn parts are essential for maintaining optimal performance and longevity. 


### How do you maintain a mat board cutter?

Clean the blade and cutting surface after each use to prevent debris buildup and maintain blade sharpness. For power cutters, ensure dust collection filters are clean and regularly check motor belts for wear. 

Store the cutter in a dry place when not in use, and periodically lubricate moving parts according to the manufacturer's instructions to prevent rust and maintain smooth operation.
