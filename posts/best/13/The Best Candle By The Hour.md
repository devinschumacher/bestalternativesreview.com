### What is a Candle By The Hour?

Candle by the hour is a pricing model where the cost of a candle is calculated based on how long it burns. This allows consumers to purchase candles in smaller, more manageable increments, rather than committing to a full-priced option that might not suit their immediate needs. 

The pricing typically varies by brand and product type, with smaller burn times costing less than longer-burning alternatives. This allows for flexibility in usage, whether for quick room freshening or longer-lasting ambient lighting. 


### How Does Burn Time Impact Pricing?

Burn time is directly correlated with cost in candle by the hour pricing. A candle that burns for 30 hours at a base price may cost less per hour than a longer-burning counterpart due to economies of scale in manufacturing and packaging. 

The pricing structure often includes a tiered system where bulk purchases offer discounts per hour of burn time, incentivizing customers to use larger amounts of product while keeping individual hours affordable. 

![Candle-By-The-Hour-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Candle-By-The-Hour-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What Common Sizes Might I Encounter?

Sizes typically range from 1 to 4 hours of burn time, though some premium brands offer even shorter increments for travel or specific applications. The most common sizes fall between 1-3 hours. 

Package quantities usually come in sets of 12-hour increments, allowing for variety in usage while maintaining consistent pricing metrics. 


### Are These Candles Suitable for Travel?

Smaller 1-2 hour candles are ideal for travel due to their compact size and efficiency. These shorter-burning candles fit easily into luggage and provide immediate ambiance without lengthy commitments. 

While they work well for travel, users should note that they won't last as long as larger candles for extended use in a single location. 

![Candle-By-The-Hour-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Candle-By-The-Hour-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What Types of Scents Are Available?

Scent options vary widely by brand, but common categories include vanilla, lavender, and citrus. Some brands also offer seasonal and holiday-specific scents. 

Scent intensity and type can affect perceived value, with more potent scents allowing for longer-burning candles while subtler scents may need more frequent use. 


### How Do I Determine the Best Size for My Needs?

Calculate your required usage time and compare to available sizes. For daily lighting, a 3-4 hour candle might be ideal. Occasional use can accommodate longer 9-12 hour candles. 

Consider whether you need immediate effect (shorter candles) or sustained ambiance (longer candles), and choose sizes that align with these needs for optimal value.
