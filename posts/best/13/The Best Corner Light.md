## Buyer's Guide

Corner lights transform functional architectural elements into inviting highlights, effectively expanding the perceived size and openness of a room. These fixtures channel illumination into tight corners where traditional lights struggle to reach, creating dramatic effects and practical solutions for space optimization. 


### Photometry and Light Output

Corner lights come with specific lumens ratings tailored to their purpose. A general rule is to select fixtures with 20-30 lumens per square foot for basic room illumination, increasing this ratio for darker corners or higher ceiling heights. Consider fixtures that offer adjustable beam angles to direct light precisely where it's needed while managing glare and overspill. 

![Corner-Light-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Corner-Light-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Material and Construction Quality

Invest in fixtures made from durable materials like die-cast aluminum for better heat dissipation and longer service life. The construction quality should match or exceed that of your home's existing fixtures. Pay attention to connections between the housing and lens to ensure they're secure and resistant to vibration over time. 


### Color Temperature and Light Source Compatibility

Color temperature influences how corners appear by affecting color rendering and atmosphere. Warm white (2700-3000K) creates intimate, cozy spaces, while cool white (3500-4100K) provides alertness and clarity. Ensure the fixture's voltage rating matches your electrical system and consider options that accept LED bulbs if you're upgrading or want flexibility. 

![Corner-Light-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Corner-Light-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Installation Requirements and Technical Specifications

Check the fixture's weight rating to match ceiling thickness and support capacity. Understand the mounting requirements, including box depth and mounting depth, to fit your space properly. Pay attention to cord lengths and termination options for wall or surface-mount installations. Standardizing voltage compatibility (120V in the US) simplifies selection and reduces potential hazards. 


## FAQ

![Corner-Light-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Corner-Light-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a corner light?

A corner light is a specialized lighting fixture designed to illuminate tight corners, such as those found between walls and furniture or in narrow hallways. These fixtures provide targeted illumination to previously dark areas, enhancing both functionality and aesthetics. 

Corner lights come in various designs, including surface-mounted, flush-mount, and recessed options, allowing installation in different architectural settings. They are available in a range of color temperatures and styles to match various interior design preferences. 


### Where should I install a corner light?

Install corner lights in areas where natural light doesn't reach fully, such as inside cabinets, between furniture pieces, or in small hallways. They're particularly useful near stairwell Landings or in corners of living rooms and bedrooms. 

Avoid installing corner lights directly over beds or dining tables. Instead, position them to light pathways or highlight architectural elements. The optimal installation height depends on the specific fixture and room size. 

![Corner-Light-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Corner-Light-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the main types of corner lights?

The primary types of corner lights include surface-mounted fixtures, flush-mount options, and recessed cans. Surface-mounted lights project slightly above the ceiling plane, providing full illumination of the corner. Flush-mount fixtures sit completely flat against the ceiling, while recessed cans sit within the ceiling cavity and extend only slightly outward. 

Design-wise, corner lights range from simple boxy fixtures to more decorative options with unique shapes. Some feature diffused glass or acrylic elements, while others incorporate LED strip technology for softer, more indirect lighting. 


### How much light do corner lights produce?

Typically, corner lights range from 15 to 30 watts, producing between 150 to 600 lumens. The exact output depends on the bulb type and fixture design. Higher-wattage options and fixtures with larger reflectors produce more light. 

Most corner lights come with standard 6-inch reflectors, but extending these can increase light output. For brighter corners, consider fixtures with wider reflectors or additional bulbs. Always verify the light output matches your space's needs. 

![Corner-Light-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Corner-Light-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do I choose the right bulb for my corner light?

When selecting a bulb for a corner light, consider the fixture's voltage rating, reflector size, and the specific luminaire type. Common bulb options include A19 LED bulbs, Candelabra bulbs, and specialty LED bulbs designed for specific light patterns. 

Color temperature is crucial: Ranging from warm (2700K) to cool (5000K), the right temperature affects both the mood and functionality of the space. Consider the room's purpose (warm tones for bedroom, cooler tones for office). 


### How do I install a corner light?

Installation typically requires basic tools like a screwdriver, voltage tester, and possibly a helper. Start by turning off power at the circuit breaker, testing with a voltage tester to ensure it's off, and removing existing fixtures if applicable. 

For surface-mounted and flush-mount fixtures, follow these steps: measure and mark the mounting location, drill pilot holes, attach mounting plates, wire connections, install the light fixture, and screw on the cover plate. Recessed cans require specific electrical boxes and proper insulation clearance.
