This compact Rapala holder keeps your Dipsy Diver safely stored when you're not using it, with its durable composite construction and 3M adhesive backing making it easy to mount anywhere on your boat or in your garage. The slightly slim design sacrifices a bit of impact resistance for the practical benefit of saving space - still, at 9.8 inches tall and 8.1 inches wide, it's not going anywhere when you stow it away.

## FAQ

![Dipsy-Diver-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Dipsy-Diver-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a Dipsy Diver?

A Dipsy Diver is a specialized piece of fishing tackle designed to retrieve artificial lures and baits through the water in a tandem, oscillating motion. This unique retrieval pattern mimics the natural movements of baitfish, making it an effective tool for attracting predatory fish. 

The system consists of a mainline rig with multiple Dipsy Diver units attached, each capable of carrying multiple lures or baits. These units work in tandem to produce multiple points of action, increasing the effectiveness of thepresentation. 


### How does a Dipsy Diver work?

The Dipsy Diver system utilizes a mainline rig with multiple units that oscillate independently while maintaining proper distance from each other. Each unit features a weighted base that keeps it stable at depth while allowing the attached lures to move naturally in the water column. 

The retrieval action creates a distinctive wobble and horizontal movement that resembles injured or stressed baitfish, triggering strikes from predatory species. 

![Dipsy-Diver-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Dipsy-Diver-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What types of fishing applications are Dipsy Divers suitable for?

Dipsy Divers excel in open water fishing for major game fish species such as tuna, wahoo, and dorado. They are particularly effective in offshore environments where trolling for pelagic species is common. 

The system can be used year-round in various water conditions, making it a versatile tool for both inshore and offshore anglers targeting multiple species. 


### How do I properly set up and rig a Dipsy Diver system?

Begin by selecting appropriate Dipsy Diver units based on the water depth and desired spread between lures. Attach the mainline rig to your fishing rod, ensuring proper weight distribution and correct distance between each diver unit. 

Each Dipsy Diver unit should be rigged with appropriate lures or baits based on target species and local fishing conditions. Proper rigging ensures optimal performance and reduces tangles during retrieval. 

![Dipsy-Diver-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Dipsy-Diver-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What maintenance and care requirements do Dipsy Divers have?

Regular inspection of Dipsy Diver units is essential to ensure proper functioning. Check weights, swivels, and guides for wear and tear, and replace any damaged components before each fishing trip. 

When not in use, store Dipsy Diver units in a protective case to prevent damage from hooks, line, and environmental factors. Proper maintenance extends the lifespan of your equipment and ensures reliable performance. 


### Are Dipsy Divers legal in all fishing jurisdictions?

The legal status of Dipsy Diver usage varies by location. Some coastal areas restrict or prohibit their use due to environmental concerns or competitive fishing regulations. 

Always check local fishing regulations before using Dipsy Diver equipment. Understanding jurisdictional requirements ensures compliance and prevents potential conflicts on the water.
