Amana water filters effectively remove chlorine, mercury, cysts, and other common water contaminants. They also reduce heavy metals, sediments, and other impurities to deliver clean, great-tasting water. 

The filtering process uses a combination of activated carbon and filter media layers to trap these impurities, ensuring your drinking water meets high-quality standards.

Installation typically requires basic tools like a wrench and usually takes 10-15 minutes. The process involves turning off the water supply, disconnecting the old filter, and installing the new filter in its designated spot. 

Follow the specific instructions provided with your filter model, as installation procedures can vary slightly between different filter designs. 


### How long does an Amana water filter last?

The lifespan of an Amana water filter depends on your water quality and usage. Under normal conditions, filters typically last 6-12 months or when the filter indicator light changes from green to red. 

Regular filter replacement ensures continued water quality and prevents potential degradation of water taste and performance.
