## Buyer's Guide

Choosing the right Owlet baby monitor involves considering several key factors to ensure you get the features that best match your needs. This guide will help you understand the important aspects to evaluate when selecting an Owlet monitor. 


### Display Quality and Size

The display is your primary interface with the monitor, so consider the screen size and resolution that feels most practical for your viewing situation. Most Owlet monitors offer color displays with clear visuals, but the screen's placement and visibility should also factor into your selection.

### Audio and Video Features

Audio quality should allow you to hear your baby clearly from a distance. Look for monitors with bidirectional audio so you can soothe your baby if needed. Video features vary by model, with some offering HD quality. Consider whether you need continuous monitoring or just occasional checks. 


### Range and Connectivity

Monitor range typically extends up to 100 feet indoors with clear line-of-sight. Check how the monitor performs in your specific home layout. Some models also offer app connectivity for remote viewing, which requires sufficient smartphone compatibility and data plan consideration.

### Battery Life and Power Options

Battery life varies by model, with some offering up to 12 hours on a charge. Consider whether you need a monitor that runs constantly or can be charged overnight. Power options range from USB charging to replaceable batteries, so choose based on your convenience and usage patterns. 


## FAQ

![Owlet-Baby-Monitor-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Owlet-Baby-Monitor-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is the Owlet Baby Monitor?

The Owlet Baby Monitor combines a smart sleep monitor with a parent alert system to help you keep an eye on your baby's health and sleep patterns. It features oxygen saturation monitoring, heart rate tracking, and parental app notifications for restlessness or crying. 

The monitor also includes a webcam for video surveillance, two-way audio communication, and wireless temperature monitoring. Parents can view real-time data and historical sleep patterns through the dedicated mobile app. 


### What age range is the Owlet Baby Monitor suitable for?

The Owlet Baby Monitor is designed for newborns through 24 months of age. It can be worn starting at 15 days old and can track up to 24 months of data in the app. 

While the monitor works for babies as young as 15 days, we recommend waiting until your baby is at least 2 weeks old for optimal performance and battery life. 

![Owlet-Baby-Monitor-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Owlet-Baby-Monitor-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How accurate is the heart rate and oxygen monitoring?

The Owlet monitor uses proven medical-grade technology for its heart rate and oxygen saturation monitoring. It has been clinically validated to be accurate for its age range and is worn like a sock for easy, non-invasive monitoring. 

While the readings are highly accurate, it's important to note that they should not replace professional medical advice. Always consult with a healthcare provider for any health concerns. 


### Can the monitor's features be used simultaneously?

The Owlet monitor allows you to use multiple features simultaneously, including heart rate, oxygen saturation, temperature monitoring, and video surveillance. However, the camera and two-way audio features require a stable internet connection to stream live video to the parent app. 

When internet connectivity is poor or unavailable, the heart rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature features will continue to work offline, syncing data when the connection is restored. 

![Owlet-Baby-Monitor-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Owlet-Baby-Monitor-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How long does the monitor's battery last?

The Owlet monitor's battery provides approximately 10-14 hours of continuous use on a single charge, depending on the features in use. The monitor uses less power when only the heart rate and oxygen monitoring are active. 

When the battery is low, the monitor will notify both the parent app and the baby's monitor. A full charge takes about 2 hours using the included USB charger. 


### What is the monitor's range and signal strength?

The Owlet monitor has a range of up to 100 feet indoors with line-of-sight, and up to 250 feet with an included repeater. The signal strength is reliable for most home layouts, including those with multiple floors and thick walls. 

When the signal gets weaker, the monitor will notify both the parent app and the baby's monitor. The monitor also includes an LED signal strength indicator that shows battery level and connectivity status.
