## Buyer's Guide

Moonstone engagement rings combine natural beauty with the romantic allure of the night sky. Understanding their unique properties and considerations can help you find a ring that matches your style and preferences. 


### Setting and Clarity

Moonstone is typically found in prong or bezel settings to protect its delicate six-sided crystal structure. The stone's natural sheen, known as adularescence, requires protection from scratches and everyday wear. Opt for a setting with good girdle protection and a secure prong design to maintain the stone's brilliance. 


### Color and Quality

Moonstone comes in various shades, with blue and silver hues being the most common and valuable. The intensity and evenness of the stone's color are key factors in its quality. The best moonstones display a uniform bluish-white sheen throughout the stone rather than just on the surface. 


### Care Requirements

Moonstone is relatively soft at 6-6.5 on the Mohs scale, making it more susceptible to scratches than harder gemstones. Regular cleaning with mild soap and warm water helps maintain its brilliance. Store the ring separately from other jewelry to prevent scratches and damage during cleaning. 


### Setting Options

Classic solitaire settings highlight moonstone's natural beauty, while multi-stone designs can create striking contrast with colored metals. Consider a simple gold band for a timeless look, or choose a white metal setting to enhance the stone's blue tones. The setting should complement the stone's size and color for the best visual impact. 


## FAQ


### What is Moonstone?

Moonstone is a type of feldspar that exhibits a subtle, pearly iridescence. This gemstone gets its name from its lunar glow, which appears to float over its surface like moonlight on water. 

The stone's optical properties are due to a phenomenon called adularescence, where light entering the stone is scattered between layers of feldspar, creating a mesmerizing play of colors and luminosity. 


### Where is Moonstone Sourced?

Moonstone is found in various locations around the world, including India, Brazil, Canada, and Madagascar. Most commercial moonstone comes from Sri Lanka, particularly the town of Ratnapura, known as the "jewelry capital of Sri Lanka. "

Due to its popularity, moonstone is also found in synthetic and treatment forms, though natural, untreated moonstone remains the most valuable and sought-after variety. 


### What Are the Most Common Moonstone Shapes?

Moonstone is typically cut into ovals or pears to enhance its natural brilliance and maximize its floating light effect. However, it can also be found in rounds, emerald cuts, and other fancy shapes, with each cut style highlighting different aspects of the stone's beauty. 

Due to its relatively soft hardness (2-3 on the Mohs scale), moonstone is best set in protective cuts that prevent damage, especially when using bezel or prong settings. 


### How Should Moonstone Be Cleaned?

Clean your moonstone ring with mild soap and warm water regularly to maintain its brilliance. This simple cleaning method is safe for daily wear and removes surface oils and debris that can dull the stone's appearance. 

Avoid harsh chemicals, ultrasonic cleaners, and steam cleaning, as these can damage the stone's delicate surface. Store moonstone jewelry separately to prevent scratches and ensure it's completely dry before wearing.
