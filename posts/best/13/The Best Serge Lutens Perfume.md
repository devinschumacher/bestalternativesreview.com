## FAQ


### What makes Serge Lutens perfume different from other luxury fragrances?

### Are Serge Lutens perfumes suitable for all skin types?

Proper storage is crucial for preserving the quality of Serge Lutens perfumes. Keep bottles away from direct sunlight, heat sources, and extreme temperatures. The optimal storage temperature is between 65-75Â°F (18-24Â°C). 

When storing multiple perfumes, group them together in a cool, dark place to maintain consistency in their volatile chemical compounds. The original packaging provides the best protection against light and temperature changes.

### How long does a Serge Lutens perfume last?

The longevity of Serge Lutens perfumes varies based on the formula but generally lasts 6-8 hours on the skin. Factors affecting duration include environmental conditions, how the fragrance is applied, and the individual's body chemistry.
