## Buyer's Guide

The Eureka Mighty Mite 3670g represents a class of powerful vacuum cleaners that blend impressive suction with compact design. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the right vacuum for your cleaning needs. 


### Vacuum Performance and Suction Power

Performance is primarily determined by suction power, measured in watts. Higher wattage indicates greater suction capability. Look for at least 1200 watts for efficient cleaning of dirt and debris. 

The motor type affects power delivery. Brushless motors are more efficient and powerful, while standard motors may struggle with tougher cleaning tasks. 


### Attachments and Tool Accessories

Versatile attachments increase cleaning utility. Essential accessories include motorized brushes for carpets, crevice tools for tight spaces, and dusting brushes for delicate surfaces. 

The wand length and swivel capabilities impact maneuverability. Longer wands offer more reach, while swivel heads reduce tangle-prone cables. 


### Filter Systems and Efficiency

Filter quality determines both suction maintenance and cleaning effectiveness. HEPA filters capture fine particles, while washable filters provide cost-efficiency with regular cleaning. 

Check the filtration capacity for both primary and secondary filters to ensure efficient particle capture and minimal suction loss. 


### Operational Features and Convenience

Suction control options allow adjustment for different cleaning surfaces. Auto-idle features maintain consistent suction while changing vacuum height. 

Lightweight construction and ergonomic designs improve user comfort during extended use. Consider the vacuum's balance and handle design for steady handling. 


## FAQ


### What makes the Eureka Mighty Mite 3670g unique?

The Mighty Mite 3670g combines powerful suction with compact design, making it ideal for tackling pet hair and dust in tight spaces. Unlike some larger vacuums, this model doesn't sacrifice performance for portability. 

Key features include a 14-foot hose with motorized brushes, five-stage filtration system, and flexible crevice tool. However, the slim design allows it to navigate under furniture while maintaining strong suction power. 


### How effective is the filtration system?

The five-stage filtration system captures 99.9% of particles as small as 0.3 microns, including allergens, dust mites, and pet dander. This ensures clean air while extracting dirt and debris. 

Each stage progressively removes larger particles, with the final HEPA filter capturing fine pollutants. The system helps maintain the vacuum's efficiency and reduces the need for frequent filter replacements. 


### How much maintenance does it require?

Regular maintenance includes emptying the dust cup, checking the filter, and cleaning the motorized brushes monthly. The HEPA filter should be replaced every 6-12 months depending on usage and local air quality. 

Users report that basic maintenance significantly extends the vacuum's lifespan and maintains its performance. The compact design makes it easy to store cleaning tools and access maintenance points. 


### What's the noise level compared to larger vacuums?

At 70 dB, it's notably quieter than many comparable vacuums while still delivering powerful suction. The motorized brushheads run at 13,000 RPM, allowing for efficient cleaning without excessive noise. 

The brushless motor technology and efficient filtration system reduce operational noise compared to older models. Most users find it suitable for nighttime cleaning without disturbing household members or pets. 


### How long does the battery last?

The 12-volt battery provides up to 40 minutes of uninterrupted use on a single charge, which is standard for similarly powerful cordless vacuums. The battery is rechargeable via the included AC adapter. 

To maximize battery life, users should avoid complete discharge and store the vacuum with a partially charged battery. The LED indicator shows charge level, and the vacuum automatically powers off when the battery reaches 20%. 


### Is it suitable for pets with sensitive allergies?

Yes, the deep-hepa filtration system removes 99.9% of airborne particles, including pet dander and allergens. The motorized brushheads lift pet hair effectively while keeping allergens contained. 

Users with severe allergies report significant improvement in symptoms when using this vacuum regularly. The compact design allows for thorough cleaning of pet areas without disturbing sleep or daily routines.
