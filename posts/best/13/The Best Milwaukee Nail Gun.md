## Buyer's Guide

Milwaukee nail guns streamline flooring and construction projects, driving nails quickly and accurately. Understanding key features helps select the right tool for your needs. 


### Energy Source

Milwaukee nail guns use either compressed air (pneumatic) or electrical power (corded or cordless). Pneumatic guns are powerful but require air compression, while corded electric guns offer consistent power but need access to an outlet. Cordless guns provide flexibility with battery power but have limited runtime. 


### Nail Capacity and Magazine Design

Magazine capacity ranges from 10 to 30 nails, with larger capacities for professional use. Single-stack magazines are simpler, while double-stack designs maximize nail storage. Some models feature quick-access nail trays for convenient reloading. 


### Trigger Mechanisms

Most Milwaukee nail guns use conventional triggers, but some models offer progressive triggers for better control. The best triggers provide consistent nail placement and prevent multiple shots without resetting. 


### Charging and Power Management

Cordless models measure nail gun capacity in watt-hours, with higher capacities delivering more shots. Opt for tools with built-in battery health monitoring to track performance. Some models include power management features to extend runtime and prevent overheating. 


## FAQ

Milwaukee offers a variety of nail guns, including framing nail guns, finish nail guns, and coil nail guns. The selection includes both single-shot and magazine-fed options for different applications. 

The most popular models are the M18 Fuel line, which combines high power with long runtime, and the hammer-duty models for heavy-duty construction work.

### How much power do Milwaukee nail guns have?

Milwaukee nail guns deliver significant power for their class, with the M18 Fuel line typically offering 1,100 foot-pounds of hammer energy. This is suitable for 3/4-inch construction nails and 16-gauge wire nailing. 

The hammer-duty models provide up to 1,700 foot-pounds of energy, making them the most powerful in the lineup for heavy-duty applications like residential construction and metalwork. 


### What is the nail gun magazine capacity?

The standard magazine capacity for Milwaukee nail guns ranges from 15 to 32 nails. The M18 Fuel models typically offer 32-nail capacity, while hammer-duty models may have 15-nail clips for convenience in tight spaces. 

For extended magazine options, Milwaukee offers 60-nail magazines on their hammer-duty models and 40-nail magazines for the X2 series, providing more shots per magazine change. 


### How long do Milwaukee nail gun magazines last?

Milwaukee's nail gun magazines, when properly maintained, can last for thousands of nail firings. The 32-nail magazine in their X2 series typically lasts several thousand firings with regular use. 

The company recommends checking magazine condition after 1,000 firings. For best performance, replace magazines showing signs of wear, such as misfeeding or uneven nail ejection. 


### What type of maintenance do Milwaukee nail guns need?

Basic maintenance includes cleaning the hammer assembly and contact pawl after every 1,000 firings. The contact pawl should be replaced when it shows signs of wear, such as not disengaging properly. 

For the nail feed mechanism, clean the drive plate and feed pawl after 2,500 firings, or whenever feeding becomes difficult. Replace the feed pawl when it shows noticeable wear or distortion.
