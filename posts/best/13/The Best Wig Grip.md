## Buyer's Guide

**Selecting the right wig grip can significantly enhance your styling experience and product longevity. These small but important accessories lock your wig to your scalp or wig cap, preventing movement and ensuring a secure fit. Understanding the key aspects of wig grips helps you choose the most suitable type and quantity for your needs.** 


### Types of Wig Grips

Wig grips come in two primary varieties: clips and adhesives. Clips, including clip-in attachments and magnetic closures, offer quick and easy application, making them ideal for casual wear or styling changes throughout the day. Adhesives provide a stronger hold and come in forms like gel, tape, and clips with sticky backing, suitable for formal events or extended wear situations. 


### Application Considerations

The application method depends on your hair type and intended wear time. For fine hair or shorter styles, adhesive grips may offer better hold. Individuals with thicker hair might prefer clips or magnets for secure attachment. The length of the styling session also influences your choice: adhesives work best for formal events, while clips are practical for daily use. 


### Comfort and Hair Damage

Both clip and adhesive styles have potential drawbacks regarding comfort and hair damage. Clips can cause friction and marks if worn for long periods. Adhesives, particularly gel-based products, might be uncomfortable for extended wear and can damage hair over time. Premium adhesive products with lower residue formulas and adjustable clip designs can minimize these issues. 


### Pairing with Hair Products

The effectiveness of wig grips combines with your existing hair care routine. Products that alter scalp pH, such as certain styling gels or hair dyes, can affect grip adhesives' effectiveness. Additionally, hair that has been recently professionally treated or colored might require specific adhesive products to maintain proper adhesion. 


## FAQ


### What is Wig Grip?

Wig Grip is a specialized holding solution designed to secure human hairpieces and wigs in place. It consists of two parts: a suction cup base and a locking ring that attaches to wigs or hairpieces. 

The system provides a customizable grip level, from light to firm hold, making it suitable for various hairpiece styles and applications, including formal occasions, cosplay, and everyday wear. 


### How does Wig Grip work?

The set includes a suction cup base that adheres to surfaces like glass, mirrors, and smooth walls. The locking ring clips onto the base and locks in place, securely attaching it to the wig or hairpiece. 

By adjusting the clip's positioning and tightness, users can achieve the desired hold strength. The system's design allows quick application and removal, making it convenient for frequent placement and relocation. 


### What types of hairpieces can use Wig Grip?

The holding system is compatible with most human hairpieces, including weaves, extensions, and full wigs. It works best on hairpieces with secure, well-fitted bases or attached clip attachments. 

For best results, the hairpiece should be professionally installed with a secure foundation, either through adhesives or clips. This ensures even distribution of the grip's hold across the entire hairpiece. 


### How long does a Wig Grip hold?

With a proper surface and secure hairpiece base, Wig Grip provides a reliable hold for several hours. Factors affecting hold time include surface type, hairpiece quality, and environmental conditions. 

The system typically remains secure through daily activities and light exercise. For extended wear in challenging environments, users may need to periodically check and readjust the hold. 


### What surfaces work best with Wig Grip?

Wig Grip performs best on smooth, clean surfaces like glass, mirrors, and smooth paint. It works well on most indoor surfaces but may not adhere effectively to rough textures, porous materials, or surfaces with coatings. 

The system requires a clean, dry surface for optimal adhesion. Surfaces with irregular textures, coatings, or loose particles may not provide sufficient holding power. 


### How do I maintain Wig Grip?

To maintain the system's performance, regularly inspect the suction cup base for any damage or debris. Clean the base and surfaces it adheres to with mild soap and water, making sure both surfaces are completely dry before use. 

Avoid exposing the system to extreme temperatures, as this can affect the suction cup's integrity. Store the pieces in a dry place when not in use to prevent damage from moisture or humidity.
