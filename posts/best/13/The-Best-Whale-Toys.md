Modern whale toys strive for realistic design, with many featuring accurate proportions and detailed features like realistic fins, tail flukes, and blowholes. Some toys even include educational elements like correct coloring patterns or species-specific details.

Always follow the manufacturer's cleaning instructions, as some toys may require special care methods or specific cleaning products to maintain their quality and appearance.
