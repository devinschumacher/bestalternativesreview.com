## Buyer's Guide

Air purifiers equipped with Oxypure technology represent a significant advancement in indoor air quality solutions. These devices employ a combination of powerful filtration and oxidation processes to eliminate airborne contaminants. Understanding their key features and benefits will help you choose the right model for your home or office. 


### Core Oxypure Technology Components

Look for air purifiers that incorporate catalytic oxidation and photocatalytic reactions into their filtration system. The catalytic converter breaks down pollutants through a chemical reaction, while the photocatalyst activates under ultraviolet light to enhance decomposition efficiency. These processes work together to address a wide range of airborne contaminants including VOCs, odors, and bacteria. 


### Performance Metrics

Key specifications to consider include CADR ratings for smoke, particles, and pollen; air purification capacity measured in cubic meters per hour (m³/h); and filter efficiency classifications such as H13 for particle removal. Additionally, check the machine's noise level during operation, which should remain under 60 decibels for background use in living spaces. 


### Size and Space Considerations

Select a purifier with appropriate dimensions for your room size, ensuring it can process the entire volume multiple times per hour. Filter replacement frequency varies by model, typically ranging from 6 months to 1 year based on usage. Consider models with quiet sleep modes and auto-on features triggered by indoor air quality sensors for convenience. 


### Energy Consumption and Maintenance

Eco-friendly models with AHAM (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers) certification use less energy while maintaining effective filtration. Replaceable carbon filters help maintain optimal performance and remove odors, with costs ranging from $50 to $100 per replacement depending on the brand. Some advanced models offer UV-C germicidal lights to destroy biological contaminants. 


## FAQ


### What is the Oxypure air purifier?

The Oxypure air purifier is a high-efficiency device designed to remove airborne contaminants from indoor environments. It employs advanced filtration technology to capture particles, chemicals, and odors, improving overall air quality. 

The system combines a pre-filter, activated carbon filter, and HEPA filter to create a three-stage purification process. These components work together to trap microscopic particles as small as 0.1 microns while eliminating unpleasant odors and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). 


### How effective is the Oxypure air purifier?

The Oxypure air purifier demonstrates 99.97% efficiency in capturing particles as small as 0.1 microns according to its manufacturers. This performance level is comparable to some of the best air purifiers in the market, making it effective for removing common indoor pollutants. 

Independent testing has shown that Oxypure units can significantly reduce airborne particles, including dust, pollen, pet dander, and smoke, creating a healthier indoor environment. 


### What types of pollutants does it remove?

The Oxypure purifier effectively removes a wide range of indoor pollutants, including but not limited to dust, pollen, pet dander, mold spores, bacteria, viruses, smoke, and odors. The activated carbon filter specifically targets volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other chemical pollutants. 

The filtration system is particularly effective for households with pets or individuals sensitive to allergens, as it captures particles that trigger allergic reactions and asthma symptoms. 


### How much noise does it produce?

The Oxypure air purifier operates on three speed settings: sleep, normal, and turbo. In sleep mode, the unit produces less than 18 decibels, making it nearly silent and ideal for use during sleep or in libraries and offices. 

In normal mode, the unit operates at 28 decibels, and in turbo mode, it produces 41 decibels. Most users find these noise levels acceptable, especially considering the significant air purification benefits. 


### What maintenance requirements are there?

The basic maintenance of the Oxypure air purifier involves periodic filter replacement and filter check. The pre-filter should be washed monthly using the provided washable filter, and the activated carbon filter should be replaced every six months under normal usage. 

The HEPA filter requires replacement every 12-18 months, depending on usage frequency and local air quality conditions. The unit also includes an air quality indicator that alerts when it's time to check or replace filters. 


### Does it require much space or power?

The Oxypure air purifier has a compact design that makes it suitable for most room sizes. It measures approximately 11 inches tall, 12 inches wide, and 12 inches deep, taking up minimal space in any room. 

Power consumption is low, with the unit using about 65 watts in normal mode and 20 watts in sleep mode. This makes it energy-efficient for continuous use without significant impact on electricity bills.
