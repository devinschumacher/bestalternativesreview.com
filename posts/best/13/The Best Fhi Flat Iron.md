## FAQ


### What is an Fhi flat iron?

An Fhi flat iron is an electrical styling tool used for straightening and smoothing hair. It typically features a heated ceramic plate that glides easily through hair, reducing frizz and creating polished, salon-quality results. 

The Fhi brand offers a range of flat irons with varying features, including ceramic plates, tourmaline technology, and advanced temperature settings to accommodate different hair types and styling needs. 


### How do Fhi flat irons work?

Heat from the ceramic plates warms the hair shaft, making it more manageable and easier to style. The plates apply even pressure as you glide them through your hair, straightening it while minimizing damage. 

Some Fhi models include additional features like tourmaline coating, which helps release static and add moisture, and adjustable temperature settings to control heat intensity for various hair types. 


### What are the benefits of using an Fhi flat iron?

The straightening process reduces frizz and adds shine, resulting in smoother, more polished hair. The ceramic heating elements minimize damage compared to traditional metal irons, preserving hair health over time. 

Many Fhi models come with additional accessories like ceramic combs or heat guards, making them versatile tools for various hair types and styling needs. 


### How do I properly maintain an Fhi flat iron?

Always unplug the iron before cleaning or inspection. Use a dry, soft cloth to wipe away any residue, and avoid using abrasive materials that could damage the ceramic plates. Consider monthly deep cleaning with a dedicated appliance cleaner. 

When not in use, store the iron in its original case or a dedicated appliance storage unit to protect the styling plates and maintain their condition. 


### What settings should I use for different hair types?

 Fine or damaged hair - Use a lower temperature setting (around 300-350°F) to prevent heat damage and ensure even heat distribution. 

Medium hair - Medium temperature setting (350-400°F) works well for most hair types, providing optimal straightening without excessive heat. 

Thick or curly hair - Higher temperature setting (400-450°F) helps penetrate the hair shaft and reduce frizz, but use with caution to prevent heat damage. 


### Can I use Fhi flat iron on wet hair?

While some Fhi models are safe for wet hair, it's generally recommended to wait 24 hours after washing before using the iron. This allows your hair to air dry slightly, making styling easier and reducing the risk of damage. 

If your iron has a moisture sensor or is specifically designed for wet hair, follow the manufacturer's instructions. Otherwise, it's best to dry your hair partially before styling to ensure optimal results and hair health.
