## Buyer's Guide

A golf cart heater can transform your winter golfing experience by keeping you warm and comfortable during your rounds. These essential accessories come in various types and capacities, so understanding your options is crucial before making a purchase. 


### Heater Types

The most common golf cart heaters can be categorized into three types: electric, propane, and forced-air systems. Electric heaters are the most straightforward, featuring heating elements that run on your cart's battery power. Propane heaters provide more consistent heat through combustion but require regular refilling. Forced-air systems move heat around the cart more effectively than natural convection, though they're the most complex to install. 


### Capacity and Coverage

Select a heater based on your cart's size and how much space needs to be warmed. Measure your cart internally to determine the effective heating area. The heater's BTU (British Thermal Unit) rating indicates its heating capacity - generally, you'll need 10-20 BTUs per square foot of cart space. Factor in whether the heater provides adequate coverage for all seated passengers and any storage areas. 


### Installation and Hookup

Proper installation ensures safe and efficient operation. Electric heaters typically connect directly to your cart's battery, requiring only basic installation. Propane heaters need a dedicated fuel tank, lines, and a compatible regulator. Forced-air systems require additional components like blowers and ducting. Whatever you choose, ensure the heater is properly grounded and meets electrical codes. 


### Maintenance and Safety Features

Regular maintenance keeps your heater running efficiently and safely. Check propane systems for leaks and proper fuel flow, and clean or replace filters in forced-air systems. All heaters should have adequate ventilation to prevent carbon monoxide buildup. Consider models with automatic shut-off, overheat protection, and other safety features to prevent incidents. 


## FAQ


### What is a golf cart heater?

A golf cart heater is an essential winter accessory that provides warmth and comfort for golf cart drivers and passengers. These compact heating systems are specifically designed to work efficiently in the small enclosed spaces of golf carts. 

Modern golf cart heaters use either electric resistance heating elements or propane-fired units, with battery-friendly systems powered by 12-volt DC electricity. They are UL-listed for safety and conform to NFPA 150 requirements for electrical equipment in vehicles. 


### How do golf cart heaters work?

Most electric golf cart heaters work by converting electrical energy into heat through resistive heating elements. These elements heat up when current passes through them, creating warm air that circulates inside the golf cart to maintain a comfortable temperature. 

Propane heaters generate heat through a combustion process. They require a proper venting system to prevent carbon monoxide buildup and are typically used in golf carts with existing propane infrastructure for supplemental warmth. 


### What is the typical capacity of a golf cart heater?

Electric golf cart heaters typically provide heat output ranging from 3,500 to 5,000 BTUs, which is sufficient for heating small spaces like a golf cart cab. The exact capacity depends on the heating element wattage and air circulation design of the specific model. 

Propane heaters can offer higher BTU outputs, usually between 10,000 to 30,000 BTUs, making them suitable for larger carts or those with increased insulation needs. The heat output is directly related to the size of the propane tank and the combustion efficiency of the unit. 


### How long do golf cart heaters last?

With regular use and proper maintenance, most golf cart heaters last between 5 to 10 years. The lifespan depends on factors such as usage frequency, maintenance practices, and environmental conditions. 

Key maintenance items include checking heating elements for wear, inspecting electrical connections for corrosion, and servicing flame sensors and igniters on propane units. Operating the heater for short durations during cold periods helps prevent overheating and prolongs component life. 


### How much do golf cart heaters cost?

Electric golf cart heaters typically range in price from $250 to $600, depending on brand, wattage, and features like thermostats or timer controls. Installation costs vary based on whether the heater kit includes all necessary components or requires modifications to the cart's electrical system. 

Propane heaters, including installation costs, usually fall within the $300 to $1,500 range. Pre-installed propane systems may have higher upfront costs but can be more cost-effective in the long term due to the versatility of propane for multiple vehicle applications. 


### Are golf cart heaters difficult to install?

Installation difficulty varies between electric and propane heaters. Electric heaters are generally easier to install, requiring only electrical connections and possibly modification to the glove box or dashboard. Kits typically include all necessary components for a plug-and-play installation. 

Propane heaters require more extensive modifications, including running a propane line from the cart's storage tank to the heater location, installing proper venting, and configuring the electrical system to handle the increased power draw. Professional installation is recommended for propane systems to ensure compliance with safety standards.
