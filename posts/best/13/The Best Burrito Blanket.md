## Buyer's Guide

A burrito blanket combines comfort with convenience, keeping your burrito warm and your hands free for eating. Here's what to consider when choosing the right one for you. 


### Materials and Construction

Most burrito blankets are made from insulating materials like cotton, flannel, or fleece. Look for durable, machine-washable fabrics that can handle regular use and washing. The construction should be robust enough to prevent unraveling, with secure seam stitching.

### Size and Portability

Burrito blankets typically measure around 18x14 inches, which is ample size for most burritos and wraps. Consider a model with a convenient carry strap or loop for easy transport between your vehicle and restaurant. 


### Insulation Quality

While basic burrito blankets provide adequate warmth through their insulating material, consider investing in one with an additional layer of batting or insulation. This can maintain your food at a more consistent temperature during longer car rides or waiting times.

### Additional Features

Some burrito blankets feature handy pockets or pouches for napkins, utensils, or condiments. Others include decorative prints or patterns for a bit of visual appeal. Consider which extra features would be most practical or appealing to you. 


## FAQ

![Burrito-Blanket-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Burrito-Blanket-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a Burrito Blanket?

A Burrito Blanket is a portable sleeping solution that inflates into a comfortable sleeping bag, perfect for camping, hiking, or any outdoor adventure where you need a lightweight sleeping solution. 

It gets its name from its burrito-like shape when fully inflated, which allows you to tuck your legs and feet into the closed end while keeping your head and arms outside. 


### The Best Burrito Blanket Materials

High-quality Burrito Blankets are typically made from 20D nylon, which offers a balance between durability and weight. The material should be waterproof yet breathable to keep you dry during rainy nights. 

The liner material often consists of 400-denier polyester, providing an extra layer of protection against moisture while keeping the blanket light and packable. 

![Burrito-Blanket-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Burrito-Blanket-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How Do Burrito Blankets Compare to Other Sleeping Solutions?

Compared to traditional sleeping bags, Burrito Blankets offer exceptional compression and portability. Unlike hammocks, they provide better insulation and ease of use, though they're less suitable for hot sleepers. 

They're more versatile than quilts in colder temperatures due to their ability to trap body heat, but less convenient than air mattresses for those who prefer firm surfaces. 


### Which Temperature Rating is Right for Me?

Most Burrito Blankets have a temperature rating between 20°F and 40°F (-6°C to 4°C), suitable for spring and fall camping in mild to cool conditions. For colder temperatures, consider adding a liner or sleeping bag. 

Choose a warmer-rated blanket if you're camping in cooler climates or high altitudes, and a cooler-rated one for warmer weather or when camping near water sources. 

![Burrito-Blanket-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Burrito-Blanket-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What Size Options Are Available?

Burrito Blankets typically come in three standard sizes: twin (75" x 20"), queen (83" x 20"), and king (90" x 20"). The most popular size is queen, offering a good balance between comfort and portability. 

These blankets compress down to a small bag measuring 6" x 20", making them ideal for backpacking and overnight trips where space is limited. 


### How Do I Clean and Maintain a Burrito Blanket?

Machine wash your Burrito Blanket in a mesh bag on the gentle cycle with mild detergent. Avoid using bleach or fabric softeners, as they can damage the waterproof coating. 

Store it compressed in its stuff sack when not in use to maintain its shape and reduce wear on the material. If the blanket gets wet, empty excess water and stuff it completely before air drying.
