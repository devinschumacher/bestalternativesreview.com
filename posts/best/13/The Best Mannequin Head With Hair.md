### What types of mannequin heads with hair are available?

Mannequin heads with hair come in various styles, including full heads, wigs, and extensions. Full heads offer a complete solution, while wigs provide more versatility for different looks. Extensions allow for partial hairdos and styling options. 

Popular hair textures include natural, colored, and highlighted, with lengths ranging from shoulder-length to full cascading styles. The material typically consists of synthetic or human hair, with maintenance needs varying by type. 


### How does the size of the mannequin head with hair affect its use?

Mannequin heads with hair are available in different sizes to match your mannequin's body scale. Smaller heads (approximately 6-7 inches) are ideal for tabletop displays, while larger ones (12-18 inches) work well for floor-standing mannequins. Proper sizing ensures a balanced display and realistic appearance. 

Consider the specific display requirements when selecting a head size. Smaller heads may be more practical for shelf space, while larger ones can create impactful visual displays for storefronts or walkways.

### What maintenance requirements do mannequin heads with hair have?

Hair maintenance depends on the material and style. Synthetic hair typically requires weekly brushing with a boar bristle brush to prevent tangling and maintain shine. Human hair may need more frequent care, including daily brushing and regular detangling with a wide-tooth comb. 

Regular cleaning is essential to remove dust and debris. Synthetic hair can be vacuumed or gently wiped, while human hair requires more thorough cleaning with mild shampoo and warm water. Always ensure the hair is completely dry before returning it to the mannequin head. 


### Can mannequin heads with hair be customized?

Many mannequin heads with hair come in multiple colors and styles, allowing for customization to match your display needs. Some manufacturers offer dyeable options, while others provide a range of pre-colored styles. 

Customization possibilities vary by product. For synthetic hair, you may be able to change color schemes or styles. Human hair options typically include various natural and highlighted styles but may not offer as many color-changing capabilities.

### What factors should I consider when choosing a mannequin head with hair?

When selecting a mannequin head with hair, consider the display requirements, usage frequency, and maintenance capabilities. Factors include the intended display location, required hair style and length, and the level of detail needed for the display. 

Think about the durability needed for the display environment. Indoor displays may use less maintenance-intensive options, while outdoor or high-traffic areas require more robust materials. Balancing these factors ensures a display that meets both aesthetic and practical needs. 


### How do I properly store a mannequin head with hair?

Proper storage prevents damage and maintains the quality of the mannequin head with hair. Store in a dry, temperature-controlled environment to prevent moisture damage, especially for human hair options. Use a padded stand or display box to prevent compression damage. 

For synthetic hair, regular brushing and proper storage in a zip-top bag help maintain shape and prevent tangling. Human hair requires more careful storage, including weekly brushing and protection from extreme temperatures. Always ensure the hair is completely dry before storage to prevent mold growth.
