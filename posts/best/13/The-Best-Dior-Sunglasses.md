## Buyer's Guide

Dior sunglasses combine classic French design with luxurious materials, offering both style-conscious buyers and sun enthusiasts an array of options. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select a pair that matches your taste and needs. 


### Frame Materials

Dior offers frames in various materials, including metal, nylon, and acetate. Metal frames provide durability and a sleek appearance, while nylon blends flexibility with strength. Acetate frames combine lightweight comfort with a traditional luxury feel. Consider your active lifestyle and desired look when selecting a material. 


### Lens Options

Standard UV protection comes with all Dior sunglasses, but higher UVA and UVB ratings offer enhanced sun defense. Polarized lenses reduce glare from reflective surfaces like water and snow, making them ideal for outdoor activities. Gradient lenses deliver graduated tinting for intermediate light conditions, while mirrored lenses provide additional UV protection and can enhance visual contrast. 


### Size and Fit

Frame size ranges from 42-62mm to accommodate different face shapes. Understanding your face shape helps in choosing the right style: round faces suit angular frames, while square faces benefit from rounded shapes. Consider a frame width that's about 15% of your face width for a balanced look. Proper fit ensures glasses stay in place without sliding or causing discomfort. 


### Brand Authenticity

Authentic Dior sunglasses carry the official branding, including the double D logo and hologram sticker. Fake copies may lack these features or have telltale quality issues like uneven temples or poor lens alignment. Purchase from authorized retailers to ensure you receive genuine glasses with proper warranty coverage. 


## FAQ


### What materials are Dior sunglasses made from?

Dior sunglasses feature premium materials including acetate, titanium, and metal frames. Acetate frames combine durability with flexibility, while titanium offers exceptional lightweight performance. Metal frames provide a modern touch with enhanced strength. 

The lenses come in various materials like CR-39 resin for basic protection or more advanced options including XTRARITE polarized and gradient lenses for superior UV protection and visual clarity. 


### How do I clean my Dior sunglasses?

Clean your Dior sunglasses with a soft, microfiber cloth or lens-specific cleaning wipes. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials that can scratch the surface or damage the frame. 

If the lenses develop a foggy film, gently rub with a clean cloth slightly dampened with distilled water. For daily maintenance, keep your glasses in their protective case when not in use. 


### What's the difference between Dior Homme and Dior Women's sunglasses?

Dior Homme collections focus on bold, distinctive designs with metallic elements and structured frames. They often feature larger lenses and bolder color combinations to match men's fashion trends. 

Dior Women's collections offer both classic and modern styles with a wider range of materials and colors. Feminine touches like delicate metalwork and intricate patterns are common, with lens shapes and sizes tailored to women's fashion. 


### How should I store my Dior sunglasses?

Store your Dior sunglasses in the original case when not in use. The case protects against scratches, impacts, and changes in temperature. Keep the glasses in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. 

Avoid storing them in extreme conditions like direct sunlight, humid environments, or extreme temperatures, which can affect the materials and optical quality. 


### What's the typical warranty period for Dior sunglasses?

Dior offers a limited warranty covering manufacturing defects in materials and workmanship for a period of one year from the original date of purchase. The warranty is typically transferable to a new owner if the glasses are sold second-hand. 

Extended warranties are available through authorized retailers. It's important to maintain proper care of your glasses to maximize their longevity and ensure coverage under the warranty. 


### How do I find official Dior sunglasses?

You can find official Dior sunglasses through authorized retailers listed on the Dior website. These include Dior boutiques, select department stores, and authorized online retailers. Authentic products feature official Dior packaging and come with the brand's signature warranty card. 

Avoid purchasing from unauthorized sources, as counterfeit Dior sunglasses are common and may not provide the same quality or warranty.
