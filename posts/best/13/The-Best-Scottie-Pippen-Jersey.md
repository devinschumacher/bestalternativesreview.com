## Buyer's Guide

Scottie Pippen's legacy as a Chicago Bulls legend shines through every detail of his official NBA jersey. When selecting a Pippen jersey, several key factors ensure you're getting the authentic piece that honors his remarkable career. 


### Official Status and Authenticity

Look for jerseys bearing the NBA license mark and authentic game-worn details. The material composition and stitching quality should match authentic game jerseys, with moisture-wicking fabrics and reinforced stitching in high-wear areas. 


### Fit and Size Selection

Scottie Pippen wore a size 25 jersey, but sizing can vary between manufacturers. Start with his reported size and consider modern fits, as modern jerseys are more form-fitting. Take precise measurements and compare them to size charts for the specific jersey style you're considering. 


### Details and Accessories

Authentic jerseys feature precise detail matching Pippen's career uniforms, including correct sleeve lengths, shoulder pads, and numbers. Check for matching pants and socks, as these accessories often show the most wear and thus need to be authentic to maintain the uniform's integrity. 


### Condition and Long-term Care

Invest in jerseys made from lasting materials that resist fading and shrinkage. When purchasing used jerseys, verify the care history. Modern care instructions should include proper washing and drying methods to maintain the uniform's condition. 


## FAQ

Scottie Pippen's jersey is available in multiple sizes, typically ranging from small to 3XL. The sizing chart provided by the manufacturer should be followed for the most accurate fit, as some sizes may vary slightly between manufacturers. 

Measurements should be taken while wearing the type of underwear you plan to wear with the jersey. The chest measurement should be taken around the fullest part of the chest, and the waist measurement should be taken around the natural waistline. 


### What materials are used in Scottie Pippen's jersey?

The jersey is constructed from a polyester blend that provides both durability and moisture-wicking properties. The material is designed to keep the player cool during intense gameplay while maintaining a comfortable fit. 

Most jerseys feature a ribbed crew neck and sleeves with mesh panels under the arms for enhanced ventilation. The material is also stretchy to allow for a full range of motion during gameplay. 


### How should Scottie Pippen's jersey be washed?

The jersey should be washed separately in cold water using a mild detergent to prevent color fading and shrinkage. The use of bleach is not recommended, as it can damage the fabric and cause color loss. 

Airing the jersey to dry is preferable to using a dryer. If a dryer is necessary, use a low heat setting and remove the jersey promptly when it's dry to prevent shrinkage. 


### What should I consider when selecting a Scottie Pippen jersey size?

Scottie Pippen's jersey sizes run true to size, so standard sizing guidelines should be followed. If you prefer a more relaxed fit, sizing up may be appropriate. The chest measurement is particularly important, as it determines the overall fit of the jersey.

Look for signs of wear such as fraying edges, loose stitching, or color loss. These can indicate that the jersey needs to be retired and replaced. 


### What factors affect the price of Scottie Pippen's jersey?

The primary factor affecting the price is the material quality and manufacturing process. Higher-quality jerseys with premium materials and detailed designs typically cost more. The jersey's age and condition also impact pricing, with newer, mint-condition jerseys commanding higher prices.
