## Buyer's Guide

### Frame Design and Construction

Modern Honda mini bikes feature lightweight aluminum frames for better handling and reduced weight. Consider whether you need a step-through design for ease of mounting, or a traditional standover height. The frame should be sturdy enough to support the engine type without excessive flex under power.
