## Buyer's Guide

A squat cage is a critical piece of equipment for any weightlifting facility, providing a safe foundation for performing squats and other lower-body exercises. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the right squat cage for your needs. 


### Load Capacity

The primary factor determining a squat cage's suitability is its load capacity, measured in kilograms or pounds. This rating reflects the maximum weight it can support safely. For most gyms, a load capacity between 1,000 and 1,500 kg (2,200 to 3,300 lb) per upright is appropriate. The load resistance capacity should be two to three times the anticipated heaviest lift to account for additional equipment and safety gear. 

![Squat-Cage-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Squat-Cage-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Upright Design and Construction

Uprights are typically constructed of tubular steel with solid-core cross sections, offering superior strength and durability. The diameter usually ranges from 3 to 4 inches, with larger sizes providing better load distribution but less mobility. Uprights should be welded at points of stress concentration, such as the base plates and cross-bracing, to prevent failures under load. 


### Adjustability and Spacing

Most squat cages feature adjustable uprights that can be locked into place at various heights. The minimum spacing between uprights should accommodate barbell sizes ranging from 1 to 2.25 inches in diameter. Premium models offer finer height adjustment increments (e. g. , 1/4" vs. 1/2") for precise positioning and added safety. 

![Squat-Cage-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Squat-Cage-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Safety Features

Advanced squat cages incorporate several safety features. These include emergency quick-release mechanisms that allow rapid access to the lifting platform, padded upright collars to prevent barbell rolling, and safety bars that lock into position when the primary bar fails. Premium models may also include weight indicator systems to monitor load distribution and digital displays for tracking lift data. 


## FAQ

![Squat-Cage-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Squat-Cage-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a squat cage?

A squat cage is a freestanding metal frame designed to support proper squat form and protect users from common squatting mistakes. It features adjustable bars and safety pins that limit the depth of the squat, preventing overextension and potential injury. 

The cage enhances squat technique by clearly defining the bottom position and providing visual feedback. It's particularly useful for beginners learning proper squat mechanics or experienced lifters refining their form. 


### How do you use a squat cage?

Load the bar with appropriate weight, set the safety pins at the desired depth, and perform your squat. The bars restrict the range of motion, ensuring you reach the correct depth while maintaining proper squat form. 

Beginners should start with light weight and focus on technique before increasing load. The cage allows you to perform squats safely with proper support, making it ideal for all skill levels. 

![Squat-Cage-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Squat-Cage-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the benefits of using a squat cage?

Squat cages improve technique by preventing common errors like overextension and poor form. The adjustable depth feature allows users to practice at their appropriate range, helping to develop proper squat mechanics. 

Using a cage helps novice lifters start with heavier weights safely and experienced lifters correct their form. It reduces the risk of injury by providing consistent feedback on depth and technique. 


### Who should use a squat cage?

Anyone new to squats or gym beginners should use a squat cage to develop proper technique before attempting free squatting. Experienced lifters can also benefit by using the cage to correct form or hit deeper ranges of motion. 

The cage is particularly helpful for those recovering from injuries, as it allows controlled, safe squats with reduced risk of re-injury. It's suitable for all fitness levels when used properly. 

![Squat-Cage-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Squat-Cage-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What types of squat cages are available?

There are two primary types: vertical cages, which stand independently and restrict depth with adjustable bars, and horizontal cages, which sit on the squat rack and use the rack's safety system. 

Vertical cages are more portable and versatile, while horizontal cages offer more integrated rack functionality. Both types effectively support squats, though vertical cages provide greater independence and mobility. 


### How do you maintain a squat cage?

Clean the cage regularly with appropriate cleaning products to remove sweat, dirt, and debris. Check all bolts and connections for tightness monthly, and inspect the pins and bars for wear or damage before each use. 

Store the cage in a dry area when not in use to prevent rust and corrosion. If using a vertical cage, ensure the base is stable and secure to prevent tipping during use.
