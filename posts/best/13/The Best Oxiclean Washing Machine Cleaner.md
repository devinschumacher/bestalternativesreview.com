### What is Oxiclean Washing Machine Cleaner?

Oxiclean Washing Machine Cleaner is a specialized product designed to clean, deodorize, and protect washing machines. It removes detergent residue, improves wash performance, and prevents mold and mildew growth. 

The cleaner is typically a powder formula that dissolves in water and requires a single dose per load. It can be used weekly for maintenance or monthly for deep cleaning.

### How often should I use Oxiclean?

Using Oxiclean regularly can improve your laundry's effectiveness by removing residue that interferes with detergent performance. This leads to cleaner clothes with fewer re-washes needed.
