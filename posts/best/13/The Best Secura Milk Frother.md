### What is a Secura milk frother?

The Secura milk frother is an appliance designed to create creamy, aerated milk for coffee and tea drinks. It works by rapidly agitating milk to incorporate air, making it ideal for coffee shops and home baristas. 

These frothers typically feature durable construction and easy-to-clean components, making them suitable for both professional and residential use. 


### What types of milk can I froth with a Secura milk frother?

Most Secura milk frothers can handle dairy milk, including whole milk, skim milk, and almond milk for those who prefer non-dairy options. Always refer to the manufacturer's guidelines for specific recommendations.

### How long does a Secura milk frother last?

A well-maintained Secura milk frother typically lasts between 3 to 5 years with regular use. Factors affecting longevity include usage frequency, cleaning practices, and adherence to manufacturer guidelines. 

Deterioration can occur due to mineral buildup in the heating element or wear on the frothing tips, which may need occasional replacement. 


### What maintenance is required for a Secura milk frother?

Regular maintenance includes cleaning the frothing wand and housing after each use, descaling the heating element monthly, and storing the appliance in a clean, dry place when not in use.

### Can I use the Secura milk frother for hot drinks?

While some Secura models are suitable for heating liquids, always refer to your specific model's instruction manual. Hot drinks require more precise temperature control and may affect the frother's lifespan. 

For optimal results and longevity, use the frother for beverages that require both heating and frothing capabilities. 


### What's the difference between models in the Secura lineup?

Secura offers several models with varying features, including power settings, frothing capacity, and temperature control. Basic models focus on essential frothing capabilities, while premium models include advanced features like programmable temperature settings and larger frothing capacities.
