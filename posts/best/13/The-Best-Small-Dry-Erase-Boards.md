### Material and Durability

Most small dry erase boards use a magnetic backer material, typically aluminum or melamine. These surfaces resist warping and provide a smooth writing surface. Some boards feature a built-in magnetic strip for hanging, while others require mounting hardware. Higher-quality boards resist chalking and maintain their writing clarity over time. 


### Magnetic Pads and Accessories

If you need to display multiple notes or sticky items, look for boards with magnetic pads or built-in magnets. Some boards come with interchangeable pads for different wall surfaces. Consider the board's compatibility with magnetic clips, flags, or other organizational accessories.

### Cleaning and Maintenance

Choose a board that's easy to clean and maintain. High-quality boards resist ghost imaging (permanent writing marks) and maintain their clarity after frequent use. Consider the board's compatibility with both dry erase markers and erasers to keep the surface pristine.

### What mounting options are available for wall-mounted small boards?

Most small wall-mounted boards come with pre-drilled holes for standard wall anchors, though some models offer alternative mounting solutions like magnetic backing or clips. 

Ensure your board's mounting hardware matches your wall type – use masonry anchors for drywall, expandable anchors for plaster, and appropriate screws for wood studs. 


### How do small dry erase boards compare in quality to larger ones?

Small boards often feature the same quality construction as larger ones, with many offering premium finishes and durable surfaces. However, smaller boards may have slightly thicker frames for stability. 

Quality differences are more noticeable between brands than between size classes. Look for products with warranties and positive customer reviews to ensure lasting performance.
