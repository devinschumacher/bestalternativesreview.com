## FAQ


### What are Fit Tea products?

Fit Tea offers a collection of ready-to-drink tea beverages that combine natural flavors with subtle caffeine stimulation. Their products feature premium tea bases and premium ingredients, providing a refreshing alternative to traditional sodas and energy drinks. 

Each Fit Tea drink is designed to deliver a smooth, well-balanced taste while maintaining a clean label free from artificial preservatives, colors, and flavors. The beverages come in a variety of flavors, including classic black tea and innovative seasonal blends. 


### What sets Fit Tea apart from other energy drinks?

Unlike many energy drinks that rely heavily on synthetic ingredients and excessive sugar, Fit Tea focuses on natural flavors and premium tea bases. Their products contain real tea leaves and blend them with natural ingredients, resulting in a more subtle caffeine hit compared to highly caffeinated competitors. 

Fit Tea's commitment to using premium ingredients extends to their sourcing practices. They work with select tea growers and blend their beverages in small batches to ensure the highest quality and most authentic tea experience possible. 


### Are Fit Tea products healthy?

While Fit Tea offers a healthier alternative to traditional energy drinks, their products are not without controversy. Some critics point out that their drinks contain around 70 mg of caffeine per 12-ounce serving, which could be concerning for individuals sensitive to caffeine. 

The company addresses this by providing clear nutrition information and avoiding artificial ingredients. They also offer a range of caffeine-free options for those who prefer not to consume stimulants. 


### How many calories are in a Fit Tea drink?

Each Fit Tea drink contains approximately 50-60 calories per 12-ounce serving, depending on the flavor. This makes them a relatively low-calorie option compared to typical soda and energy drink choices on the market. 

For individuals watching their calorie intake, Fit Tea offers several zero-calorie options, including their sparkling water-based drinks that incorporate natural tea flavors without added sugars. 


### Are Fit Tea products suitable for all ages?

Fit Tea products contain caffeine, which means they are not recommended for young children or teenagers who have not reached a suitable age for caffeine consumption. The company suggests their products are most appropriate for adults and older teens. 

For individuals concerned about caffeine intake, Fit Tea offers a range of caffeine-free options that still deliver the flavor and natural ingredients their premium tea-based drinks are known for. 


### Can Fit Tea products be customized?

Fit Tea's ready-to-drink format means their products cannot be customized in the same way traditional tea can be adjusted to personal preferences. However, they offer a variety of flavor profiles and caffeine levels to suit different tastes and needs. 

The small batch production approach allows them to maintain consistent quality and flavor profiles across their products, though individual taste preferences may vary.
