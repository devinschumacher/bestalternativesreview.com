## FAQ

![Casestify-Phone-Cases-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Casestify-Phone-Cases-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What makes Casestify phone cases different from other phone cases?

Casestify cases are known for their premium craftsmanship and detailed printing. Unlike many other cases, which use basic screen printing, Casestify employs a UV-cured coating process that bonds the image permanently to the case's surface, preventing fading and peeling over time. 

The company also prioritizes ergonomics and functionality. While maintaining a slim profile, their cases offer robust protection through reinforced corners and edges, effectively cushioning drops and impacts. 


### Are Casestify cases compatible with wireless charging?

Yes, Casestify cases are designed to maintain wireless charging compatibility. The case's back panel is made from a conductive material that allows for efficient charging while providing protection. However, some users may experience slight delays in charging, which is normal and usually resolves after the first charge cycle. 

If you're using a case with metal inlays or additional embellishments, ensure they don't obstruct the wireless charging coil. The company recommends keeping the back panel clear of any non-conductive materials for optimal charging performance.

### What materials are used in Casestify cases?

Most Casestify cases are made from TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane) blended with PC (polycarbonate) for the backplate. This combination provides a flexible yet durable protective layer that absorbs impact while maintaining the phone's slim profile. 

Some premium cases incorporate additional materials like recycled glass inlays or leather accents. These elements are carefully integrated to maintain protection without adding unnecessary bulk. 


### How do I properly clean a Casestify case?

Casestify cases resist fingerprints and dust well due to their protective coating, but regular cleaning is still recommended. Use a soft microfiber cloth to wipe away dirt and debris. For tougher stains, a solution of mild soap and water can be used, but avoid harsh chemicals as they may damage the case's surface. 

If the case has intricate designs or raised elements, handle with care when cleaning to prevent scratching or damage to the printed graphics.

### How long do Casestify cases last?

With proper care, Casestify cases provide excellent protection and durability. The UV-cured coating ensures the case's design remains vibrant and intact for years. The TPU material effectively cushions impacts, protecting your phone's screen and corners from most drops and scratches. 

While every phone case's lifespan depends on usage patterns, Casestify cases typically maintain their protective qualities for 1-2 years of regular use, matching the company's standard warranty period. 


### What's the return policy for Casestify cases?

Casestify offers a generous return policy. If you're not completely satisfied with your case within the first 30 days, you can return it for a full refund or exchange. To initiate a return, contact their customer support team, who will provide you with the necessary return instructions and a pre-paid shipping label. 

After 30 days, the company still accepts returns under specific conditions. If you receive a defective case or the wrong model, you can return it within 180 days for a replacement or refund. For other returns, the company may offer store credit instead of a full refund.
