## Buyer's Guide

The Molekule Air Pro represents a significant advancement in air purification technology, combining multiple filtration systems to address a wide range of indoor pollutants. Understanding its key features and operational aspects is crucial for making an informed purchasing decision. 


### Filter Technology

The Air Pro employs the company's proprietary Pureness technology, which combines a pre-filter, True HEPA filter, and an activated carbon filter. This three-stage filtration system effectively removes particles as small as 0.1 microns, neutralizes volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and captures biological pollutants including molds and bacteria.

### Performance Metrics

The unit's performance is measured by CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate) ratings for particles and smoke. A high CADR indicates faster filtration and better air cleaning efficiency. The Air Pro also monitors indoor air quality through its PM2.5 sensor and displays the results on the accompanying app, providing real-time data on particle concentration. 


### Operating Costs and Maintenance

Energy consumption is relatively low at approximately 45 watts during operation, making it economical for regular use. Filter replacement is recommended every six months, with the cost varying based on local supply and pricing. The unit requires approximately 12 square feet of space for optimal airflow, and it operates quietly enough for use in bedrooms or home offices.

![Molekule-Air-Pro-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Molekule-Air-Pro-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What sets the Molekule Air Pro apart from other air purifiers?

The Molekule Air Pro features Molekule's proprietary Photoelectcionically Actuated Molecular Exchange (PAAME) technology, which effectively eliminates particles down to 0.1 nanometers – including viruses and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). This technology combines a photocatalytic oxidation reaction with molecular sieving to break down pollutants at the molecular level. 

Unlike traditional HEPA filters, PAAME technology continuously works to destroy airborne contaminants rather than just capturing them. This results in superior air purification, with the Air Pro able to remove 99.97% of particles as small as 0.1 microns. 


### How much space does the Molekule Air Pro cover?

Designed for medium-sized rooms, the Air Pro effectively purifies air in spaces up to 361 cubic feet – ideal for rooms measuring approximately 12 feet by 12 feet by 8 feet. 

The purifier's airflow technology ensures consistent coverage throughout the room, maintaining clean air even in corners and at room edges. For optimal performance, place the Air Pro in the center of the room, at least 3 feet away from walls and furniture. 

![Molekule-Air-Pro-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Molekule-Air-Pro-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Is the Molekule Air Pro easy to maintain?

The Air Pro's maintenance requirements are minimal, with only two filters needing replacement: the Pre-Filter, which captures large particles and needs replacing every 3-4 months, and the Core Filter, the primary filtration element that requires replacement every 6-12 months depending on usage and local air quality. 

The Pre-Filter is accessible from the bottom of the unit, while the Core Filter requires removing the top cover. Both filters feature visual indicator lights that signal when replacement is needed. The unit's design allows for filter changes without shutting down the purifier. 


### What are the energy consumption and operating costs?

The Molekule Air Pro consumes an average of 24 watts in continuous operation, which is comparable to a standard nightlight. This efficient performance helps minimize operating costs – with electricity costs typically ranging from $2 to $4 per month for continuous use. 

At the higher end of its power settings, the Air Pro consumes 30 watts. However, its advanced sleep mode reduces consumption to 22 watts, making it suitable for overnight operation without excessive energy use.

### How does the Molekule Air Pro perform in different environments?

The Air Pro maintains consistent performance across various environments. It effectively removes particles in both dry and humid conditions, with built-in sensors that automatically adjust settings to maintain optimal air quality regardless of humidity levels. 

The purifier's efficiency is not affected by temperature changes, performing well in both warm and cool indoor spaces. It's suitable for use in offices, homes, and cars, with the ability to handle slight variations in room size and air flow. 


### What are the installation and setup requirements?

Installation of the Molekule Air Pro is straightforward, requiring minimal space and no special tools. The purifier should be placed on a stable, level surface at least 3 feet away from walls and furniture to maximize airflow and performance. 

Setup involves connecting the included power cord, ensuring the unit is stable and level, and connecting the optional remote control for convenient operation. The Air Pro automatically detects when the filters need replacement and adjusts its settings based on room size and air quality conditions.
