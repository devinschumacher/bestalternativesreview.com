## Buyer's Guide

Bee glasses, also known as beekeeping safety glasses or bee face shields, protect wearers from stinging insects commonly found in honeybee colonies. These specialized protective eyewear items combine safety features with functional design to ensure both eye and facial protection during beekeeping activities. 


### Selecting the Right Style

Bee glasses are available in several styles, including full-face shields and vented face shields. Full-face shields provide complete coverage for the eyes and face, while vented face shields offer better ventilation but less overall protection. Consider your specific needs and working environment when selecting the right style. 


### Key Safety Features

Look for glasses that meet ANSI Z87.1 standards for impact resistance and have UV protection to shield against sunlight. The frames should be made of sturdy, unbreakable materials like polycarbonate to withstand bee stings and debris. Proper sealing around the edges prevents insects from entering, while clear or slightly yellowed lenses enhance visibility. 


### Comfort and Fit

Ensure the glasses fit snugly without causing discomfort during extended wear. The frame should sit comfortably on your face and stay in place during movement. Adjustability features like temple arms and nose pads can help achieve a customized fit that prevents slipping or fogging. 


### Care and Maintenance

Regular cleaning and proper maintenance extend the life of your bee glasses and ensure optimal protection. Use mild soap and water to clean the lenses and frame, avoiding harsh chemicals that can damage the material. Store your glasses in a protective case when not in use to prevent scratches and maintain their integrity. 


## FAQ


### What are Bee Glasses?

Bee Glasses are protective eyewear designed to shield beekeepers and people working with bees from potential stings. They feature a mesh screen that allows airflow while keeping bees at bay. 

These glasses provide comprehensive eye protection, including side shields to prevent stingers from reaching the area around the eyes. The mesh material allows for clear vision while maintaining safety. 


### How Do Bee Glasses Compare to Regular Safety Glasses?

Unlike standard safety glasses, Bee Glasses incorporate a fine mesh screen that filters out bees while allowing sufficient airflow. Regular safety glasses offer impact protection but do not prevent bee stings. 

Bee Glasses combine impact resistance with bee protection through their specialized mesh design. Safety glasses prioritize impact protection and may not provide adequate defense against bee stings. 


### What Features Should You Look for When Choosing Bee Glasses?

Key features include a durable mesh screen with appropriate cell size to prevent bee entry, secure elastic straps for a snug fit, and a sweatband to keep the glasses in place during work. 

Consider wraparound style for maximum protection, impact-resistant lenses, and replaceable screens for extended use. The glasses should fit comfortably over prescription glasses or be compatible with inserts. 


### How Do You Clean Bee Glasses?

Regular cleaning with mild soap and water helps maintain hygiene and visibility. For stubborn residue, a small amount of baking soda can be added to the cleaning solution. 

Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners that could damage the mesh screen or lenses. Allow the glasses to completely air dry before use to prevent fogging. 


### How Long Do Bee Glasses Last?

Properly maintained Bee Glasses can last 2-3 years with regular cleaning and appropriate storage. The mesh screens typically need replacing every 6-12 months depending on usage frequency. 

Impact-resistant lenses usually last the full product life span, but any signs of cracking or damage should prompt immediate replacement to ensure safety. 


### Can You Wear Bee Glasses with Prescription Lenses?

Many Bee Glasses come with prescription insert options, allowing wearers to maintain their corrected vision during use. Ensure compatibility with your prescription for optimal fit and comfort. 

If prescription inserts are not available, consult with the manufacturer about potential modifications to accommodate your glasses prescription.
