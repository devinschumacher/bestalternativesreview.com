## FAQ

![Womens-Swim-Shorts-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Womens-Swim-Shorts-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What makes women's swim shorts different from men's?

Women's swim shorts are designed with a shorter inseam and different waistband styles to accommodate women's body shapes and swimming techniques. They often feature built-in briefs or liner options for added comfort during the swim. 

The fabric composition typically prioritizes stretch and moisture-wicking specific to women's requirements, with sizes and fits engineered for female anatomy. 


### What should I look for when buying women's swim shorts?

Key features include proper sizing, appropriate waistband construction (secure yet comfortable), and adequate padding for sun protection. The fabric should be quick-drying and water-resistant. 

Consider the specific swimming discipline - open water vs. pool - as design elements and specifications can vary significantly between these environments. 

![Womens-Swim-Shorts-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Womens-Swim-Shorts-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do I measure for women's swim shorts?

Measure around your natural waist, typically just above your navel. This measurement should determine your waist size. The inseam length can vary based on personal preference and the specific design of the shorts. 

For the best fit, ensure there's no more than one inch of give when you pull the shorts over your hips. 


### What's the difference between one-piece and two-piece swim shorts?

One-piece swim shorts combine briefs with the shorts in a single garment. They offer streamline swimwear but provide less sun protection. 

Two-piece shorts incorporate briefs or built-in briefs, offering greater freedom of movement and enhanced sun protection through the top shorts. 

![Womens-Swim-Shorts-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Womens-Swim-Shorts-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can I wear women's swim shorts in the pool?

Yes, women's swim shorts are suitable for both pool and open water swimming. However, their design elements may differ between these environments - pool-specific shorts might prioritize different construction or padding compared to open water styles. 

Check the specific design description for recommendations on intended use to ensure they meet your needs. 


### How do I care for women's swim shorts?

Hand wash with mild soap in cool water, avoiding harsh detergents that can damage the fabric. Reshape while wet and lay flat to dry, avoiding direct sunlight to prevent color fading. 

Avoid using fabric softeners or placing them in the dryer, as these can compromise the water-resistant properties of the material.
