### [16.5 Inch Toy Black Submarine with Sound Effects and Torpedo](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Toy+Submarine?utm\_term=16-5-inch-toy-black-submarine-with-sound-effects-and-torpedo)

![16.5 Inch Toy Black Submarine with Sound Effects and Torpedo | Image](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcTIf9KpC9q0cOzxjidRnxqbmfjnkVTRL7ikO4Zy5-2tsbkOSMZhsamdyetqMoDkXIcZvnDWOeQ\_MlD2ScKkn6y\_UfXwoEE-&usqp=CAY)

This sleek black submarine model comes with realistic sound effects and two torpedoes, though it doesn't move on its own. At just over 16 inches long, it's a decent size that's not too overwhelming. The 2 LR44 batteries included help power the 3 buttons and sound effects, though some users have noted the batteries tend to work their way out of the case.

The USS Lionfish submarine model from Revell brings you face-to-face with one of history's quiet killers, complete with its distinctive twin propellers and formidable array of weapons. Scale down to just 21 inches, this kit doesn't skimp on detail, though modelers might want to spend some extra time adding those missing railings and refining the bridge.

Control an underwater mini-submarine that goes left and right, forward and backward – but be prepared for some frustration since it only works about one-third of the time and has a super-short range of just 5-7 feet.

## Buyer's Guide

Toy submarines offer an exciting way for children to explore the ocean and develop their imagination. When selecting a toy submarine, consider key factors such as durability, battery life, and interactive features to ensure your child has a fun and safe play experience. 


### Materials and Construction

Most toy submarines are made from plastic, which is durable and relatively impact-resistant. Consider the material's quality - some toys feature premium materials that resist scratches and cracks better than cheaper alternatives. Look for toys that are smoothly finished to prevent small parts that could pose a choking hazard. 

![Toy-Submarine-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Toy-Submarine-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Battery Life and Power Consumption

Power consumption varies significantly between toy submarines. Some models use AAA batteries and have limited underwater time, while others may run on more powerful battery packs that enable longer durations. Consider how frequently your child will play with the toy and choose a battery life that matches your play schedule. 


### Waterproofing and Submersion Depth

Not all toy submarines are created equal when it comes to water resistance. Some can only handle brief immersions, while others can fully submerge. For open water play, look for toys rated for deeper submersion. Also, check if the toy maintains its signal strength while underwater - poor signal can ruin the fun. 

![Toy-Submarine-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Toy-Submarine-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Features and Functionality

Toy submarines range from basic model boats to complex vehicles with multiple functions. Features might include lights, sound effects, or remote controls. For younger children, simpler toys without small parts or complicated controls are better. Older children might enjoy more advanced features that allow them to engage in storytelling or competitive play. 


## FAQ

![Toy-Submarine-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Toy-Submarine-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What age range is appropriate for toy submarines?

Most toy submarines are suitable for children ages 3-8, featuring simple controls and brightly colored designs to appeal to younger kids. For older children and adults, more complex submarine toys with realistic features are available. 

The age recommendations vary by manufacturer, so checking the specific product guidelines is essential. Some advanced submarines may include small magnets or batteries, requiring adult supervision for children under 6. 


### What features should I look for in a toy submarine?

Key features include smooth underwater gliding, realistic sound effects, and bright LED lights. Look for secure connections between parts and durable materials that prevent leakage. 

Additional features like propellers, depth control, or interactive gameplay elements can enhance the toy's appeal, but basics like stable floating and easy operation are crucial for all users. 

![Toy-Submarine-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Toy-Submarine-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do I care for a toy submarine?

Most toy submarines require minimal care. After use, thoroughly rinse the submarine with fresh water and wipe it dry before storage. Check for any damage or loose parts before each use. 

To extend the toy's lifespan, avoid submerging it in harsh chemicals or leaving it in direct sunlight. Regular inspection and cleaning help maintain its condition and proper function. 


### Are toy submarines safe for pools?

While some toy submarines are pool-safe, check the specific product's instructions first. Those intended for pools typically float well and can handle chlorinated water. 

Avoid submerging the submarine in saltwater or mineral-heavy water, as this can damage the toy and affect its performance. Always supervise children when using toy submarines in water environments. 

![Toy-Submarine-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Toy-Submarine-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How long do toy submarines last?

With regular care, most toy submarines last 2-3 years, depending on usage frequency and environmental conditions. Signs of wear include battery issues, leaks, or deteriorating paint. 

To extend the toy's lifespan, store it in a dry place when not in use and avoid extreme temperature changes. Operating instructions often provide specific guidance on expected longevity. 


### What should I do if my toy submarine stops working?

Check basic troubleshooting steps first, such as ensuring the batteries are correctly inserted and fully charged. Clean the toy's contacts and try different batteries if available. 

If simple maintenance doesn't resolve the issue, examine the toy for visible damage. Some manufacturers offer warranties or replacement programs for defects, so check your receipt for details.
