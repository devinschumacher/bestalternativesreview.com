## Buyer's Guide

Oakley Mercenary sunglasses combine sleek styling with Oakley's renowned performance features. This guide helps you choose the right pair based on your needs and preferences. 


### Sports Performance Features

Look for lenses with interchangeable technology (Rx and Non-Rx versions). Oakley's Prizm lens technology offers enhanced color saturation and contrast specific to different sports. Frame options include lightweight O Matter and Corvex materials for durability. 


### Military-Inspired Design

Merchant models feature similar tactical elements to Oakley's military frames. Consider the frame's adjustable fit system, temple length options, and nose-patch design for optimal comfort during intense activities. 


### UV Protection and Impact Resistance

Select frames with wraparound coverage for maximum sun protection. All Oakley sunglasses meet ANSI Z87.1 impact resistance standards, but premium models offer additional protection through inner lens coatings. 


### Fit and Comfort Considerations

Try on multiple sizes to find the best fit. Premium models often offer more adjustability through temple tips and nose pads. Consider the width of the frame in relation to your face shape for a flattering look. 


## FAQ


### What is the Oakley Mercenary?

The Oakley Mercenary is a high-performance cycling helmet designed for both road and mountain bikers. It combines aggressive styling with premium Oakley technology for enhanced comfort and protection. 

Available in various sizes and colors, the Mercenary features Oakley's signature Jet-Lock Ventilation System and moisture-wicking interior padding for optimal climate control during intense rides. 


### What makes the Oakley Mercenary unique?

Unlike other mid-range helmets that compromise between style and functionality, the Mercenary blends distinctive aesthetic elements with advanced safety features. The double-molded construction and strategic ventilation ports demonstrate Oakley's commitment to both form and function. 

The Mercenary's modular design allows easy removal of the inner straps and adjustment of the temple pads, making it adaptable to different riding styles and head shapes. 


### How does it compare to other Oakley helmets?

Compared to entry-level Oakley helmets, the Mercenary offers improved ventilation and a more aggressive profile. However, it doesn't feature the same premium materials as the top-tier Oakley Vapor helmets. 

Its positioning in the Oakley lineup makes it an appealing choice for riders who want a high-quality helmet without the advanced features found in specialty models. 


### What sizes are available?

Standard sizes range from Small to Large, with Medium being the most popular fit. Oakley also offers a Junior/Medium option for younger riders and larger heads. 

If you typically wear a helmet size medium, you might want to try the Large, as the Mercenary tends to fit more generously than some competitors. 


### How heavy is it?

At approximately 350 grams for the medium size, the Mercenary balances minimal weight with sufficient structural integrity. This makes it suitable for both casual commuting and competitive events. 

The lightweight construction doesn't compromise on durability, as the double-molded polycarbonate shell provides excellent protection against impacts. 


### What maintenance requirements are there?

Regular maintenance involves cleaning the exterior with mild soap and water, avoiding harsh chemicals that could damage the coating. Oakley recommends cleaning the interior with a moisture-wicking wipe to maintain freshness. 

Always store the helmet in a dry place away from direct sunlight to prevent damage to the shell and interior materials. The visor should be replaced if it shows signs of wear or damage.
