## Buyer's Guide

The Bissell Spinwave is a versatile floor care system that combines steam cleaning, scrubbing, and drying in one machine. Understanding its key features and capabilities will help you determine if it's the right choice for your cleaning needs. 


### Steam Cleaning Technology

Steam cleaning uses boiling water vapor to remove dirt, grime, and bacteria from surfaces. The Bissell Spinwave operates at 160 degrees Fahrenheit, which is sufficient for most cleaning tasks. The steam penetration and agitation provided by the rotating brush head can effectively sanitize floors without harsh chemicals. 


### Vacuum Suction and Filtration

The machine features a powerful 12-amp motor that drives the cleaning process. The vacuum suction helps remove dirt and water from the cleaning surface. For optimal performance, look for models with efficient filtration systems that prevent water and debris from backing up into the motor. 


### Brush Head Design

The brush head combines scrubbing action with steam application. Some models offer interchangeable heads for different cleaning tasks. Consider whether you need specialized attachments for tough dirt buildup, stairs, or upholstery. The brush head's dwell time and pressure settings can affect cleaning effectiveness. 


### Portability and Storage

The machine's weight and handle design impact its ease of use. Models with ergonomic grips and lightweight construction are more comfortable during cleaning sessions. Efficient storage solutions, like foldable handles or compact designs, allow you to store the machine without taking up too much space. 


## FAQ


### What is the difference between the Bissell Spinwave and traditional steam cleaners?

The Bissell Spinwave operates on a different principle than traditional steam cleaners. While conventional steam cleaners heat water to produce cleaning steam, the Spinwave uses a powerful motor to rotate a cleaning cloth and deliver water simultaneously. This dual-action approach increases cleaning efficiency and allows for both wet and dry cleaning modes. 

This design difference affects operating costs and maintenance needs. The Spinwave requires regular cleaning and replacement of its microfiber cloth, while traditional steam cleaners maintain their performance with regular water changes. 


### How long does the Bissell Spinwave water tank last during a cleaning cycle?

The water tank capacity is 1.5 liters, and it provides sufficient water for comprehensive cleaning cycles. On average, a full tank lasts between 10-15 minutes of continuous cleaning, depending on the size and type of surface being cleaned. 

For best results, it's recommended to refill the tank before the cleaning cycle ends to maintain consistent water flow and cleaning performance. 


### Is the Bissell Spinwave suitable for hardwood floors?

The Spinwave includes a protective floor guard that prevents direct water contact with hardwood floors, making it suitable for this surface type. However, it's important to use the appropriate cleaning mode and move the unit slowly to avoid water damage. 

Always test the cleaning settings on a small, inconspicuous area first to ensure the correct balance of water and cleaning action for hardwood surfaces. 


### Can the Bissell Spinwave handle pet hair and debris effectively?

The microfiber cloth collects pet hair and debris efficiently during cleaning cycles. For pet owners, it's beneficial to use the appropriate cleaning mode and make multiple passes over heavily contaminated areas. 

Regularly emptying the attached debris container and cleaning the cloth between uses ensures optimal performance and hygiene results. 


### What maintenance is required for the Bissell Spinwave?

The unit requires regular cleaning of the dust collection container and microfiber cloth after each use. The cloth should be washed and allowed to dry completely before reuse. 

Check the unit for proper water flow and replace parts as needed, such as the floor guard and cleaning pad. 


### Is the Bissell Spinwave suitable for commercial use?

The Spinwave is designed primarily for home use and may not meet commercial cleaning standards for high-traffic areas. For commercial applications, consider models with larger water tanks and professional-grade cleaning capabilities. 

Homeowners with commercial-grade cleaning needs should evaluate models specifically designed for professional use, which may offer greater durability and capacity.
