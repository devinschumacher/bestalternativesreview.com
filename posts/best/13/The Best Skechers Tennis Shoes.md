### How do you size Skechers tennis shoes?

Skechers tennis shoes typically run true to size. Most models have a snug fit that provides excellent control and responsiveness, especially in the heel and arch areas. It's recommended to try them on during the evening, as feet tend to swell slightly throughout the day. 

If you have wide feet, consider ordering a half-size up to ensure a comfortable fit without compromise on performance features. For standard-width feet, your usual size should work perfectly fine. 


### What materials are used in Skechers tennis shoes?

Skechers combines moisture-wicking fabrics with breathable mesh panels in their tennis footwear. The upper parts often feature synthetic materials that resist wear from court conditions, while the midsoles contain foam or gel cushioning layers for impact protection.

Independent testing has shown that Skechers' premium models retain their cushioning integrity and structural integrity better than many competitors, making them durable choices for regular players. 


### What comfort features do Skechers tennis shoes offer?

### What maintenance requirements do Skechers tennis shoes have?

Regular cleaning with mild soap and water keeps Skechers tennis shoes in optimal condition. The shoes dry quickly due to their mesh panels, which helps prevent mold and mildew buildup. For maximum longevity, avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners.
