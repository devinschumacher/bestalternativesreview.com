### [Olive & June Instant Mani Squoval Nails](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Purple+Ombre+Nails?utm\_term=olive-june-instant-mani-squoval-nails)

![Olive & June Instant Mani Squoval Nails | Image](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcQMdgwfM1Gkh0C\_tjf8I9LbYMSyn4Eko-QIps3JCWZ2MXBpVBABrRJpOsgWiper\_fu5gyawfwqAPgseh5g89ieU6E6RXXHs4Q&usqp=CAY)

These playful butterfly nails may look almost real, but their main flaw is how quickly they break - one reviewer's perfectly glued set cracked within hours. The square-but-pointy design is either love it or hate it: some say the shape makes them difficult to apply, while others praise the wide selection of sizes (21 total! ). The short nails look great for everyday wear, though the pastel pink background isn't everyone's cup of tea. 


## Buyer's Guide

Purple ombre nails blend shades of purple into a gradient effect, creating a striking visual impact. Understanding the nuances of this color trend helps in achieving the desired look. 


### Color Selection

Choose base shades that complement each other, considering undertones in your skin and existing nail color. Common combinations include lavender to purple, or deep purple to burgundy. 


### Application Techniques

Begin with a quality base coat and primer to ensure adhesion. Apply the darkest shade first, using thin layers to build the gradient. Tools like nail stroke brushes or blending sponges help achieve smooth transitions between colors. 


### Finishing Touches

Top with a clear sealant to protect the design and enhance durability. Consider adding glitter or metallic accents for extra sparkle, applied after the purple ombre base is completely dry. 


### Maintenance Tips

Regularly reapply top coat to maintain shine and protect the design. Remove purple nail polish with a reputable remover to prevent color transfer to other nails or skin.
