## Buyer's Guide

A Cup of Caterpillars is a specialized pet container designed to house multiple caterpillars at various stages of development. These containers provide an ideal environment for observing metamorphosis or breeding butterfly and moth species. 


### Material Quality and Durability

The container should be made from durable, non-toxic materials that can withstand regular cleaning and handling. Common materials include plastic and glass. Plastic containers offer better temperature control but may not be as durable.

### Ventilation and Environmental Control

Proper ventilation is essential to prevent mold and maintain optimal humidity levels. Containers should have dedicated ventilation holes with screen covers to prevent escapes while allowing air circulation. Consider containers with adjustable humidity control features. 


### Space and Capacity

Each caterpillar needs adequate space to move and feed. A general rule is to allow 1 square inch of container space per 1/2 inch of caterpillar length. The total capacity should accommodate expected population growth during metamorphosis.

### How long do the caterpillars live?

The lifespan of the caterpillars depends on their species and care conditions. In optimal conditions, they typically live for 2-4 weeks. 

During this time, they will molt several times before pupating into chrysalises. The development speed can vary based on temperature and nutrition. 


### What do the caterpillars eat?

The caterpillars are fed specialized butterfly milkweed or mulberry leaf diets, depending on their species. These diets provide all the necessary nutrients for their growth. 

The included food source comes in small packets that fit into the cups, ensuring the caterpillars have access to fresh food at all times.

### Are these caterpillars safe to handle?

The caterpillars are generally safe to handle, but it's recommended to wash your hands before and after touching them. This helps prevent the spread of bacteria or viruses. 

Handle the caterpillars gently to avoid damaging their delicate skin. Always return them to their container after observation. 


### What should I do after the caterpillars pupate?

Once the caterpillars form chrysalises, they will enter the pupal stage. The chrysalises should be left undisturbed until the adult butterfly emerges after 3-4 weeks. 

After emergence, the adult butterflies can be released into a suitable outdoor habitat or kept in a butterfly cage for observation until they are ready to fly.
