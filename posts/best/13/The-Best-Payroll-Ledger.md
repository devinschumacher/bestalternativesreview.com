### What Information Should be Included in a Payroll Ledger?

A payroll ledger should contain detailed records for each employee, including their personal information (name, address, tax ID), employment details (position, pay rate, hours worked), and transaction history (earnings, deductions, net pay). The ledger should also track tax withholdings, benefits contributions, and any other payroll-related financial transactions.

Regular backups should be performed to protect against data loss, and the ledger should be reviewed periodically for accuracy and completeness. Employers should consult with legal and financial advisors to ensure compliance with local regulations and best practices.
