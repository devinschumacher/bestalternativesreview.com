### What makes the Minelab Gold Monster 1000 unique?

The Minelab Gold Monster 1000 stands out in the market for its exceptional depth capabilities, detecting gold down to 180 centimeters in salt water. It uses patented technology to eliminate interference from mineralized ground, allowing for more accurate gold detection. 

With its 30% larger search coil and advanced multi-frequency technology, it outperforms many competitors in both gold concentration pits and mineralized ground conditions. 


### What's the range of frequencies available for the Gold Monster 1000?

The unit offers five frequency options: 165, 250, 350, 450, and 525 kHz. Each frequency performs best in different ground conditions and target types, providing users with versatile detection capabilities. 

For gold detection in mineralized ground, we recommend using the 450 kHz setting, which offers a good balance of depth and discrimination. 

![Minelab-Gold-Monster-1000-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Minelab-Gold-Monster-1000-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How much power does the Gold Monster 1000 consume?

The unit runs on four AA batteries and consumes approximately 750 mAh per hour during operation. This relatively low power consumption allows for extended use without frequent battery changes. 

When using the onboard LED display, power consumption increases slightly, but the display remains visible even in direct sunlight due to its contrast-enhancement features. 


### What type of ground balancing is available?

The Gold Monster 1000 features Minelab's 18-stage GroundBalancing system, which automatically compensates for ground mineralization across the entire frequency range. This ensures consistent detection performance regardless of ground type. 

Users can also manually adjust individual frequency bands within the GroundBalancing system to optimize performance for specific ground conditions.

### How deep can it detect gold?

Under optimal conditions in salt water, the Gold Monster 1000 can detect gold targets down to 180 centimeters. In fresh water, this depth decreases to approximately 100 centimeters due to lower electrical conductivity. 

The unit's depth capabilities vary based on target type, ground conditions, and environmental factors like temperature and salinity. Regularly testing the unit's performance ensures consistent results. 


### What's included in the standard accessories kit?

The standard accessories kit includes a 7" x 7" search coil, carry handle, battery charger, and a selection of frequency conversion discs. The kit also features Minelab's patented X-TEND search coil extension system for deeper penetration.
