## Buyer's Guide

Craft Smart Yarn offers a range of quality yarn options for any crafter's project. Understanding key characteristics will help you select the right yarn for your needs. 


### Yarn Weight

Yarn weights determine the thickness and drape of your finished project. Common weights include ultrafine (0), fine (1), light (2), medium (4), bulky (6), and super bulky (7). Heavier weights typically require larger needles and faster knitting speeds. 


### Fiber Content

Common fiber types include cotton, wool, acrylic, and blends. Consider factors like durability, temperature resistance, and moisture absorption. Wool excels for warmth but requires special care, while cotton is breathable but may pill easily. 


### Yarn Structure

Yarn can be bulky, smooth, or textured. Bulkier yarns like bouclé or cable yarn create dimensional projects but may be more challenging to work with. Consider your project's design elements and your personal knitting style when choosing yarn structure. 


### Sizing and Quantity

Check the recommended yardage and gauge to ensure you purchase enough yarn. Most patterns list yarn requirements in ounces or grams, so convert as needed. Always buy extra yarn for at least 10% of your project's requirements to account for mistakes or variations in tension.

### How should I store Craft Smart yarn to maintain its quality?

To maintain yarn quality, store it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture. Unopened skeins can be kept in their original packaging, while open skeins should be stored in a zip-top bag or yarn bowl to prevent tangling and preserve color.

Most Craft Smart yarns can be cared for using standard washing techniques. For wool and wool-blend items, hand washing in cool water with a gentle detergent is recommended, followed by laying flat to dry. Acrylic and cotton items can typically be machine washed and dried on a low setting.
