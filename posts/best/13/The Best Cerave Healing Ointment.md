### What is Cerave Healing Ointment?

Cerave Healing Ointment is a medical-grade product designed to soothe and repair dry, damaged skin. The ointment contains ceramides, niacinamide, and hyaluronic acid, which work together to restore the skin's natural barrier function and alleviate symptoms of conditions like eczema, psoriasis, and dermatitis. 

The product's thick, protective formula helps lock in moisture and create a physical barrier against irritants, while its gentle, fragrance-free composition makes it suitable for use on sensitive skin. 


### How does Cerave Healing Ointment work?

The ointment's primary active ingredients - ceramides, niacinamide, and hyaluronic acid - work synergistically to restore and maintain the skin's protective barrier. Ceramides help rebuild the skin's natural lipid structure, while niacinamide (vitamin B3) regulates skin cell differentiation and reduces inflammation. Hyaluronic acid retains moisture, helping to prevent water loss and maintain skin hydration. 

The formula's thick consistency creates a physical barrier against environmental irritants, while its fast-absorbing properties allow it to penetrate deep into the skin's layers for long-lasting effects.

Users typically experience improved skin hydration within the first week of use, with ongoing improvement in skin barrier function and reduced irritation over time. The rate of improvement varies based on individual skin type and condition severity.
