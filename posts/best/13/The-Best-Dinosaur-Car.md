### Made-from-Material Quality

The durability of a dinosaur car depends heavily on its material construction. Plastic models are lightweight and affordable but may scratch easily.

For longer-lasting toys, look for vehicles made from high-quality plastic or rubberized materials with reinforced joints and detailed finishes. 


### Size and Scale

Dinosaur car sizes vary widely, from small toys that fit in one hand to large models measuring several feet long. The appropriate size depends on the intended use and display space.

Additional features like working doors, realistic sound effects, or LED lights can enhance play value, but durability should remain the primary focus. 


### How big are dinosaur cars?

The size ranges from small toys suitable for preschoolers (4-6 inches) to larger vehicles measuring up to 12 inches for older kids and collectors. 

Choosing the right size depends on the child's age and space available for play. Smaller cars are ideal for travel or playrooms, while larger ones require more space for maneuvering and display.
