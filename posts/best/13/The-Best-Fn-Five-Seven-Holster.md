## Buyer's Guide

The FN Five Seven holster is a popular choice for those who need a secure and comfortable way to carry their pistol. When selecting a holster, several factors come into play, including retention type, material quality, retention setting, and belt compatibility. 


### Retention Type

FN Five Seven holsters offer different retention levels. Positive-lock models hold the pistol firmly in place with a simple press, while double-stack designs provide enhanced security with a side-release mechanism. Consider your carry preference: casual wear may require the simplicity of positive-lock, while concealed-carry situations might benefit from the extra security of double-stack designs.

### Material Quality

The holster should be constructed from durable materials that won't degrade over time. Look for premium leather options rated for holster use, synthetic materials that match durability, or injection-molded plastic for a budget-friendly solution. High-quality materials not only ensure longevity but also provide better shape retention and comfort during wear. 


### Retention Setting

Adjustable retention settings allow you to customize the holster's security based on your carry preference and pistol model. Most FN Five Seven holsters offer two or three retention levels, typically adjusted by screws or clips. Experiment with different settings to find the perfect balance between secure carry and quick draw capability.

### Belt Compatibility

Ensure the holster fits your belt width and style. Many FN Five Seven holsters are compatible with both standard and wide belts, but some models may have specific requirements. The holster's shape should sit flush against your body without sagging, and the belt clip should be positioned to prevent bulging under clothing.
