## FAQ

![Oster-Electric-Skillet-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Oster-Electric-Skillet-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What makes Oster electric skillets unique?

Our skillets feature advanced temperature controls and durable non-stick coatings, perfect for modern cooking. The electric heating element provides even heat distribution, while the compact size saves counter space. 

The distinctive design, with its raised edges and dual handles, makes these skillets incredibly versatile - great for everything from sautéing to simmering broths. 


### How do I ensure even cooking?

Always preheat the skillet before adding ingredients. For liquids, use the simmer setting; for solids, select the sauté function. The thermostat-controlled heating maintains consistent temperature throughout cooking. 

Place the skillet on a heat-resistant surface and avoid moving it while cooking. This prevents hotspots that can cause uneven heating and burnt food. 

![Oster-Electric-Skillet-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Oster-Electric-Skillet-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can I use metal utensils?

Yes, you can use metal utensils, including spatulas and stainless steel blades. However, avoid thick, heavy implements that might damage the non-stick surface. 

When handling the skillet, use the dual handles for stability. The raised edges help contain splatters, but always use a pot holder when removing it from the base. 


### What's the recommended maintenance routine?

Hand wash the skillet and base with mild soap and warm water. Never use abrasive cleaners or steel wool that can damage the non-stick coating. 

For stubborn residue, soak the skillet in warm, soapy water for 10-15 minutes before washing. Dry thoroughly to prevent water spots and ensure the non-stick surface remains smooth. 

![Oster-Electric-Skillet-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Oster-Electric-Skillet-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How long does it take to heat up?

The heating element reaches ready temperature in about 10-15 minutes, depending on the starting room temperature. Some settings, like high sauté, heat up faster than others. 

For quicker warming, place the skillet on the base without adding ingredients first. This helps preheat the cooking surface before food is added. 


### What should I consider when buying?

Capacity: Choose a size based on your needs - whether for single servings or cooking for a family. The depth affects how much liquid the skillet can hold. 

Features: Look for models with precise temperature control and easy-to-clean surfaces. Higher wattage usually means faster heating, but check the power requirements for your kitchen's electrical system.
