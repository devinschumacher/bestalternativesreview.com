I recently purchased this wooden art and activity table for our three-year-old, and I must say I'm quite impressed! The sturdy construction and bright white finish make it a perfect addition to our playroom. Assembling it was a breeze, with just a Phillips head screwdriver required. 

One of my favorite features is the four wooden bin drawers that slide under the tabletop, providing easy access to art supplies, toys, and games. The table is sized just right for our child, giving him plenty of room to play and create. The two-tone finish, with the white tabletop and drawers and natural wood sides and legs, complements our home decor and wipes clean easily. 

However, there were a couple of drawbacks. Firstly, I encountered a minor issue with the tabletop's alignment, which required some adjustments. Secondly, I noticed one of the drawers had a slightly loose screw, which I tightened to prevent any potential accidents. 

Overall, I'm happy with our purchase. The activity table is well-designed and functional, providing our child with hours of entertainment. I would highly recommend it to other parents looking for a durable and attractive piece of furniture for their kids.

### [Martha Stewart Kids' Art Table and Stool Set - Tidy Toddler Corner](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Toddlertable?utm\_term=martha-stewart-kids-art-table-and-stool-set-tidy-toddler-corner)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Toddlertable?utm_term=martha-stewart-kids-art-table-and-stool-set-tidy-toddler-corner"><img alt="martha-stewart-living-and-learning-kids-art-table-and-stool-set-white-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/martha-stewart-living-and-learning-kids-art-table-and-stool-set-white-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Martha Stewart Living and Learning Kids' Art Table and Stool Set, a piece of furniture designed for budding artists aged 4 and older. I must say, it was a sight to behold - sleek, sturdy, and stylish. The table, made with a perfect blend of birch and engineered wood, was smooth to the touch and easy to clean. I was particularly excited about the two stools that came along with it, as they allowed my little ones to collaborate and create together without any hassle. 

The art table, measuring 44.5"L x 30.5"W x 24"H, was spacious enough to accommodate several pieces of artwork simultaneously. The large, flat workspace provided ample room for creativity to blossom. The six fabric bins included in the set were quite useful, as they allowed us to store all the materials needed for various art projects. The portable paint cup holder was a thoughtful addition that made painting a lot more convenient. 

However, there were a few cons as well. The paint cups didn't come with stoppers, which made it a bit challenging to keep the paint from drying up when not in use. This was something I had to improvise by removing the lids and using them as marker and crayon storage instead. 

Additionally, one of the minor issues I faced was that the storage trays were too small for 8.5 x 11 paper. I had to purchase a separate two-tier paper tray to fit the size of the paper I needed for my projects. Overall, though, the art table served its purpose quite well and was a favorite among my children. The durable construction, storage solutions, and collaborative design definitely outweighed the minor drawbacks for me. 


## Buyer's Guide

When it comes to selecting the perfect toddler table for your little one, there are several factors to consider that will ensure hours of fun and learning. In this guide, we'll discuss everything from material choice and size to extra features and safety considerations to help you make the right choice for your child. 


### Material

The material used in the construction of the toddler table is a crucial factor to consider. You want a material that is durable, easy to clean, and safe for your child. Many toddler tables are made from hardwood, MDF (medium density fiberboard), or plastic. While hardwood can be an attractive option, it can also be pricier and may require more maintenance. MDF is both affordable and easy to clean but can sometimes be less durable. Plastic is a popular choice due to its affordability and ease of cleaning, but it may not be as sturdy as hardwood.

### Size

Another important factor to consider when purchasing a toddler table is the size. The table should be low enough for your child to easily reach and comfortably sit at. However, you don't want it to be too small, as this may limit the activities your child can engage in. Many toddler tables measure between 18 and 20 inches tall, with a top of around 24 inches in diameter. 


### Extra Features

While not essential, extra features like built-in storage or a detachable tray can be advantageous when selecting a toddler table. Storage compartments can help keep playtime organized, while a detachable tray allows for easy transport of snacks or toys during playtime. Additionally, some tables come with built-in activity centers or games to engage your child's imagination and help develop their cognitive skills.

### Safety

Finally, safety should always be a top priority when selecting a toddler table. Look for tables with rounded edges and corners, to prevent any accidents or injuries. Some tables also come with non-slip feet to ensure stability during playtime. Make sure the table is sturdy and built to last, so your child can use it for an extended period without any concerns.

It is essential to choose a table that provides maximum safety for your child while encouraging exploration and play. 

Toddlers come into contact with a variety of toys, food, and other substances, so choosing a table with an easy-to-clean surface and one that is made from materials that can withstand frequent, rough handling is also important. The durability of the table should be a key factor in the decision-making process. Toddlertables offer a wide range of colors, shapes, and styles, making it easier for parents and caretakers to find a design that complements their child's space and complements their home décor.
