The rustproof stainless steel finish added a touch of elegance to my space, and the transparent adhesive design was a neat touch that kept it hidden from view. The shower basket had three shelves, which made it perfect for storing shampoo conditioner, and the soap dish holder was an added bonus to keep soap and washcloth close at hand. 

However, I found it was not suitable for rough surfaces, like painted walls or wallpapers. Overall, I was pleased with the functionality and appearance of this shower caddy, and it has become a staple in my bathroom.
