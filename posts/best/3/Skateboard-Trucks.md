The interlocking bushing system and speed washers add to the trucks' overall strength and durability. Although they may not last as long as some other trucks, their performance and turnability make it almost worth the trade-off. 

However, I did notice that the bushings can be a bit finicky initially, causing the hanger to stick in a certain position. This is somewhat of a nuisance but not a deal-breaker, as I found that the bushings will eventually break in and settle in their rightful place. 

One downside is the customer support, which I found to be unresponsive. While I was impressed with the product itself, the lack of support took a toll on my overall experience.

### [Cal 7 Matte Black Kingpin Longboard Trucks](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Skateboard+Trucks?utm\_term=cal-7-matte-black-kingpin-longboard-trucks)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Skateboard+Trucks?utm_term=cal-7-matte-black-kingpin-longboard-trucks"><img alt="cal-7-180mm-reverse-kingpin-longboard-trucks-matte-black-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cal-7-180mm-reverse-kingpin-longboard-trucks-matte-black-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Ace Classic Matte Black Medium Skateboard Trucks for Wider Setups](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Skateboard+Trucks?utm\_term=ace-classic-matte-black-medium-skateboard-trucks-for-wider-setups)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Skateboard+Trucks?utm_term=ace-classic-matte-black-medium-skateboard-trucks-for-wider-setups"><img alt="ace-classic-matte-black-skateboard-trucks-66-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ace-classic-matte-black-skateboard-trucks-66-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on these Ace Classic Matte Black Skateboard Trucks and let me tell you, they're quite the powerhouse. The beefy 66's have a sizeable presence, and I found they work best on larger decks, around 9.1 inches wide and up. Ace has proven time and again that they know their stuff when it comes to skateboard trucks, so I had high hopes for these. But, while I was testing it, it became apparent that they had some room for improvement - mainly with the bushings. 

Despite the solid aluminium construction and the heat-treated steel axles, the standard bushings seemed to lack the necessary firmness to handle my weight of 85kg. In my experience, they would often pop out of the cups, which was quite worrying since it affected the overall performance. 

However, once I swapped the washers with something more robust, the wheels seemed to respond significantly better. Turns became more controlled and the rebounds were smoother, just as expected from skateboard trucks of this caliber. Yet, I do wish that the standard bushings were firmer to better accommodate heavier riders like me. 

Overall, I was impressed with the build quality of the Ace Classic Matte Black Skateboard Trucks. Although they require some adjustments on the bushings end, once corrected, they provide a smooth and predictable ride.

### [Krux K5 No Parking DLK Standard Skateboard Trucks](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Skateboard+Trucks?utm\_term=krux-k5-no-parking-dlk-standard-skateboard-trucks)

I recently got my hands on the Krux K5 No Parking DLK Standard Trucks, and I must say, I've never had a skateboarding experience quite like it. The polished silver hanger and baseplate looked sleek and stylish, catching my eye every time I passed by. The curb graphic added a certain edge to their design, giving them an appealing rebellious twist. 

One feature that immediately stood out to me was the elusive red Krux cushions. They added a touch of personality and made me feel like I was making a statement just by adding them to my board. I also appreciated the silver hardware, which complemented the overall look of the trucks and added a sense of robustness. 

Performance-wise, these trucks were fantastic. The Pur-fect Turn and quicker turning geometry made for smooth and effortless turns, while the new pivot shape and more durable injection-molded pivot cup provided improved durability and grind clearance. The inverted kingpin that locks into the baseplate guaranteed ultimate grind clearance, strength, and rigidity. 

However, I did notice that they were a little challenging to set up initially. If Krux could provide clearer instructions or videos on proper installation, it could make things a lot smoother for skateboarders like myself. 

Overall, I highly recommend the Krux K5 No Parking DLK Standard Trucks for their sleek design and impressive performance. They're sure to turn heads while providing the perfect blend of style and functionality on the skateboarding scene.

### [Atlas Truck Co. Ultralight Skateboard Trucks](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Skateboard+Trucks?utm\_term=atlas-truck-co-ultralight-skateboard-trucks)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Skateboard+Trucks?utm_term=atlas-truck-co-ultralight-skateboard-trucks"><img alt="atlas-truck-co-ultralight-48-degree-longboard-trucks-black-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/atlas-truck-co-ultralight-48-degree-longboard-trucks-black-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently gave the Atlas Truck Co. Ultralight 48 Degree Longboard Trucks a spin for an extended morning, and I must say, the whole experience was refreshingly different from the trucks I've used in the past. 

These aren't just any usual trucks, they're an innovative leap to the skateboard world. The forged A356 aluminum makes them stronger and more precise than any other truck in the category. The precision ball pivot, stepped axle, and threaded self-cleaning pivot cup offer a ride almost indistinguishable from trucks five times the price. I was genuinely blown away by the smoothness of the ride on different surfaces. 

The ultralight is not just a buzzword though. With the 8mm axle through the hanger, it really makes a difference as it's about 20% lighter than the original Atlas, giving you the added agility. The cone bushing board side matched with a cone bushing roadside means they also handle cruising, carving, and freeride quite well. 

In terms of build quality and durability, the black finish seemed to survive scrapes and scuffs without giving up too quickly. I had hoped for an all-black product, but I guess it's more practical to have parts color-coded. A bit of disassembly is needed initially for the installation of the trucks, but it's smooth sailing once they're on. 

However, I did notice a slight wobble on high-speed turns. Nothing that would discourage me from using it but definitely something worth mentioning. Also, I wish the included bushing was a bit softer. I had to switch it out for a harder one to feel more secure on downhill runs. 

Overall, these Atlas 180mm Ultralight trucks have made a new kingpin in my book. They're not perfect, but there's no perfect truck when you're dealing with the dynamics of gravity and concrete. These trucks definitely give you a taste of luxury for a budget price—and I'm a fan.

However, one minor drawback I noticed was that these trucks were sold individually. As a skateboard user, I know that two trucks are needed for proper functionality. This quirk might inconvenience some of the customers. 

In conclusion, the Slappy St1 Hollow Skateboard Trucks provided me with a comforting and smooth ride. Despite the single-truck arrangement, the trucks' unique features and high-quality materials made them a solid choice for any skateboarder looking to level up their experience.

I also appreciated the trucks' lightweight design.

## Buyer's Guide

Choosing the right skateboard trucks is essential to ensure you have a smooth, stable, and responsive ride. In this buyer's guide, we'll provide an overview of the most important factors to consider when selecting skateboard trucks, as well as some general advice on how to make the best purchase for your needs. 


### Material

Skateboard trucks are typically made from either aluminum or steel. Aluminum trucks tend to be lighter and more affordable, making them a popular choice among beginners. However, they might not be as durable as steel trucks. Steel trucks are heavier but offer better strength and stability, which can be beneficial for more advanced riders or those who plan to use their skateboard in demanding conditions. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Skateboard+Trucks"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Skateboard-Trucks-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Skateboard-Trucks-2" height="540"></a></div>


### Axis Type

Skateboard trucks can have either a standard axle or an axle with bushings. Standard axles use bushings to keep the axle in place. This type of truck provides a smoother ride but can be less responsive. Trucks with axles have a built-in hinge system that provides more responsiveness and better control. The hinge can either be a pivot or a flex style. Pivot systems offer more stability and control, while flex systems provide a more forgiving feel. 


### Hanger Type

There are two main hanger types for skateboard trucks: standard hanger and reverse kingpin (RKP). Standard hangers have the pivot cups facing outwards, which helps to keep the truck stable when carving or performing tricks. RKP hangers have the pivot cups facing inwards, which makes it easier to initiate turns and adds a bit of extra looseness to the ride. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Skateboard+Trucks"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Skateboard-Trucks-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Skateboard-Trucks-3" height="540"></a></div>


### Configuration

Skateboard trucks come in three different configurations: regular, classic, and pivot. Regular and classic trucks are similar in design, with the main difference being the placement of the truck's bushings. Regular trucks have bushings placed closer to the center of the hanger, while classic trucks have bushings placed further down. Pivot trucks have a single pivot point instead of bushings, which provides better stability and control. Choose the configuration based on your skating style and preferences. Beginners might find regular or classic trucks more comfortable, while more advanced riders might prefer pivot trucks for better control. 


## FAQ

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Skateboard+Trucks"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Skateboard-Trucks-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Skateboard-Trucks-4" height="540"></a></div>


### What are skateboard trucks and their importance?

Skateboard trucks, also known as hangers, are the metal components that attach the skateboard's deck to the wheels. They serve as a pivotal part in maintaining a smooth and controlled ride. Trucks come in numerous designs and materials, offering varying levels of responsiveness and durability. Selecting the appropriate skateboard trucks significantly impacts the overall performance and enjoyment of the skateboard. 

Popular skateboard truck brands include Thunder, Independent, and Venture, providing a broad range of designs, widths, and heights to cater to diverse skating styles and preferences. Finding the right skateboard trucks for your riding style and skill level can enhance your control and performance on the skateboard. 


### Low vs. High Skateboard Trucks: Which is better?

The height of skateboard trucks plays a crucial role in the turning and stability of a skateboard. Low trucks, characterized by a lower hanger height, offer enhanced stability and improved grip, making them suitable for commuting, cruising, and downhill rides. Their lower profile makes it easier to maintain balance and control, especially for beginners or riders who prioritize grip and stability. 

On the other hand, high trucks boast a higher hanger height, fostering a more responsive and carvy feel. Freestyle and trick skaters often prefer high trucks, as they provide better leverage for executing popping and grinding tricks. High trucks offer a higher clearance, benefiting skaters who perform high ollies or other vert-oriented tricks. The choice between low and high skateboard trucks ultimately depends on the rider's preferences, skill level, and intended style of skating. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Skateboard+Trucks"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Skateboard-Trucks-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Skateboard-Trucks-5" height="540"></a></div>


### What materials are skateboard trucks made of?

Skateboard trucks are typically constructed from aluminum or steel. Aluminum, known for its lightweight nature and corrosion resistance, remains a popular choice among skateboarders due to its versatility and weight reduction. Steel trucks, in contrast, offer superior durability and strength, particularly for heavy-duty use or aggressive trick riding. Some manufacturers opt for titanium or other high-performance materials to create ultralight and robust trucks, catering to experienced skateboarders or professional competitors. The selection of materials depends on personal preferences, budget, and desired performance. 


### How do I select the perfect skateboard trucks for my riding style?

When shopping for skateboard trucks, consider the style of skating you predominantly engage in, your skill level, and the primary purpose of the skateboard. If you're new or frequently cruise, low trucks might be a suitable option for improved stability and better grip. For trick riding and freestyle skating, high trucks might offer a more responsive and controlling feel, especially during high ollies and grinding maneuvers. 

Additionally, pay attention to the truck's width and axle length, as these factors impact the overall feel and performance of your skateboard. Wider trucks generally provide better support and control, while narrower trucks offer increased maneuverability. It is crucial to strike a balance that aligns with your riding style and preferences. Consulting with a local skateboard shop or experienced skateboarder can provide valuable guidance and personalized advice for selecting the right trucks for your needs. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Skateboard+Trucks"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Skateboard-Trucks-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Skateboard-Trucks-6" height="540"></a></div>


### Can I install skateboard trucks myself, or do I need professional help?

Installing skateboard trucks yourself is an option, but it is generally advised to have a professional handle the installation, particularly for beginners or those with little experience in skateboard setup. Proper installation ensures that your trucks are correctly aligned and balanced, providing optimal performance and minimizing the risk of skateboard damage. 

Most skateboard shops and local skateboarders offer installation services for a small fee. Seeking their assistance can provide peace of mind and save you time, effort, and potential frustration. Discuss installation options when purchasing your skateboard trucks, and don't hesitate to consult with a professional if needed. 


### What is the typical lifespan of skateboard trucks?

The lifespan of skateboard trucks varies based on numerous factors, including the quality of materials, frequency of use, and the rider's skating style. High-quality aluminum or steel trucks can last anywhere from a few months to multiple years, depending on the aforementioned conditions. Regular maintenance, such as retightening bolts and inspecting for wear and tear, can also extend the life of your skateboard trucks. 

Heavy-duty or aggressive trick riders may require more frequent truck replacements. Conversely, those who primarily use their skateboards for cruising or commuting might experience longer-lasting trucks. Ultimately, the lifespan of skateboard trucks depends on the individual skateboarder and their unique circumstances. It is essential to replace your trucks when they become loose, damaged, or no longer provide the desired performance.
