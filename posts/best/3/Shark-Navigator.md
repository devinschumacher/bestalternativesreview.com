### [Upgraded Shark Navigator Lift-Away Upright Vacuum: Improved Performance & Control](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Shark+Navigator?utm\_term=upgraded-shark-navigator-lift-away-upright-vacuum-improved-performance-control)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Shark+Navigator?utm_term=upgraded-shark-navigator-lift-away-upright-vacuum-improved-performance-control"><img alt="shark-navigator-lift-away-upright-vacuum-uv650-renewed-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/shark-navigator-lift-away-upright-vacuum-uv650-renewed-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Shark Navigator Lift-Away Upright Vacuum UV650, a 2-in-1 machine that's both lightweight and powerful. The ease of transforming it into a portable option for those hard-to-reach areas blew me away. Plus, its swivel steering gives you excellent control while maneuvering around furniture. With a completely sealed system and a HEPA filter, this vacuum excels at trapping allergens and dust. 

However, my experience with this vacuum wasn't all sunshine and rainbows. One downside I faced was the lack of compatibility with the Upholstery Tool accessory. I can only hope that Shark addresses this issue in the future. Additionally, I encountered a broken part on the refurbished model, which caused some inconvenience. Despite these setbacks, the vacuum's performance outweighed the minor issues I faced.

Utilizing the Shark Navigator Swivel Pro Pet Upright Vacuum daily has proven to be a significant transformation in my cleaning routine. [The vacuum's self-cleaning brushroll has been a godsend, particularly when dealing with pet hair, as it eliminates the need for manually removing hair from the brushroll.](https://gist.github.com/janeknowsbest77/d54e6de8f3a559580fede07daf47a5ea)

The aspect that truly impressed me was its remarkable capacity for intense cleaning. The device managed to pick up astonishing amounts of dirt and debris, specifically in narrow areas and corners. The swivel steering has also been invaluable, providing me with enhanced control while I maneuver the vacuum.

Despite these positive features, there are a couple of drawbacks. The vacuum's cord length can be a limitation, mainly when tackling larger areas. Additionally, the filter type is foam, which can be challenging to clean. However, these drawbacks are negligible when weighed against the overall satisfaction this vacuum has provided me.

All in all, the Shark Navigator Swivel Pro Pet Upright Vacuum has become an indispensable asset to my cleaning regimen. [If you're seeking a potent vacuum with exceptional pet hair handling capabilities, I highly recommend exploring this model.](https://gist.github.com/janeknowsbest77/6636c3d0034e36775d3c47d038253fea)

The versatility of the product was another major highlight, with the Lift-Away feature allowing me to detach the canister and clean hard-to-reach areas like stairs and under furniture. 

I loved how the vacuum's swivel steering made maneuvering around obstacles a breeze, while the anti-allergen technology kept the air in my home fresh. However, the vacuum's hefty weight and occasional toppling made me reconsider it for individuals with physical limitations. Additionally, the relatively short cord length and the absence of the floor attachment mentioned in some reviews were minor inconveniences. 

Overall, the Shark Lift-Away Professional delivered a high-quality cleaning experience that met my expectations.

It also comes with multiple attachments, making it more versatile for different cleaning needs. The vacuum is relatively lightweight and easy to handle, helping to alleviate the backache some users experience with heavy and cumbersome vacuums. 

However, some reviewers have mentioned minor drawbacks such as the lack of a light on the unit for visibility in dimly lit spaces. Additionally, some users have found the vacuum to be a little noisy, but this is a common issue with many vacuum cleaners. Another disadvantage cited by some reviewers is the limited availability of replacement parts for models other than the NV352.

The Shark Navigator is a versatile tool that can handle a variety of surfaces, such as bare floors and carpets. Its individual settings for different floor types make it perfect for those pesky dust bunnies hiding under furniture or in tight corners. What stood out to me was its deep recline angle feature, which allowed me to reach under furniture and other nooks and crannies with ease. 

One aspect I appreciate is its user-friendly swivel design, which enabled me to maneuver around obstacles with minimal effort. The vacuum also features a powerful motorized brush and a XL capacity dust cup, making cleaning a breeze. However, there were a few drawbacks I encountered. For instance, the battery life didn't last long enough to clean my entire home in one session. Additionally, the vacuum seemed to struggle with cleaning edges and corners, especially on stairs.

I've also come across a few refurbished units that had broken parts, which is quite concerning. 

Overall, the Shark Navigator is a powerful and efficient vacuum that makes cleaning much easier. But it does come with its share of issues, including compatibility with some attachments and broken parts in refurbished units.

## Buyer's Guide

When it comes to purchasing a vacuum cleaner, especially a Shark Navigator, it's essential to consider the various features, considerations, and general advice that can help you make an informed decision. In this buyer's guide section, we'll dive into the key aspects of Shark Navigator vacuums to help you choose the right one for your needs. 


### Suction Power

The suction power of a Shark Navigator vacuum is one of the most important factors to consider, as it determines how effectively the vacuum can pick up dust, debris, and dirt from your floors. Shark Navigator vacuums typically come with multiple suction settings, allowing you to adjust the power levels to suit different floor types and cleaning tasks.

### Cleaning Modes

Different cleaning modes can be useful for different types of floors and surfaces. For example, a carpet cleaning mode might use a more aggressive suction and spinning brush roll, while a hardwood cleaning mode would be gentler to avoid scratching or damaging delicate floors. Consider your home's floor types and the types of dirt you'll encounter when choosing a Shark Navigator vacuum with the right set of cleaning modes. 


### Filters and Dust Containment

An effective filter system is crucial for maintaining good air quality in your home and ensuring the vacuum is easy to operate. Look for Shark Navigator vacuums with HEPA filters, which trap the smallest particles and allergen particles. A well-designed dust container can also make a significant difference in terms of maintenance and ease of use. Choose a vacuum with a large-capacity dust container and easy-to-empty features.

### Weight and Maneuverability

A vacuum cleaner's weight and maneuverability are key factors that can impact your cleaning experience. A lighter vacuum is easier to move around the house, while a vacuum with a swivel neck or adjustable handle can make it easier to maneuver in tight spaces or under furniture. Consider your home's layout and your personal preferences when choosing a Shark Navigator vacuum that's comfortable and easy to use.

This allows users to easily and safely dispose of the dirt, dust, and debris collected during their cleaning tasks. The canister's shape also makes it easy to maneuver and empty while retaining its contents. 

Another advantage of the Shark Navigator is that it features a HEPA filtration system, which helps to keep the air in your home clean by retaining the majority of dust and allergens. The HEPA filter ensures that air circulation remains high while maintaining an allergen-free environment in your home. For additional convenience, some models may even feature a canister capacity of up to 0.75 quart, allowing for longer cleaning sessions without the need for frequent emptying. 


### What is the warranty on the Shark Navigator vacuum cleaner?

The Shark Navigator generally comes with a 5-year manufacturer warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship. This warranty is subject to the standard restrictions, such as normal wear and tear, damage caused by misuse, improper cleaning or maintenance, or using the vacuum cleaner for purposes other than its intended use. 

It is recommended that users refer to the specific warranty details outlined in their product manual or on the manufacturer's website. Additionally, timely registration of the vacuum cleaner with the manufacturer, as well as proper maintenance and care, can help ensure the warranty's validity and coverage in case of any issues.
