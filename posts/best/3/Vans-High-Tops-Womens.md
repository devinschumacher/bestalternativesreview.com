### [Vans Sk8-Hi MTE-1 High Top Shoes: Cold Weather Protection and Classic Style](https://serp.ly/amazon/Vans+High+Tops+Womens?utm\_term=vans-sk8-hi-mte-1-high-top-shoes-cold-weather-protection-and-classic-style)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Vans+High+Tops+Womens?utm_term=vans-sk8-hi-mte-1-high-top-shoes-cold-weather-protection-and-classic-style"><img alt="vans-sk8-hi-mte-1-shoes-black-white-m5w65-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vans-sk8-hi-mte-1-shoes-black-white-m5w65-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Vans Sk8-Hi MTE-1 Shoes are a winter-ready version of the classic Vans high-top shoes. As soon as I put them on, I could feel the warmth seeping in as the leather and synthetic upper materials gave my feet a cozy hug. The lace closure was easy to adjust, and I loved the look of the contrasting black and white colorway. 

One of the standout features of these shoes was the MTE-1 HydroGuard Wrap, which kept my feet dry even on wet winter days. The lining material was soft and breathable, while the insole provided just the right amount of cushioning for all-day comfort. 

What really sets the Vans Sk8-Hi MTE-1 Shoes apart is the traction sole that not only works well on snow-covered streets but also gives you the confidence to tackle icy sidewalks. The waffle-patterned outsole proved to be a reliable grip, keeping me stable and safe during icy adventures. 

However, there were a couple of things I didn't love about these shoes. The first was the slightly stiff feel of the tongue when lacing up. It took a bit of getting used to, but eventually, it became less of an issue. The second was the price, which seemed a bit higher compared to regular Vans. 

Overall, the Vans Sk8-Hi MTE-1 Shoes are a worthy investment for those who want both style and practicality in their winter footwear. The warm insulation, durable materials, and excellent traction make them the perfect choice for cold weather adventures, and the MTE-1 technology ensures you stay protected from the elements.

The rubber sole was another highlight, ensuring durability and wear resistance. 

However, I found that the shoes were a bit tight around the tongue and required some adjustment to achieve a comfortable fit. This wasn't an issue for short outings, but I wouldn't recommend these shoes for long walking or standing sessions.

### Important Features

When shopping for Vans High Tops Womens, consider the following features that impact comfort and durability. These include the material, fit, cushioning, and lacing system. Vans are known for their classic canvas design, but they also offer other materials like leather for added durability. The fit should provide adequate support without being too tight or too loose, considering that Vans typically come in a standard fit. Look for shoes with cushioning in the soles to provide shock absorption and comfort. Lastly, the lacing system should be easy to adjust and secure, ensuring that your shoes stay in place during wear.

### Fit and Sizing

Vans High Tops Womens typically come in standard sizes, but it is crucial to ensure a proper fit before making your purchase. Measure the length and width of your foot and compare it to the shoe's size chart. Generally, you should expect your Vans High Tops Womens to be true to size or slightly larger due to the padding in the shoe. Additionally, consider any orthotics or inserts you plan on using before purchasing. 


### Maintenance and Care

To prolong the life of your Vans High Tops Womens, it's essential to maintain and care for them properly. Clean them regularly with a soft-bristled brush or a damp cloth to remove dirt and debris. Avoid using harsh chemicals or cleaning agents, as they can damage the material. If you spill something on your shoes, clean it immediately to prevent any stains from setting. Store your shoes in a cool, dry place, and avoid exposing them to direct sunlight for extended periods, as UV rays can cause the color to fade.
