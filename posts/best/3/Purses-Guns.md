Imagine walking confidently on your daily commute, carrying a stylish and functional shoulder bag. That's the vibe I get from the Gun Toten Mamas Concealed Carry Large Hobo Handbag. Made in the United States, this imported handbag is not just fashionable, but also practical for those who prefer a hands-free approach for essentials, such as a gun. 

The one-size-fits-all hobo handbag is surprisingly spacious and has a concealed carry compartment for left or right-hand users. The 3-sided opening allows for easy and maximum access, while the special padding helps prevent imprinting of the gun. Adjusting the holster to your comfort is another plus, offering the best concealment angle for you. 

Aside from its primary function, this handbag also includes a mini holster designed by Mernickle Holsters, reflecting Gun Toten Mamas' commitment to quality. The bag is fully lined with Gun to'n Mamas logo lining, adding a personal touch of uniqueness. And with a weight of just 1.7 lbs, this handbag's versatility makes it perfect for all-day use. 


### [Concealed Carry Distressed Leather Purse by Gun Tote'n Mamas](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Purses+Guns?utm\_term=concealed-carry-distressed-leather-purse-by-gun-toten-mamas)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Purses+Guns?utm_term=concealed-carry-distressed-leather-purse-by-gun-toten-mamas"><img alt="gun-toten-mamas-distressed-leather-slim-x-body-rfid-concealed-carry-purse-in-blue-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gun-toten-mamas-distressed-leather-slim-x-body-rfid-concealed-carry-purse-in-blue-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Gun Tote'n Mamas Slim X-Body Concealed Carry Purse in Blue, and I must say, it was a game changer for this busy momma. As a gun carrier, I'm always on the lookout for stylish and functional holsters. This bag easily fit my S&W 9mm EZ and the removable holster was a true lifesaver. I went for the ambidextrous design, which allowed me to wear it on either side. The strap was a comfortable fit and kept the bag securely in place. 

One of the things that impressed me the most was the RFID-protected outside pocket. I could easily slide in my ID and credit cards, keeping them secure and safe from any potential hackers. Another little bonus was the built-in wallet organizer, including clear ID windows and 14 card slots. 

However, there were some minor downsides. The bag itself was rather heavy, especially when I added my handgun. I guess that's the trade-off for such a secure and functional piece. Plus, the main materials seemed to be imported rather than made in the USA, which was a bit disappointing. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend this purse to other gun carrier moms. It hits the right balance between style and practicality, and the RFID-protection really sealed the deal for me.

I especially liked the tactical shoulder bag's back zippered pocket, which provided additional space for my essentials. 

The dimensions of the purse (10-inches long x 6.5-inches wide x 2-inches high) made it the perfect size for carrying my concealed carry weapon with ease.

### [Stylish Bulldog Hobo Purse with Holster for Everyday Convenience](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Purses+Guns?utm\_term=stylish-bulldog-hobo-purse-with-holster-for-everyday-convenience)

One of my favorite features is the corner accents that give the purse a unique and attractive appearance. However, I must admit that I was a bit concerned about the size of the purse initially. Measuring 13 inches x 10.5 inches x 3.5 inches, it may seem a bit larger than anticipated. But once I started using it, I realized that the size was actually perfect for carrying everything I needed. 

The concealed compartment pocket is also a valuable feature, as it allows for discreet access to the holster. The zippers are quiet, making them perfect for situations where you don't want to draw attention to yourself. The holster's positioning inside the purse is adjustable thanks to the velcro, which is a nice touch. 

One aspect of the purse I wish were different is the size of the cell phone pocket. It's not quite large enough to securely hold a phone, and I had to place it in one of the main compartments instead. 

Despite this minor inconvenience, I must say that overall, I'm quite impressed with the Bulldog Hobo Style Purse. It is both stylish and functional, with ample storage space for all my essentials. I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable and secure way to carry their personal belongings and a firearm.

Now onto the functionality, the concealed carry compartment is ingeniously designed and allows for easy and quick access to your firearm with minimal fuss. This particular handbag has made it significantly easier for me to be secure anywhere I go on a daily basis. 

The ample interior space is another noteworthy feature, enabling me to keep all my essentials, from credit cards to my trusty water bottle, in one safe place. The keyring lock provided by Browning ensures that everything remains secure within the handbag. 

That being said, there were a couple of minor issues that I needed to address. On one occasion, the zipper became snagged, which I would not want to happen in the middle of a crowded street. Also, the shoulder strap was a bit too long for my liking, causing it to feel awkward when I wore it slung over one of my shoulders. 

Despite the minor issues, I have found the Alexandria Concealed Carry Handbag to be an excellent choice for anyone in search of a concealed carry solution that not only serves its purpose but does it with style. This bag has earned its place as a staple in my daily life.

### What are purses guns?

Purses guns refer to small concealed weapons that can be carried in a purse or handbag for self-defense purposes. These weapons are designed to be discreet, lightweight, and easy to conceal, making them ideal for individuals who need to protect themselves without drawing unwanted attention. Purses guns can come in various forms, such as stun guns, pepper spray, or even miniature replica firearms, but they all serve the same purpose of providing personal security. 

It is essential to note that purses guns should only be used responsibly and in situations where one's safety is at risk. Improper handling or misuse can result in injury or legal consequences. Always review local laws and regulations related to self-defense weapons before purchasing or carrying a purses gun. 


### Are purses guns legal to own?

The legality of purses guns varies depending on the location. Some states and countries allow the possession of self-defense weapons like stun guns and pepper spray, while others have strict laws regarding their ownership. It is crucial to research and familiarize yourself with the specific laws in your area before purchasing or carrying a purses gun. 

In some jurisdictions, it may be necessary to obtain a permit or license to possess a self-defense weapon. Always consult with local law enforcement or legal authorities if you are unsure about the legality of purses guns in your area. Failing to comply with the law can result in serious consequences, including fines, imprisonment, or both.

### What is the difference between a stun gun and pepper spray?

Stun guns and pepper spray are two common types of purses guns, each with their own advantages and limitations. Stun guns work by emitting an electric shock that can incapacitate an attacker, giving the user time to escape or defend themselves. They are generally more effective against larger, stronger attackers but may require a closer range to be effective. 

Pepper spray, on the other hand, is a chemical irritant that can cause temporary blindness, coughing, and difficulty breathing in those exposed to it. The effects of pepper spray are usually felt within seconds and can last for several minutes, allowing the user to escape or subdue an attacker. Pepper spray is highly effective against multiple attackers and has a longer range compared to stun guns. 


### How do stun guns work?

Stun guns work by emitting an electric shock that disrupts an attacker's nervous system, rendering them temporarily incapacitated. Stun guns emit a non-lethal amount of electricity, which is strong enough to cause pain and muscle contractions but not severe enough to cause permanent damage or death. The user has to aim the stun gun at the attacker and activate it to deliver the charge. 

There are different types of stun guns available, such as handheld stun guns, stun batons, or stun guns disguised as other items. It is essential to use stun guns responsibly and only in situations where one's safety is at risk. Incorrect usage or misapplication of a stun gun can result in injury or legal consequences.

### What should I look for when purchasing a purses gun?

When purchasing a purses gun, it is crucial to consider various factors to ensure the product is both effective and safe. Some essential aspects to consider include the weapon's range, power, and ease of use. A purses gun should also be comfortable to carry and disguised as a regular purse or handbag to avoid drawing unwanted attention. 

Additionally, it is vital to research the manufacturer's credentials and check for any relevant safety certifications. Always consult with local law enforcement or legal authorities if you are unsure about the legality or safety of a purses gun before purchasing or carrying it. Proper maintenance and safe storage of the weapon are also essential to ensure its continued effectiveness and safety. 


### Can purses guns be used for self-defense against animals as well?

Yes, purses guns can be used for self-defense against animals as long as they are appropriate for the situation. Pepper spray is particularly effective against animals, as it can cause temporary blindness, coughing, and difficulty breathing, giving the user enough time to escape or take appropriate actions. Some stun guns may also be effective against animals, but they generally require a closer range and may not be as suitable for animal self-defense. 

When using purses guns for self-defense against animals, it is essential to be cautious and consider the animal's behavior. Attempting to scare or intimidate the animal can often be more effective than confrontation. In situations where the animal poses an immediate threat, a purses gun can provide a means of protection, but always prioritize safety and avoid unnecessary risk.
