### [Pierre Dumas Kenzie 9 Brown Women's Bootie](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Pierre+Dumas+Boots?utm\_term=pierre-dumas-kenzie-9-brown-womens-bootie)

I recently stumbled upon the Pierre Dumas Kenzie 9 and was intrigued by the cute silhouette and faux-suede upper. As I slipped my foot into the bootie, I was pleasantly surprised by the light padding and flexible fit thanks to the stretch goring. The 1-inch stacked heel added a bit of height without being too overwhelming. 

However, there were a few downsides to this otherwise adorable shoe. The front bottom part of the bootie was quite slippery, especially on rugs, which led me to patch it with a slip-resistant thread. Another minor issue was that the color appeared to be slightly different in person than in the picture, with a lighter silver tone instead of the advertised dark grey.
