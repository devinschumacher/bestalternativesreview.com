<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Transformers+The+Last+Knight+Toys?utm_term=nemesis-prime-dlx-scale-figurine-transformers-the-last-knight"><img alt="nemesis-prime-dlx-scale-collectible-figure-transformers-the-last-kn-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/nemesis-prime-dlx-scale-collectible-figure-transformers-the-last-kn-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Transformers The Last Knight Hot Rod Toys](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Transformers+The+Last+Knight+Toys?utm\_term=transformers-the-last-knight-hot-rod-toys)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Transformers+The+Last+Knight+Toys?utm_term=transformers-the-last-knight-hot-rod-toys"><img alt="transformers-studio-series-deluxe-the-last-knight-hot-rod-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/transformers-studio-series-deluxe-the-last-knight-hot-rod-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Imagine being transported to the world of Transformers through a deluxe toy that feels almost real. That's the experience I got with the Studio Series Deluxe The Last Knight Hot Rod. Standing at about 4.5 inches tall, it transforms from a sports car to a robot effortlessly, making it a unique addition to my toy collection. 

The Hot Rod transformation is a piece of art in itself, with its sleek design and attention to detail. The designers have done an excellent job in making it look true to the movie character. But there were a couple of frustrations - the gun's peg often doesn't stay in its designated slot during vehicle mode, which made me have to hold it in place. In robot mode, it keeps falling off from the peg on the thigh. 

Despite a few niggles, Hot Rod is indeed a worthwhile addition to the Transformers series. Each figure in Studio Series comes with impressive accuracy to the movie's version, which makes them a great treat for fans. The packaging is classy, and the toy is well-built, standing up to play and even display. 

My only caution to other fans would be to handle the figure with care as it can be a bit fragile - like the right leg of mine that had a ball joint issue. However, the pros of the toy far outweigh the cons. With its great design and transformation dynamics, plus the attention to detail that Hasbro is known for, Hot Rod is a must-have toy for any Transformers enthusiast.

On the downside, the batteries are not included, which can be a hassle for some users.

As a huge fan of Transformers and Bumblebee's character, I couldn't resist trying out this new model kit from Doyusha. It's based on the beloved character as seen in the 2017 movie The Last Knight, and let me tell you, it certainly lived up to my expectations. 

What stood out the most for me were the highly detailed parts, which almost looked too good to assemble. And you know what? I didn't need any glue! Some of the parts were already painted, which made the assembling process even more exciting. 

The movable parts included in this kit allowed me to recreate my favorite battle scenes from the movie, adding a fun interactive element to the mix. Plus, I couldn't be happier with the close-combat hammer and the base that came with Bumblebee. 

However, I must admit that the figure was a bit taller than I had anticipated, standing at about 9.2 cm tall when completed. While this wasn't a deal-breaker for me, it might be something to consider before purchasing for those who are after a smaller model. 

All in all, this model kit is a fantastic addition to any collection, combining a beautiful, detailed design with a fun assembly process. And don't forget that sturdy construction and those incredibly poseable joints! Bumblebee has easily become the new leader of my Autobot squad, and I can't wait to see what other Transformers Doyusha has in store for us. Highly recommended for fans young and old!

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Transformers+The+Last+Knight+Toys?utm_term=infernocus-5-bot-combiner-from-transformers-the-last-knight"><img alt="transformers-the-last-knight-5-bot-combiner-infernocus-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/transformers-the-last-knight-5-bot-combiner-infernocus-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Autobot Hot Rod Flip & Change Figure (Transformers: The Last Knight)](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Transformers+The+Last+Knight+Toys?utm\_term=autobot-hot-rod-flip-change-figure-transformers-the-last-knight)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Transformers+The+Last+Knight+Toys?utm_term=autobot-hot-rod-flip-change-figure-transformers-the-last-knight"><img alt="transformers-the-last-knight-autobots-unite-11inch-flip-change-autobot-hot-rod-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/transformers-the-last-knight-autobots-unite-11inch-flip-change-autobot-hot-rod-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a Transformers fan, I had high hopes for the Autobots Unite 11-inch Flip & Change Autobot Hot Rod figure. But after unboxing, I found the figure to be a mix of good and bad. 

The first thing I noticed was how well the figure was designed, making it easy for even a child to transform it from robot mode to sports car in just two quick steps. The scale was enormous, taking the typical Transformers action to new heights. It was the same Hot Rod figure from "Transformers: The Last Knight" movie – the hero who is the first to battle and last to leave. 

In terms of quality, though, I found it somewhat disappointing. The plastic felt cheaper, less sturdy than I had expected. The flimsy transformation mechanism scared me. With a product like this, you expect it to stand up to rough play and last a bit longer. 

But the most disappointing aspect was finding out that many of the users have reported pieces breaking off after just a few uses. For instance, one reviewer mentioned a piece breaking off from the back after just a night of play, another complained about the product being a 'piece of junk'. 

In conclusion, while this Autobot Hot Rod figure looked promising, its build and quality let it down. It was an exciting concept that unfortunately didn't live up to the hype. It was great to see a version of Hot Rod much larger than other action figures on the market, but durability was compromised. 


### [Hot Rod Transformers: The Last Knight Deluxe Figure](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Transformers+The+Last+Knight+Toys?utm\_term=hot-rod-transformers-the-last-knight-deluxe-figure)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Transformers+The+Last+Knight+Toys?utm_term=hot-rod-transformers-the-last-knight-deluxe-figure"><img alt="transformers-the-last-knight-walmart-exclusive-autobots-unite-deluxe-autobot-hot-rod-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/transformers-the-last-knight-walmart-exclusive-autobots-unite-deluxe-autobot-hot-rod-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a massive fan of the Transformers franchise, I was thrilled to unbox the Deluxe Autobot Hot Rod figure from the movie The Last Knight. I eagerly anticipated playing with this sleek and powerful character, and I must say, it did not disappoint. The figure is expertly designed with both a robot mode and a stunning Lamborghini Centenario Car Mode, making it a perfect addition to my collection. 

One of the most impressive aspects of this figure is the transformation from robot to vehicle and back. The transformation process is intuitive and satisfying, making the figure fun to play with for both kids and adults alike. The vibrant colors and intricate details showcase the attention to design that went into creating this figure. 

However, one downside to this figure is its durability. As it relies on springs and cogs along with the right amount of force to actually convert, it can become quite delicate and prone to damage after only a few transformations. This could be an issue for families with younger children who may want to play with the figure more frequently. 

Still, for fans of Hot Rod or collectors of Transformers figures, this Deluxe Autobot figure is definitely worth adding to their collection. It's a quality toy that will provide hours of entertainment for those seeking the thrill of the Transformers universe. Whether displayed as a decorative piece or played with as an action figure, this figure will captivate your imagination and keep you coming back for more.

The Transformers Crosshairs The Last Knight Studio Series 92 Deluxe Class Figure is a must-have for any Transformers fan. The figure showcases Crosshairs in both robot and Corvette Stingray modes, with a Bowling Alley Quest backdrop to enhance the display. The transition between modes is a bit complicated, but ultimately satisfying once achieved. The figure's design closely resembles the character from the movie, with great attention to detail in both modes. 

One of the most noticeable features is the use of transparent plastic for some of the car parts, which can be quite challenging to attach due to its delicate nature. However, once assembled, the figure looks fantastic and captures the essence of the character perfectly. The included blaster accessories provide additional play value and allow for the recreation of iconic scenes from the movie. 

Age-appropriateness is important, and this figure makes for a great gift for children aged 8 and up. The figure does require some level of care, especially when handling car mode, as some parts tend to pop off more easily than desired. Overall, the Transformers Crosshairs The Last Knight Studio Series 92 Deluxe Class Figure is a delightful addition to any Transformers collection, with its stunning appearance, attention to detail, and unique transformation process.
