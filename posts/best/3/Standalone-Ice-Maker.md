### [Vevor Standalone Ice Maker with Large Storage & Intelligent Touch Screen](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Standalone+Ice+Maker?utm\_term=vevor-standalone-ice-maker-with-large-storage-intelligent-touch-screen)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Standalone+Ice+Maker?utm_term=vevor-standalone-ice-maker-with-large-storage-intelligent-touch-screen"><img alt="vevor-commercial-ice-makers-80-to-90lbs-per-24h-with-water-drain-pump-33lbs-storage-free-standing-co-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vevor-commercial-ice-makers-80-to-90lbs-per-24h-with-water-drain-pump-33lbs-storage-free-standing-co-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who tried this VEVOR Commercial Ice Maker, I have to say that it's been a game changer for my small construction company in Denver. My guys love having a cold cooler every day, and I can't imagine going back to buying ice for the whole summer. 

The powerful compressor ensures reliable performance, and while it does lower energy consumption, it can be a bit noisy at times. The ice storage of 33 pounds is generous, but I did notice that the ice comes out in large sheets, so I often have to smash it with the scoop. 

I've been using this ice maker for about two months, and it's been holding up well. I made some adjustments, like using a different filter and a pump with a drain, but overall, it's been easy to install and set up. The LCD control panel with buttons that are clear at a glance makes it easy to keep an eye on the machine's status. 

One issue I did encounter is that the machine stops making ice when it's full, but I just give it a half day and fire it back up. It also tends to fill up faster than advertised, but that's a minor inconvenience. 

In conclusion, this VEVOR Commercial Ice Maker has been a reliable and efficient addition to my business, providing us with fresh, cold ice every day. I'd recommend it to anyone in need of a large capacity standalone ice maker for their home or workplace.

The machine produces ice cubes in just a few minutes, which is great for parties or during hot summer days.

One feature that stood out to me was the see-through window, which allowed me to watch the ice being made. It's a nice touch that adds a bit of visual appeal to the appliance. However, the compact size of the machine and its portable nature means that it's not particularly sturdy, and it does tend to move around a bit when in use.

Additionally, standalone ice makers allow users to customize their ice preferences, including ice shapes and sizes.

Another benefit of using a standalone ice maker is the reduced likelihood of ice contamination.

Generally, an ice maker consumes between 750 to 1500 watts per hour, resulting in an operating cost of about $0.15 to $0.30 per hour. However, the overall cost of running a standalone ice maker is more affordable in the long run compared to purchasing pre-packaged ice or an ice cube dispenser.

These appliances come with detachable components like water reservoirs and ice bins, which can be removed and cleaned using mild detergent and water. Regular cleaning of the exterior and interior surfaces can help prevent the build-up of bacteria and fungi. To maintain the performance and reliability of your standalone ice maker, follow the manufacturer's recommended maintenance guidelines.
