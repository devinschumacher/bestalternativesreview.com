### [Deleter Manga Ink - Single White Printmaking Ink](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Printmaking+Inks?utm\_term=deleter-manga-ink-single-white-printmaking-ink)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Printmaking+Inks?utm_term=deleter-manga-ink-single-white-printmaking-ink"><img alt="deleter-manga-ink-white-1-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/deleter-manga-ink-white-1-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer, I've been using the Deleter Manga Ink - White 1 for quite some time now, and I must say, it's been a game-changer in my artworks. Despite being a bit water-based, it works great to white-out those pesky details and creates smooth lines that make my illustrations pop. The thin, smooth consistency allows me to layer it without fear of it clumping, and it dries with a nice matte finish. 

If you make a mistake, don't worry - you can wipe it off before it sets! It's easy to use, flows well, and is ideal for beginners. 

The only thing I'd like to point out is the need to shake the bottle well before use, as some settling happens. But overall, it's an excellent addition to my art supplies, and I'm sure many others will feel the same way! 


### [Speedball Essential Fabric Screen Printing Ink Set - Premium Quality Colors and Performance](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Printmaking+Inks?utm\_term=speedball-essential-fabric-screen-printing-ink-set-premium-quality-colors-and-performance)

I recently tried the Speedball Basic Colors Fabric Screen Printing Ink Set from Michaels, and I was blown away by the quality and versatility of these inks. The package contains a set of four 4oz jars in black, red, blue, and yellow hues. I was particularly impressed with the coverage and ease of application - the inks dried quickly and evenly, providing a smooth and vibrant finish. 

One of the standout features of these inks is their washfastness. When using them on fabrics, I found that they held up well after being washed and dried, without fading or smudging. The fact that these inks are non-flammable and have no offensive smell or solvents is a huge plus for safety-conscious users. 

As someone who enjoys experimenting with different techniques and mediums, I appreciated how these inks could be used in various ways. I could apply them with a brush or screen print, depending on the project at hand. The option to mix colors for even more vibrant shades was also a welcomed feature. 

However, one minor downside I noticed was that the inks can be slightly challenging to clean up - especially from skin or clothing. But overall, I'm thrilled with my purchase of the Speedball Basic Colors Fabric Screen Printing Ink Set and would highly recommend it to other artists and crafters looking for high-quality, versatile inks. 


### [Akua Intaglio Ink: High-Quality Printmaking Ink](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Printmaking+Inks?utm\_term=akua-intaglio-ink-high-quality-printmaking-ink)

Akua Intaglio Ink is a printmaker's delight, offering a variety of applications from intaglio to relief printmaking, monotype, and collagraphs. Formulated without driers, these soy-based inks allow for extended working time and easy cleanup, particularly with soap and water. 

In my personal experience, I found the colors to be rich and true to their pigments, though proper stirring ahead of use can prevent clumping. I also found the ink to be forgiving on different paper types, even producing visually striking outcomes with the addition of blending medium on gel plates. However, I did notice longer drying times compared to traditional water-based inks, which might require consideration, particularly in classroom settings. 

That being said, the ink's overall quality, versatility, and absence of chemicals make it a standout product for printmakers looking to elevate their work without needing harsh solvents or complicated prep methods.

As an artist, I've tried various types of printing ink over the years, but none stood out as much as the Speedball Oil Base Block Printing Ink in blue. The 8 oz ink tube is perfect for creating bold, vibrant prints on conventional surfaces. The inks have a smooth, rich consistency that makes it effortless to mix the hues just right, resulting in the full spectrum of rainbow colors. I particularly appreciate the fact that the Speedball inks are certified AP non-toxic, which gives me peace of mind when working with them in the classroom. 

The highlight of this product is its waterproof and archival quality, which makes the prints last longer without fading or smudging. One day, I used this blue ink on a wooden printmaking surface, and the result was nothing short of impressive - the ink dried quickly and created an intensely vivid blue hue. I also discovered that it's easy to clean up the ink using vegetable oil, which makes the overall process of creating art that much more enjoyable. 

Although there are some minor drawbacks such as the possibility of the ink drying out on top, this issue can be easily addressed by poking a hole in the dried layer with a screwdriver – not a major problem. And, while I wish the ink came in bigger tubes, I can't deny the value of its rich and versatile qualities. With this oil-based relief ink, I've been able to create amazing woodcut, linocut, and engraving works of art, which has significantly boosted my confidence as an artist. If you're looking for a high-quality, long-lasting ink that will add depth and richness to your printmaking endeavors, look no further than the Speedball Oil Base Block Printing Ink in blue.

Though the inks are best suited for 100% cotton fabric, you can experiment with other textures for varied results. Plus, the printed fabrics are washable up to 40°C. Overall, Essdee Fabric Printing Inks offer a fun and creative experience for fabric enthusiasts.

Another aspect of the Versatex Screen Printing Ink that users appreciate is its ability to print over light tones while being effective on heavy canvas or filmy blends.

### [Permaset Aqua Gold Lustre Fabric Printing Ink](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Printmaking+Inks?utm\_term=permaset-aqua-gold-lustre-fabric-printing-ink)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Printmaking+Inks?utm_term=permaset-aqua-gold-lustre-fabric-printing-ink"><img alt="permaset-aqua-1-litre-fabric-printing-ink-gold-lustre-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/permaset-aqua-1-litre-fabric-printing-ink-gold-lustre-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a long-time lover of fabric printing, I recently tried out Permaset Aqua's 1-liter Fabric Printing Ink in Gold Lustre. This was not my first foray into Permaset, and it certainly won't be my last. 

The ink offered impressive results on various fabrics, with minimal pre-treatment required. Whether using cotton, polyester, silk, or synthetics, the coverage was consistently intense, ensuring bright, opaque colors that would last even after numerous washes. 

One striking feature of Permaset Aqua is that it's eco-friendly; a rarity in such a competitive market. Its water-based formula makes cleaning up after use a breeze, without having to worry about the mess left behind. With a plethora of colors available, there's bound to be a shade that suits every project. 

However, it's not without its drawbacks. I found that the ink could prove a bit challenging to handle, particularly if you're not used to its thickness. It required a deft touch to avoid 'ink creep', but once mastered, the rewards were well worth the effort. 

The only concern I had was regarding its compatibility with darker fabrics, as some suggested it may not show up as vibrantly as desired. My experience, however, was different - the ink performed perfectly on dark fabrics, and its coverage remained exceptional. 

While it might sit a little heftier in the wallet compared to some other brands, the longevity, quality, and versatility of the ink truly make it a worthwhile investment. With its reputation for durability and vibrancy, Permaset Aqua Gold Lustre has become a staple in my fabric printing adventures - an experience I'd wholeheartedly recommend to anyone. 


### [Water Soluble Printmaking Ink for Classroom Use](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Printmaking+Inks?utm\_term=water-soluble-printmaking-ink-for-classroom-use)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Printmaking+Inks?utm_term=water-soluble-printmaking-ink-for-classroom-use"><img alt="speedball-water-soluble-block-printing-ink-5-oz-platinum-white-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/speedball-water-soluble-block-printing-ink-5-oz-platinum-white-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Oh, how I've grown to love this Speedball Water Soluble Block Printing Ink. The moment I cracked it open and dipped my printmaking block into the platinum white, I knew it was a winner! The ink is tacky and rich in hue, ensuring a smooth and even coverage on all types of printing surfaces. It was a dream to mix with other colors, creating some truly magical tints that dried surprisingly quick, even fast enough for classroom use. Using it on wooden, linoleum, or soft block surfaces felt like a breeze. 

However, it wasn't all smooth sailing, I did encounter some cons. I noticed that the binder in the tube had separated a bit, causing some difficulty in initial use. But once I got the hang of it, it was business as usual. The ink also took a little longer to dry for larger prints, but hey, these things happen even with the best of tools. Oh, and did I mention the ink is not suitable for relief prints that require time to ink thoroughly? That's a thing to remember, but not a deal-breaker. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, this platinum white has become my go-to for printmaking. It's a bit like a faithful companion on an artistic journey. And the best part? It washes off easily with just soap and water, making cleanup a breeze. It's safe to use in the classroom, and lightfastness is impressive, except for the fluorescents which have poor lightfastness. But hey, that's what makes a print unique, right?

What stood out to me is the kit's compatibility with high mesh counts, which has allowed me to achieve impressive levels of detail in my images. This feature has been a game-changer for me as an amateur printmaker, and I can see how professional artists would benefit from it as well. 

However, there is one aspect that has been slightly disappointing. I've found that occasionally, the inks can prove a bit stubborn when it comes to discharge printing. It might be due to the particular fabric or the specific discharge activator I'm using, but the discharge ink instructions could use some further clarification. 

Despite this issue, I've been genuinely pleased with my experience using the Ecotex Water-based Ink Kit, and I've been consistently impressed by the company's customer service. I can see how their commitment to answering questions and providing support for their products has earned the trust of many satisfied customers.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Printmaking+Inks?utm_term=professional-grade-water-soluble-block-printing-ink-for-versatile-usage"><img alt="speedball-water-soluble-block-printing-ink-black-5-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/speedball-water-soluble-block-printing-ink-black-5-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Speedball Water-Soluble Block Printing Ink for a while now and it's been quite a journey. Being a lover of all things creative, my days are spent experimenting with different colors and textures. At first, the ink seemed like a dream come true - rich, bold colors, smooth application, and most importantly, water-soluble, which means easy clean-up. But sometimes, all that glitters isn't gold. 

On the positive side, the coverage this ink provides is top-notch. Whether you're working on a large or small-scale project, the colors mix evenly and create a vibrant finish. It's also versatile; these inks are perfect for commercial, school, or personal use, and they've got you covered on different surfaces – from linoleum to wood and even some flexible printing plates. 

So why do I think it's not all gold? Well, there's the fast drying time. While it's great for those who want to get their projects done quickly, it can be a bit of a challenge for those of us who like to take their time and appreciate the process. It's not ideal for larger pieces, causing troubles with the ink drying out quickly. 

Additionally, the gold color is somewhat of a disappointment. Compared to other colors, it feels more sticky and slightly harder to work with. It's not always consistent in its pigmentation, making it harder to achieve a uniform effect. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, the Speedball Water-Soluble Block Printing Ink is definitely a worthy addition to any art kit. It provides a rich cover and vivid colors, making it a versatile tool for various projects. The ease of clean-up is a massive plus, and I'd definitely recommend this product to artists who are always on the lookout for new, interesting colors to experiment with.

### [Jacquard Versatex Printing Ink Set #1 for Vibrant Prints](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Printmaking+Inks?utm\_term=jacquard-versatex-printing-ink-set-1-for-vibrant-prints)

The non-toxic nature of these inks has been a delightful surprise, providing peace of mind as I use them in my home studio. The American-made Versatex inks offer a variety of techniques and colors, and it's amazing to see such diverse options within a single set. 

However, one downside I've encountered is the consistency of the inks. Some of the colors tend to clog, especially when working with a large mesh.

In terms of cleaning, the inks don't wash out easily, regardless of the technique used. Removing the ink from the screen requires more effort and time than expected. This is something I wish I could improve upon in future versions of the product.

I recently became acquainted with the Speedball Professional Relief Ink series, specifically the 8 oz tin of Titanium White. As a printmaking enthusiast, I was eager to incorporate this ink into my projects. 

The ink itself had a smooth, creamy consistency that made it easy to work with. The color was vibrant and true to its description, offering excellent coverage when applied to my printmaking plates. I appreciated the versatility of the ink, as it could be easily thinned with water for more transparent effects or stiffened with talc or magnesium carbonate for more opaque results. 

However, there was one aspect of the product that I found quite disagreeable. Upon opening the tin, I was met with a strong, almost overpowering chemical smell. It was so intense that it made me hesitant to continue working with the ink. Despite the fact that I have worked with many oil-based inks before, I had never encountered such a pungent odor. 

Another downside I discovered was the limited availability of the ink. The Titanium White shade is only available in a single size (8 oz/236.5 ml) and is not available in other colors that I typically use in my printmaking projects. This meant I had to purchase multiple tins of the same shade, which proved to be both inconvenient and costly.

By addressing the odor and expanding the color range in the future, the product could become a valuable addition to any printmaking studio.

Printmaking inks play a crucial role in achieving these beautiful prints, and in this buyer's guide, we will go through the essential features, considerations, and general advice for selecting the right printmaking ink for your needs. 


### Types of Printmaking Inks

There are various types of printmaking inks, including oil-based, water-based, and solvent-based. Oil-based inks are highly pigmented and suitable for creating rich, deep colors.

### Consider the Substrate

The substrate or material you intend to print on also plays a significant role in choosing the right ink. For paper, water-based inks are perfect, as they dry quickly and evenly. Oil-based inks are best suited for materials such as fabric or wood, producing vibrant, long-lasting prints. Always consider the properties of your chosen substrate when selecting an ink. 


### Ink Viscosity

Viscosity refers to the thickness or fluidity of the ink. Thicker inks are better for printing on textured surfaces, while thinner inks offer smoother coverage. Generally, beginners prefer thinner inks for easier application, while professionals may prefer thicker inks for greater control and opacity.
