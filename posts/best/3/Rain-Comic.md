Recently, I found myself engrossed in the comic, "After the Rain 1, " published by Vertical Comics. The tale of Akira Tachibana, a withdrawn high school student injured during a track and field competition, captivated me. Her transformation into a member of the staff at a family restaurant run by a kind-hearted middle-aged man, whose warmth eases her depression, drew me in. 

One of the most enjoyable aspects was witnessing the budding romance between Akira and her manager, despite the significant age difference. This storyline was both refreshing and tender, and I couldn't put the book down. However, I also noticed that the pacing of the story was noticeably slow at times, which made me lose interest on occasion. 

Overall, "After the Rain 1" provided an engaging and emotional read, with a heartwarming and romantic storyline. While it may be slow at times, the rich characters and plot make it an enjoyable comic to dive into.
