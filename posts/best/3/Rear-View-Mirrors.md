I recently had the chance to use the MODPRVMNA-C Axia 17" Wide Panoramic Rearview Mirror Chrome w/ No Arms, and I must say it has become one of my go-to accessories for driving. The unique curved design gives me a much wider view than traditional mirrors, allowing me to see more of what's behind me, without any distortion. 

What stood out the most, was the high-quality chrome finish that adds a touch of elegance to my ride. However, the lack of support arms can be a bit unconventional and might take some time getting used to. 

Despite the slight learning curve, the MODPRVMNA-C Axia has been a game changer for my driving experience, providing an unobstructed view of the road ahead.

One of the best features is the two video inputs – one for a backup camera and another for an additional camera view. I love the convenience of having all this information at my fingertips. The remote control for adjusting those parking lines is also super handy.

## Buyer's Guide

Rear view mirrors are essential accessories for any vehicle, as they help drivers see behind them, improve visibility, and reduce blind spots. With so many options available in the market, it can be challenging to choose the right one for your needs. In this buyer's guide, we will discuss the important features, considerations, and general advice for rear view mirrors to help you make an informed decision. 


### Types of Rear View Mirrors

There are three main types of rear view mirrors: traditional, convex, and digital. Traditional mirrors provide a clear and unobstructed view of the area behind the vehicle. Convex mirrors have a curved surface, which creates a wider field of view but can distort the image somewhat. Digital rear view mirrors use cameras to display a view of the area behind the vehicle, typically on a screen within the vehicle.

### Materials and Durability

The materials used to construct the mirror and its housing can significantly impact its durability. High-quality materials like stainless steel, acrylic, and polycarbonate are more resistant to corrosion, scratches, and breakage. Look for rear view mirrors with waterproof and shock-resistant features to ensure they can withstand harsh weather conditions and rough road surfaces. 


### Adjustability and Visibility

Adjustability is an essential factor when choosing a rear view mirror. Some models have swivel or tilt adjustments, while others may have a locking mechanism to prevent the mirror from moving when driving. Look for mirrors with high-quality optics that provide clear and accurate images, even in low-light conditions. This will ensure you have a precise view of the area behind your vehicle.

Fixed mirrors are typically less expensive and are easy to install, but they do not provide as much flexibility as adjustable or digital mirrors.

### What is the difference between a convex and a flat rear view mirror?

A convex rear view mirror is a curved mirror that provides a wider field of view compared to a flat mirror. This means that the driver can see more of their surroundings and any obstacles that may be lurking out of sight. The curved nature of the mirror also creates a distorted view, making it difficult to judge distances and sizes of objects in the mirror. 

A flat rear view mirror, on the other hand, provides a more accurate and realistic view of the surroundings. The flat mirror does not distort the image, making it easier for drivers to judge distances and sizes of objects. However, a flat mirror may not provide as wide of a field of view as a convex mirror. 


### Are rear view mirrors required by law in all vehicles?

No, rear view mirrors are not required by law in all vehicles. However, they are a common and important safety feature that is found in most vehicles today. Rear view mirrors are required by law in some jurisdictions, but not all. It is essential to check local laws and regulations to determine if a rear view mirror is required in your area. 

Overall, rear view mirrors are an important safety feature that can enhance the driving experience and provide a sense of security on the road. Whether they are required by law or not, rear view mirrors are a wise investment for any vehicle owner, providing better visibility and improved safety for all.
