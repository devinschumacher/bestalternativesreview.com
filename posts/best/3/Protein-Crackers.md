<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Protein+Crackers?utm_term=flax-seed-protein-crackers-gluten-free-non-gmo-organic-vegan-high-in-omega-3s"><img alt="flackers-organic-flax-seed-crackers-sea-salt-5-oz-bags-4-pack-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/flackers-organic-flax-seed-crackers-sea-salt-5-oz-bags-4-pack-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try Flackers Organic Flax Seed Crackers in the Sea Salt flavor. [As someone who's always on the lookout for healthy and tasty snacks, I was eager to give these a try.](https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativereviews.com/https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativesreview.com/blob/main/posts/best/1/Combos.md) 

First off, I appreciated the fact that these crackers are made from the highest quality USDA Certified and Non GMO Project Verified organic flax seeds, which have been germinated to increase their nutritional value. This made me feel good about including these in my daily snack routine. 

One of the things that stood out to me was the crunchiness of the crackers. They were satisfyingly crisp, which made them a great alternative to traditional potato or wheat-based crackers. The sea salt flavor was also quite pleasant, providing just the right amount of saltiness to complement the nutty taste of the flax seeds. 

However, there were a couple of downsides to my experience with Flackers. The first was the smell when I first opened the bag. It was quite strong and almost off-putting, which made me a bit apprehensive about trying the crackers. But once I took a bite, the smell dissipated, and I was able to enjoy the taste. 

The second issue I had was with the texture. While the crackers were crunchy, they were also quite dry and brittle. This made them a bit difficult to eat and left a dusty residue on my fingers. 

Overall, I think Flackers Organic Flax Seed Crackers are a decent option for those looking for a healthier, gluten-free snack. The sea salt flavor was enjoyable, and the crackers were satisfyingly crunchy. However, the strong smell and dry texture may deter some people from giving them a try.

You can't help but feel guilty as you munch away, comforted by the fact that these tasty little puffs are guilt-free - a perfect companion for a health-conscious snacker.

The fact that the puffs are low in sugar, low in fat, and packed with complete protein is another major win. It's not often that we get to indulge in snacks that are not only enjoyable but also beneficial to our health. 

However, there are always a couple of drawbacks that are worth mentioning. For starters, the puffs can be rather small. While I appreciate their tiny size, as it makes it easier to control portion sizing, it's somewhat deceiving, particularly when you pay a lot for what seems to be a relatively meager portion. Secondly, I've found the aftertaste of these protein puffs to be a little underwhelming. There's just a slight hint of 'protein', which isn't entirely unpleasant but not exactly what I'd expect from a snack that's so highly touted as a protein-rich alternative. 

Nevertheless, Twin Peaks Jalapeno Cheddar Protein Puffs deliver when it comes to providing a healthier, more flavorsome take on the classic potato chip. It's a snack that's perfect for those who want to treat themselves without sacrificing their dietary goals. Despite its minor shortcomings, it remains a decent option for anyone seeking a crunchier, guilt-free alternative to their favorite snacks.

They deliver an impressive 21g of protein per serving and only 2g of carbs. They're perfect for use as a salad topper, trail mix energizer, or a satisfying snack. One thing I love about these protein puffs is that they're low in carbs and fats, fitting into almost any diet! 

However, they do carry a higher price point than some other snacks. I've heard some people complain about certain flavors not delivering on their promised strength or balance. I tried a variety of flavors and, while I found all of them enjoyable, I think the garlic parmesan one might have been a tad too strong for my taste. 

But overall, the Twin Peaks Protein Puffs were a delightful addition to my daily life. They provided the much-needed protein boost in a tasty, snack form. I've been using them as a reward after workouts too, as they're a great high-protein snack option when I'm looking to refuel. Even though they're a little higher on the price spectrum, for the taste and quality I experienced, they're well worth the investment in my opinion.
