### [Electric Broadcast Spreader with Cable Control for Seed, Fertilizer, and Ice Melt](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Seed+Spreader?utm\_term=electric-broadcast-spreader-with-cable-control-for-seed-fertilizer-and-ice-melt)

The direct drive 12V electric motor combined with the sealed wiring harness made it super easy to hook up to my mower's battery.

### [Heavy-Duty ATV 125-Pound Receiver Mount Seed Spreader](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Seed+Spreader?utm\_term=heavy-duty-atv-125-pound-receiver-mount-seed-spreader)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Seed+Spreader?utm_term=heavy-duty-atv-125-pound-receiver-mount-seed-spreader"><img alt="field-tuff-receiver-mount-spreader-125-lbs-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/field-tuff-receiver-mount-spreader-125-lbs-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Field Tuff 125-lb Receiver Mount Spreader, and overall, it performed really well. I used it to spread grass seed, fertilizer, and small grains, and it did a great job of covering a wide area with a broadcast width of 12'. The 12V motor had a rated speed of 570 RPM, which was powerful enough to handle even the thickest materials. 

One thing that impressed me was how easy it was to mount the spreader to my ATV, UTV, or utility tractor. The spreader conveniently comes with an on/off power switch, which made it really easy to operate. However, there were some downsides too. The motor seemed to struggle with a full hopper, and I had to manually turn the plate a few times to get it going again. 

Another issue was the controls being mounted on the spreader itself. While it worked fine on a small 4-wheeler, using it from a side-by-side or truck required me to disconnect it and use a longer cable. Lastly, the spreader came with pretty detailed instructions, but they could have been clearer when it came to assembling it. 

Overall, I think this spreader is a great tool for anyone looking to spread seeds or fertilizers over a large area. It's easy to use and mount, but it does have a few drawbacks that you should be aware of. If you can overlook these small issues, the Field Tuff 125-lb Receiver Mount Spreader is definitely worth considering.

## Buyer's Guide

A seed spreader is an essential tool for gardeners and landscapers who want to sow grass seed, wildflower seeds, or other types of seeds in their outdoor spaces. This buyer's guide will help you understand the key features to look for in a seed spreader and provide general advice on how to choose the right one for your needs. By following our tips, you'll be well-equipped to make an informed purchase and enjoy a successful seed-planting experience. 


### Size and capacity

Consider the size and capacity of the seed spreader based on the area you want to cover. Larger spreaders typically have greater capacity, making them more suitable for larger projects. However, smaller spreaders may be more convenient for tight spaces or smaller areas. Make sure to select a spreader that can comfortably cover the desired area without wasting seeds or requiring frequent refills. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Seed+Spreader"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Seed-Spreader-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Seed-Spreader-2" height="540"></a></div>


### Seed container material

The material of the seed container affects the spreader's durability and performance. Polymer or plastic containers are lightweight and resistant to corrosion, while metal containers provide better durability but may require more maintenance. Consider your budget, the environment in which you'll use the spreader, and the seeds you'll be planting when choosing the appropriate material for the seed container. 


### Seed spreading mechanism

Seed spreaders use either a broadcast or drop spreading mechanism. Broadcast spreaders distribute seeds in a wide, fan-like pattern, which is ideal for sowing seeds evenly over large areas. Drop spreaders, on the other hand, release seeds in a narrow, more precise pattern, making them suitable for smaller, more targeted projects. Choose a seed spreader with the appropriate spreading mechanism based on the nature of your project and the desired seed distribution pattern. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Seed+Spreader"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Seed-Spreader-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Seed-Spreader-3" height="540"></a></div>


### Ease of use and maintenance

Consider how easy the seed spreader is to use and maintain. Look for features such as easy-to-adjust settings, comfortable handles, and simple cleaning procedures. Additionally, consider if the spreader requires any special tools or parts for maintenance or repair. By selecting a seed spreader that is user-friendly and easy to maintain, you'll enhance your overall experience and ensure the longevity of the product.

### What is a seed spreader used for?

A seed spreader is a versatile tool that is used for accurately distributing seeds, fertilizers, and other granular products such as mulch and lime over large or densely planted areas. It can be used for both residential and commercial purposes and helps in achieving even and thorough coverage, leading to better germination and plant growth. 

There are different types of seed spreaders, including hand-held, push-behind, and tow-behind models, each suitable for specific applications. Hand-held spreaders are typically best for smaller lawns or gardens, while larger, tow-behind models are better suited for large-scale commercial or industrial projects. 


### How does a seed spreader work?

A seed spreader typically works by having a hopper or storage container filled with the desired granular material. The hopper is connected to an agitator or distributor mechanism that controls the flow of the material out of the hopper and onto the ground. This mechanism can be adjusted to regulate the rate of distribution, allowing the user to control the amount of material released onto the ground. 

The spreader can be moved across the area to be treated, either by hand, while pushing a handle, or by towing it behind a vehicle. The spreader's adjustable spreading pattern and rate control help ensure consistent coverage and even distribution of the material. This results in a uniform application, promoting healthy plant growth while minimizing waste. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Seed+Spreader"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Seed-Spreader-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Seed-Spreader-5" height="540"></a></div>


### What types of seed spreaders are available?

There are several types of seed spreaders available, each designed for specific applications. The main types include hand-held, push-behind, and tow-behind spreaders. Hand-held spreaders are small and portable, making them suitable for smaller lawns or gardens. Push-behind spreaders are slightly larger and can be pulled behind a user, making them more suitable for medium-sized lawns or larger gardens. Tow-behind spreaders are the largest and are typically used for large-scale commercial or industrial projects. 

There are also various features that can be found on seed spreaders, such as adjustable spreading patterns, different hopper capacities, and compatibility with different types of materials. Some seed spreaders can also use different types of power sources, including battery, gas, or electric, to help improve their performance and convenience. 


### What should I consider when choosing a seed spreader?

When choosing a seed spreader, you should consider several factors to ensure that you select the right tool for your needs. These factors include the size of the area you need to treat, the type of material you will be spreading (seeds, fertilizer, mulch, etc. ), and the frequency with which you plan to use the spreader. 

Other factors to consider include the hopper capacity, the type of power source (battery, gas, or electric), and the adjustability of the spreading pattern and rate control. You should also consider the durability and ease of use of the spreader, as well as any additional features that may be beneficial for your specific application. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Seed+Spreader"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Seed-Spreader-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Seed-Spreader-6" height="540"></a></div>


### How do I maintain and troubleshoot my seed spreader?

To maintain your seed spreader and ensure it operates correctly, you should regularly clean and inspect it. This includes checking for any visible damage, tightening any loose parts, and ensuring that all screws and fasteners are properly secured. It is also essential to clean the hopper and agitator mechanism after each use, removing any residual material. 

If you experience any issues with your seed spreader, such as uneven distribution or clogging, you should first refer to the user manual for troubleshooting tips. If the problem persists, it may be necessary to contact the manufacturer or dealer for further assistance or to schedule maintenance or repair services. 


### Can a seed spreader be used for other granular products besides seeds?

Yes, a seed spreader can be used for various granular products, such as fertilizers, mulch, and lime. Most seed spreaders are designed to handle a range of materials, and their adjustable spreading patterns and rate control allow for flexibility in applying different products. Some spreaders may also have specific features or attachments designed for use with particular materials, but most can handle multiple types of granular products as long as they are appropriate for the spreader's capacity and compatibility. 

It is essential to consult the manufacturer's guidelines to ensure that the spreader you are using is suitable for the specific granular product you plan to apply. Using the wrong material can lead to clogging, damage to the spreader, or unsatisfactory results in your lawn or garden. Always follow the recommended guidelines and adjust the settings as needed to achieve the desired outcome.
