### [Roxy Iodine Blue Springsuit Long Sleeve Women's Wetsuit](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Roxy+Wetsuit?utm\_term=roxy-iodine-blue-springsuit-long-sleeve-womens-wetsuit)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Roxy+Wetsuit?utm_term=roxy-iodine-blue-springsuit-long-sleeve-womens-wetsuit"><img alt="roxy-rise-1-5mm-springsuit-long-sleeve-back-zip-wetsuit-womens-iodine-blue-5" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/roxy-rise-1-5mm-springsuit-long-sleeve-back-zip-wetsuit-womens-iodine-blue-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Recently, I had the pleasure of trying on the ROXY Rise 1.5mm long-sleeve springsuit in the Iodine Blue shade. The first thing that caught my attention was the stylish color-blocked design, which added a touch of flair to my usual wetsuit look. 

Slipping it on was a breeze, thanks to the easy back-zip entry system with a robust YKK number 10 plastic zip. The neoprene material was soft and comfy, with a lightweight feel that made me feel like I was wearing a cloud. 

One feature I truly appreciated was the Hydrowrap neckline and flush lock seals, which kept me snug and dry while swimming in the cool waters. It was fantastic to have this added level of protection and comfort. 

On the downside, I did find that the zippered back pocket was a bit small, making it tricky to store all my extra gear. Additionally, the silicone leg lock could be a bit sticky at times, which required a bit of extra effort to get the suit off after a long day in the water. 

Overall, the ROXY Rise long-sleeve springsuit proved to be a reliable and stylish choice for those looking to stay comfortable in cool waters. Despite its minor drawbacks, this wetsuit provided plenty of perks that made it a win in my book.

## Buyer's Guide

Choosing the right Roxy wetsuit can be a daunting task, considering the various factors that come into play. This buyer's guide will help you navigate through the process, providing essential information about the different aspects of Roxy wetsuits. 


### Material

The material used in a Roxy wetsuit plays a significant role in its overall performance. High-quality neoprene is the most common material, offering both warmth and flexibility. Different wetsuits may utilize various blends of neoprene to optimize their specific functions.

### Stitching

The stitching of a wetsuit is crucial for its durability and waterproof capabilities. Look for wetsuits with double- or triple-stitched seams that prevent water from entering through the gaps. Additionally, seam-sealing is often applied to improve the waterproofness of a wetsuit. Make sure to consider these features when selecting a Roxy wetsuit. 


### Fit and Comfort

Comfort is key when choosing a Roxy wetsuit. It should fit snugly but not restrict your movements. The most common fit types for wetsuits are tight-fitting neoprene suits, semi-dry suits with a thin layer of foam, and full-dry suits with waterproof zippers and sealed seams. Consider your activity level and intended use when selecting the appropriate fit and comfort level for your wetsuit.

### Features and Design

Roxy wetsuits often come with various features designed to enhance your surfing experience. Look for a wetsuit with a comfortable collar, easy-to-use zippers, and strategically placed pockets and wrist cuffs for added convenience. Some wetsuits may also feature a key pocket, UV protection, or compression lining for improved blood circulation.

### What makes a Roxy wetsuit unique?

A Roxy wetsuit stands out from other brands due to its design, performance, and materials. Roxy wetsuits are specifically designed for women, ensuring a comfortable and flattering fit. They feature advanced technology and construction methods, providing optimal thermal insulation and flexibility. The brand also prioritizes sustainable materials and production processes for a green approach to their products. 

Roxy’s dedication to innovation and quality creates wetsuits that not only perform well but also look fantastic. Their unique prints, color schemes, and patterns cater to diverse personal tastes and preferences, making them unique and well-suited for various water activities and water sports enthusiasts. 


### What materials are used to construct a Roxy wetsuit?

Roxy wetsuits are made using high-quality materials to ensure durability, flexibility, and warmth. The core component of these wetsuits is neoprene, which is a synthetic rubber derived from petroleum. They typically use 3mm or 5mm thick neoprene, providing insulation and resistance to water. To increase the suit’s breathability, the wetsuit also includes neoprene panels with stretch lining or nylon bonded to the neoprene. 

Other materials used in Roxy wetsuits include Polyethylene Naphthalate (PEN) and limestone (a recycled and eco-friendly additive), both of which help to minimize the environmental impact. The brand also includes other eco-conscious features such as recycled Yulex™ natural rubber in some of their wetsuits.

### How should I measure for a Roxy wetsuit?

Measuring for a Roxy wetsuit is similar to measuring for any other wetsuit. You'll need to gather some key body measurements, such as your chest, waist, hips, and inseam (the measurement from your ankle to the top of your thigh). To ensure the most accurate measurements, you should use a soft tape measure instead of string or flexible ruler. 

You can also rely on sizing charts provided by the brand or retailer. Roxy typically offers wetsuits in sizes ranging from XXS to L, allowing you to choose the right size based on your chest and waist measurements. For a better fit, double-check which measurements the brand or retailer focuses on when providing their sizing guide. 


### What types of wetsuits does Roxy offer?

Roxy offers a diverse range of wetsuits catering to different water activities, such as surfing, swimming, or other water sports. Their wetsuit collection includes seamless, full and long-sleeve models, each designed to provide warmth, comfort, and flexibility. They also offer wetsuits with varying thicknesses (neoprene thickness) to cater to different water temperatures and individual preferences. 

Additionally, Roxy is committed to sustainability. They have introduced eco-friendly wetsuits, which use less neoprene and are made with sustainable materials such as Yulex natural rubber and limestone. These eco-friendly wetsuits prioritize reduced material usage, emissions, and waste in production.

### How long will a Roxy wetsuit last?

The lifespan of a Roxy wetsuit depends on multiple factors, such as usage, maintenance, and environmental conditions. Proper care can help extend the wetsuit's lifespan. After use, rinse the wetsuit thoroughly in fresh water to remove salt, sand, and chlorine. For long-term storage, dry the wetsuit and hang it, ensuring no folds or wrinkles to avoid damage. 

With regular cleaning and storage, a Roxy wetsuit can last for several years. However, regular use, exposure to sunlight, and rough treatment can cause deterioration in the suit's material, resulting in reduced wear time. A high-quality wetsuit from a reputable brand like Roxy should give you good value for your money with proper maintenance. 


### Can I use a Roxy wetsuit for different water sports?

Roxy wetsuits are designed for a variety of water sports and activities, including surfing, swimming, and diving. Their diverse range of wetsuit models ensures they cater to different needs and preferences, with features and materials specific to each use case. For example, a surfer might prefer a wetsuit with additional stretch for freedom of movement, while a swimmer might require a more streamlined design for less resistance. 

Regardless of your water activity, a Roxy wetsuit offers great thermal insulation, flexibility, and style. You can find several wetsuits within their collection that will work for your specific water sport, making Roxy an excellent option for individuals looking for a versatile wetsuit brand. Always check the recommended usage of the specific wetsuit model you're eyeing to ensure it aligns with your water sport of choice.
