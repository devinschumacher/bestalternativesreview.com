<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Picatinny+Iron+Sights?utm_term=landslide-plus-picatinny-sight-with-av-31-scope-for-hunters-bow"><img alt="axcel-landslyde-plus-picatinny-sight-av-31-1-pin-019-green-rh-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/axcel-landslyde-plus-picatinny-sight-av-31-1-pin-019-green-rh-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the opportunity to try out the Axcel Landslide Plus Picatinny Sight AV-31, and let me tell you, it exceeded my expectations. I was immediately drawn to the slider sight's rapid adjust knob and quick release mechanism, which allowed me to easily slide the sight up and down along precision-made gear teeth for fine-tuned yardage settings. One of the standout features was the adjustable dead stop, which made it a breeze to quickly access 20 yards or any other yardage setting. 

The sight's two individually adjustable pointers were a game-changer for me, making precise shots a breeze, and the super-rugged double-sided metal sight tapes with 8 metal tapes and 16 scales were surprisingly resilient and easy to use. The first, second, and third axis adjustments were all true, easily accessible, and independently adjustable, which further added to the sight's accuracy and versatility. 

One of my favorite aspects of this sight was the quick adjust Rheostate cover, which dimmed the fiber optic pins from star bursting in direct sunlight, providing me with a clearer and more focused view even on the brightest days. My experience with the scope, equipped with a 1 3/8" or 31MM inside diameter and a CCT technology aiming ring, was nothing short of impressive. 

The Picatinny in-line sight mount made it easy to attach the sight to the front of my bow, creating a strong and durable connection for optimal balance. The ability to adjust the sight in or out to one of three positions not only enhanced my hunting experience but also allowed me to easily match the peep sight to the scope housing or up or down to one of three positions on the bow riser for elevation adjustments. 

Overall, my experience with the Axcel Landslide Plus Picatinny Sight AV-31 has been nothing short of phenomenal, and I highly recommend it to any avid hunter looking for superior accuracy and ease of use in their sight.

However, there were a couple of downsides to my experience with the Fast Eddie PM. First, I found the horizontal micro adjustments to be a bit tricky, especially when I was trying to make quick adjustments in the field. Lastly, while I appreciated the quick disconnect 3rd axis adapter, I wished it came with a few more adjustment options for a more personalized fit. 

Overall, if you're looking for a lightweight, durable, and accurate sight, the Spot Hogg Fast Eddie PM might be just what you need. But be prepared to encounter some challenges when it comes to its horizontal micro adjustments.
