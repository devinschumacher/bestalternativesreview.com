The sound quality is fantastic, offering a clear, crisp audio experience that has impressed everyone I've shared it with. Additionally, the noise cancellation technology effectively blocks out unwanted noise, which is perfect for working from home or commuting. 

However, one minor caveat is that the ear cups feel a bit tight on my ears, and I may need to order a replacement size.

Other than these minor nitpicks, I'm thoroughly satisfied with the Status Core ANC headphones and consider them a steal at their price point. They've already become a staple in my daily life, and I can't imagine going back to using less comfortable headphones.
