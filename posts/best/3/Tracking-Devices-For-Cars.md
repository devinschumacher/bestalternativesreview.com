### [Tunaves Magnetic Car Tracker - No Monthly Fees, Multi-function GPS](https://serp.ly/amazon/Tracking+Devices+For+Cars?utm\_term=tunaves-magnetic-car-tracker-no-monthly-fees-multi-function-gps)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Tracking+Devices+For+Cars?utm_term=tunaves-magnetic-car-tracker-no-monthly-fees-multi-function-gps"><img alt="tunaves-gps-tracker-for-vehicles-strong-magnetic-car-vehicle-tracking-anti-lost-no-monthly-fee-no-su-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tunaves-gps-tracker-for-vehicles-strong-magnetic-car-vehicle-tracking-anti-lost-no-monthly-fee-no-su-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Tunaves GPS Tracker for Vehicles, and it has been pretty handy in my daily life. Whenever I need to keep an eye on my car or any other vehicle, this little device comes in handy. 

One of the most impressive features of this tracker is the built-in FPS antenna that ensures accurate positioning, making it perfect for logistics transportation, fleet supervision, or even pet anti-lost scenarios. 

However, I found the battery life to be a bit shorter than expected. It's got a built-in high-energy lithium battery, but when it's low, it sends a low battery alarm to the host reminding you to charge it. 

But what I love most about this tracker is its silent mode function. It automatically records sound above 30 decibels and uploads it to the cloud for storage, which is great for car safety. 

Despite its size being smaller than a coin, it's convenient to carry around and can be placed in more spots. Plus, strong magnetic adsorption makes it easy to install and use without needing any extra installation. 

Overall, this GPS tracker has been a useful addition to my life, helping me keep an eye on my vehicles and ensuring their safety.

It is commonly used for car tracking devices to monitor teenage drivers, track valuables, and ensure vehicle safety. 

Geofencing works by using GPS technology to detect when a car tracking device crosses a defined boundary. The geofencing feature is programmed into the tracking device's web-based platform or mobile app, allowing the user to receive notifications or be alerted when the car exits or enters the specified area. This feature helps car owners maintain better control over their vehicles and receive timely alerts in case of theft, unauthorized access, or location breaches.
