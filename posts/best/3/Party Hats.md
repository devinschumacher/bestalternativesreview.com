### [Fun and Playful Cat-Themed Millstone Birthday Party Hats](https://serp.ly/amazon/Party+Hats?utm\_term=fun-and-playful-cat-themed-millstone-birthday-party-hats)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Party+Hats?utm_term=fun-and-playful-cat-themed-millstone-birthday-party-hats"><img alt="over-the-hill-party-animal-cone-hats-8ct-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/over-the-hill-party-animal-cone-hats-8ct-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer, I have to say, these Over the Hill Party Hats definitely lived up to their name - they were quite the party animals! With their vibrant pom-poms, triangles, and adorable cat and dog cutouts, they certainly brought a lot of energy to any party. 

One of the standout features was the multicolor design - it helped add a touch of brightness to any outfit or table setting. The material was also a plus, making these hats both lightweight and durable for repeated use. 

However, I did notice a slight disadvantage: the pom-poms weren't quite as full as they appeared in the product photos. It wasn't a major deal-breaker, but it did take away from their initial charm a bit. 

Overall, I think these party hats would be a hit at any birthday celebration or gathering. Just remember to set the right expectations for the pom-poms beforehand, and you'll have a blast wearing these playful hats!

The Blueberry Hat is a vibrant and eye-catching accessory, perfect for any festive occasion. Made of high-quality materials and designed to last, this hat adds a touch of fun to any outfit. 

The adjustable strap means it fits most head sizes comfortably, making it a versatile choice. During a recent party, I noticed heads turning as soon as I arrived, and the compliment I received on the hat was overwhelming. 

However, I must say that it can be a bit challenging to store when not in use due to its size. Overall, the Blueberry Hat is a must-have for any woman looking to make a statement at their next event.

### [Cat in the Hat Paper Hats - Themed Birthday Party Supplies](https://serp.ly/amazon/Party+Hats?utm\_term=cat-in-the-hat-paper-hats-themed-birthday-party-supplies)

When I recently hosted a Dr. Seuss-themed birthday party, I decided to add a touch of fun with these Cat in the Hat Paper Hats. These small hats for kids feature a distinctive red and white top hat design, which is perfect for themed events like a Dr. Seuss party or even school parties. 

Each hat has an 8-inch diameter and is 8 inches tall, making them a one-size-fit-most. I was impressed by the variety provided in the set - with 36 hats, there were enough for all the kids to have their own hat, which made the party even more special. The Dr. Seuss costumes really added to the excitement, and the kids had a blast posing for photos wearing their new hats. 

Made from cardstock, these paper hats are not only colorful but also sturdy enough to hold up during playtime. However, I noticed that a few of the hats started tearing along the edges, so it's good to have some tape handy for emergencies. 

My only concern is the packaging's claim that there are 36 hats in the set. There were a few hats missing, which left me with just 32 for my class. It may not be a major issue, but it's something to be aware of if you have a lot of kids attending your event. 

Overall, these Cat in the Hat Paper Hats were a fun and affordable addition to our party, providing kids with an imaginative way to celebrate our favorite whimsical author. Just remember to be prepared with some tape, and you'll have a colorful and memorable event.

## Buyer's Guide

Embellishing a party with the appropriate party hats can elevate the joyous atmosphere, transforming the fun factor to a higher level. To assist you in making an informed decision, here are some essential factors and advice to consider when purchasing party hats, ensuring your guests have a fantastic time.


### Material

A spectrum of materials can be explored when it comes to party hats. Popular options include foam, plastic, and paper. Each material has its perks, but durability might hold considerable weight in your choice. Foam and plastic party hats tend to endure longer than paper hats, rendering them optimal for outdoor events and consecutive celebrations.

### Design and Theme

Bear the theme of your party in mind while deciding on the party hats. Famous themes incorporate animal masks, superheroes, princesses and several others. Harmonizing the party hats with your party's theme can add an element of cohesion to the event, enriching the overall ambiance. Do remember to select hats that cater to different age groups of your guests. 


### Size and Adjustability

Ensuring the party hats fit your guests correctly is key. Measure the head circumference of each child to ascertain the apt size. The party hats must be adjustable, featuring an elastic or ribbon band that can be simply adjusted to accommodate different head sizes. This ensures that your guests are comfortable wearing their party hats and can wholeheartedly participate in the festivities.

### Pricing

Party hats are available in various price points, ranging from inexpensive disposable choices to more enduring, high-priced options. Factor the number of guests attending and your budget into your decision. Party hats might be purchased for a couple of dollars per piece, while more elaborate, high-quality party hats may cost around $10 or more. Ponder whether you want to invest in reusable, long-lasting party hats that can be used annually or opt for more affordable, disposable options for one-time usage.

### What are the different types of party hats available?

There are a variety of different types of party hats available on the market. Some common styles include cone-shaped hats, which are the most traditional and recognizable style of party hat. These hats usually feature a wide brim at the bottom and taper towards the top, creating a cone-like shape. Some cone-shaped hats may also feature additional accessories or decorations, such as bells, pom-poms, or confetti. 

Another popular type of party hat is the flat-bottom or round-bottom hat. These hats have a wider, more evenly shaped brim at the bottom, giving them a different look than cone-shaped hats. Flat-bottom hats often have a more modern or contemporary feel, and may be designed with more intricate patterns or designs. Some flat-bottom hats may also feature additional features, such as lights or sounds, which can add an extra element of fun to your celebration. 


### What materials are party hats made of?

Party hats are typically made from paper or cardboard materials. These materials are lightweight, inexpensive, and easy to work with, making them popular choices for creating party hats. Some party hats may also be made from foam or plastic materials, which can provide added durability and resistance to wear and tear. 

Regardless of the material used, party hats are designed to be disposable and recyclable, making them an environmentally friendly option for your celebration. Additionally, the materials used to make party hats can often be customized to match the theme or color scheme of your event, providing a personalized touch to your festivities.

### How many party hats should I buy for my event?

The number of party hats you should buy for your event will depend on several factors, including the size of your guest list, the age range of your guests, and the overall theme and style of your celebration. As a general rule of thumb, it's a good idea to have one party hat per guest, so that everyone can participate in the fun and join in the festivities. 

However, you may want to consider purchasing a few extra party hats, just in case some guests forget to bring their own or in case of any unexpected guests. It's always better to have too many party hats than not enough, so that everyone can join in the fun and create lasting memories together. Additionally, having extra party hats on hand can also provide a backup option if any of your guests' hats become damaged or lost during the celebration. 


### How much do party hats typically cost?

The cost of party hats can vary depending on several factors, including the type of hat, the size of the order, and the materials used. In general, however, party hats are a relatively inexpensive accessory that can add a fun and festive touch to your celebration without breaking the bank. Many party hats can be purchased for a few dollars per unit, making them a budget-friendly option for most events. 

Additionally, if you are purchasing party hats in bulk for a larger event or as part of a party pack, you may be able to find discounts or bulk pricing options, which can help you save even more money. Be sure to compare prices and options from different vendors to ensure that you are getting the best deal for your money.
