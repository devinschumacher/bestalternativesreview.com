Last Sunday, I decided to take my kids to a soccer match where I noticed a kid wearing a vintage Troy Polamalu Pittsburgh Steelers jersey. The jersey instantly caught my attention as it was unique and eye-catching. Being a fan of the Steelers, I just had to know more about it. After the match, I went up to the kid and asked where he got it from. To my surprise, he said he got it from a Mitchell & Ness store. The very next day, I went to the store and bought one for my son too!
