However, I did notice a slight decrease in water pressure from the cold side. It wasn't significant, but it still made filling a pot or a glass take a bit longer. But considering I didn't have to constantly refill a separate filter pitcher, it was a fair trade-off. 

Another aspect I appreciated was the indicator light. It gave me a heads up when it was time to change the filter, so I wouldn't have to guess or forget. Overall, the Pentair FreshPoint Easy Flow Under Sink Water Filtration System made my life easier, and the cleaner water was a bonus.

I recently tried the Brita Water Filtration System, and I have to say, it's been a game-changer for me. The water pitcher is small and compact, making it perfect for storing in tight spaces. The filter indicator is a helpful feature that reminds me when it's time to replace the filter, ensuring optimal performance. 

One of the things that stood out to me was how much this system has helped reduce waste. With one Brita water filter, I've been able to replace up to 300 standard water bottles, which is not only great for the environment but also saves me money. 

The BPA-free pitcher has a locking lid that makes it easy to pour water without making a mess, and the compact 5-cup capacity is perfect for a small kitchen or office. The filter is easy to change every 40 gallons or so, which is about two months for the average household. 

On the downside, the directions can be a bit confusing at times, and I've noticed that the lid doesn't always fit securely. However, overall, I'm happy with the product and the improvements it's made to the quality of the water I drink.
