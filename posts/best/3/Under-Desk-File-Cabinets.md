<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Under+Desk+File+Cabinets?utm_term=premium-black-mobile-filing-cabinet-with-hidden-drawer-swivel-casters"><img alt="hirsh-20-inch-deep-mobile-zip-pedestal-2-drawer-box-file-hidden-drawer-black-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hirsh-20-inch-deep-mobile-zip-pedestal-2-drawer-box-file-hidden-drawer-black-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on this Hirsh 20-inch Deep Mobile Zip Pedestal Cabinet, and let me tell you, it's a real game-changer in my workspace. The black color lends a sleek look that seamlessly blends in with the rest of the office decor. 

One thing that really stood out for me was the construction. It's sturdy as a rock, with a fully assembled steel frame and a non-porous surface. As someone who appreciates cleanliness, I love how easy it is to keep the cabinet clean. 

The cabinet isn't just a pretty face, it's also functional. It comes with five swivel casters, two of which lock, making it super easy to move around when needed. The fifth caster under the drawer eliminates the need for any extra counterweight, which is a nice touch. 

The cabinet has a lot of storage space. It has a main drawer that can accommodate letter- or legal-sized files, which is perfect for my business needs. But what really caught my attention was the second hidden drawer on the inside. It's the perfect size for storing office essentials off my desk, keeping my workspace clutter-free. 

The drawers are a delight to use. They feature convenient extended drawer fronts and full-width drawer pulls, making them easy to open and close. The precision ball bearing suspension and full drawer extension on each drawer ensure smooth operation and easy access to the files I need. 

The only downside I experienced was that it required a bit of lubricant, WD40, to get the squeaks out and to get the lock to turn. But that's a minor issue considering the benefits of this cabinet. 

Overall, if you're looking for a durable, easy-to-use, and aesthetically pleasing file cabinet, this Hirsh 20-inch Deep Mobile Zip Pedestal Cabinet is definitely worth a look. It's a reliable addition to any office space.

## Buyer's Guide

Under desk file cabinets are excellent space-saving solutions for storing documents, supplies, and more. In this buyer's guide section, we'll discuss important features to consider, common concerns, and general advice to help you find the best fit for your needs. 


### Size and Capacity

When shopping for an under desk file cabinet, consider the size of the unit and how much storage space you need. Pay attention to the width, depth, and height dimensions, as well as the overall capacity in terms of drawers or compartments. Make sure to measure the available space under your desk before making a purchase to ensure a proper fit. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Under+Desk+File+Cabinets"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Under-Desk-File-Cabinets-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Under-Desk-File-Cabinets-2" height="540"></a></div>


### Material and Construction

Under desktop file cabinets are typically made from metal, plastic, or a combination of both. Metal cabinets tend to be more durable and offer better security, but can be heavier and may require additional mounting hardware. Plastic cabinets are generally lightweight and easy to move, but may not provide the same level of durability or security as metal ones. Look for cabinets with sturdy hinges and locks to ensure a secure fit and protect your belongings. 


### Wheels or Castors

If you plan to move your under desk file cabinet around frequently, consider purchasing one with wheels or castors. This feature can make it easier to rearrange your workspace or transfer the cabinet between rooms. Look for cabinets with lockable wheels to prevent accidental movement, and be sure to check the weight capacity and durability of the wheels before making a purchase.

### What are under desk file cabinets?

Under desk file cabinets are space-saving storage solutions designed to fit under desks and tables. These cabinets offer easy access to important documents and files while keeping them organized and out of sight. They are an ideal solution for offices, home offices, and other workspaces where space is at a premium. 

Under desk file cabinets come in various sizes and styles to suit different needs. Some models have adjustable height to accommodate different desk types, while others are fixed. These storage solutions typically feature one or more drawers or compartments, and they may be made of materials like wood, composite, or metal. Prices vary based on the size, materials, and additional features. 


### How do under desk file cabinets differ from regular file cabinets?

Under desk file cabinets are distinct from regular file cabinets due to their design and functionality. Regular file cabinets, also known as vertical file cabinets, are larger freestanding storage units with multiple drawers or compartments. They are typically taller and have a fixed height, making them unsuitable for use under desks. 

Under desk file cabinets, on the other hand, are specifically designed to fit under desks and tables. They are usually smaller in size, with fewer drawers, and have a lower profile to maximize available space. This design allows users to access their files and documents more easily without sacrificing storage capacity or organization.
