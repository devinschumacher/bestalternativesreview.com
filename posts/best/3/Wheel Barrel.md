### [Truper 8 Cubic Foot Poly Wheelbarrow](https://serp.ly/amazon/Wheel+Barrel?utm\_term=truper-8-cubic-foot-poly-wheelbarrow)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Wheel+Barrel?utm_term=truper-8-cubic-foot-poly-wheelbarrow"><img alt="truper-33611-8-cu-ft-poly-wheelbarrow-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/truper-33611-8-cu-ft-poly-wheelbarrow-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try out this Truper 33611 wheelbarrow, and I have to say, it's been a game-changer for my lawn and garden projects. The first thing that struck me was its massive 8 cubic foot capacity - perfect for hauling all those heavy loads of dirt, mulch, and leaves. 

The dual heavy-duty steel wheels not only provide stability when moving heavy loads but also make this wheelbarrow lightweight and easy to maneuver. I was impressed by the corrosion-proof poly tray, which promises durability even after years of use. 

However, the poly tray did crack during my first use, which was a bit of a letdown. If I were to recommend this wheelbarrow, I'd suggest investing in a steel tray instead to avoid such issues. Oh, and a minor inconvenience was that the wheelbarrow had no tire when I picked it up, which added to my frustration. 

All in all, the Truper 33611 is a reliable and sturdy option for those looking for a wheelbarrow to handle heavy-duty landscaping jobs. Despite the couple of downsides, I can see myself using this wheelbarrow for many more projects in the future.

First off, the 10 cu-ft. capacity of the bed was a real bonus. It allowed me to transport large amounts of dirt, mulch, and rocks without having to make multiple trips. And with the 800 lb. load capacity, I never felt like I was pushing it to its limits. 

The ability to switch between push and tow operations was another great feature. This cart was perfect for dumping at the back of my truck or tractor, and then pushing it forward when I needed more space at the dump site. The 110° swivel and 52° dump angle made the process even easier, as I could easily dump the contents without spilling or causing a mess. 

That being said, one drawback I did experience was the cart's tendency to turn and go off track when I tried to pull forward to create more space for new content. However, it wasn't a deal-breaker for me, and I was still able to handle the situation with a little finesse. 

Overall, I'm really happy I gave this cart a try. It's durable, versatile, and made a huge difference in my yardwork routine. Highly recommended!

## Buyer's Guide

Welcome to our guide on selecting the perfect wheel barrel! We understand that choosing the right wheel barrel can be a daunting task, especially with the numerous options available on the market. This guide aims to make the process easier by providing you with essential features, considerations, and general advice to help you make an informed decision. 


### Capacity

The capacity of the wheel barrel is the most crucial aspect to consider. It will determine how much material your wheel barrel can carry at a time. Common wheel barrel capacities range from 50 to 120 gallons. Assess your specific needs, such as the volume of materials you want to transport, before making your purchase. Generally, a higher capacity wheel barrel will be more expensive, but it could save you multiple trips if you're working on larger projects.

### Wheel Size

The wheel size of a wheel barrel impacts its maneuverability. Smaller wheels offer greater agility, making it easier to navigate tight spaces. On the other hand, larger wheels provide more stability and can handle heavy loads. Think about where you'll be using the wheel barrel and select a size accordingly. If you'll be working in tight spaces, smaller wheels might be a better choice. For more demanding tasks, larger wheels could be more suitable. 


### Material

Wheel barrels are typically made from plastic, metal, or a combination of both. Metal wheel barrels are stronger and can withstand more wear and tear compared to plastic ones. However, they are also heavier and more expensive. Plastic barrels are generally lighter and more affordable, but they can crack or warp under heavy loads. The material you choose will depend on your budget, the type of material you're transporting, and the amount of wear and tear you expect your wheel barrel to endure.

### Additional Features

Many wheel barrels come with additional features like pneumatic tires, ergonomic handles, or built-in load dumpers that make your work easier. Pneumatic tires can provide a smoother ride, while ergonomic handles can reduce strain on your hands. A built-in load dumper can help distribute weight evenly and prevent back strain. Consider these additional features to find the wheel barrel that best suits your needs.
