<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Rabbit+Cages?utm_term=gutinneen-large-87-8-outdoor-rabbit-hutch"><img alt="gutinneen-rabbit-hutch-chicken-coop-87-8-large-outdoor-bunny-cage-with-removable-pvc-layer-easy-clea-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gutinneen-rabbit-hutch-chicken-coop-87-8-large-outdoor-bunny-cage-with-removable-pvc-layer-easy-clea-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try out the GUTINNEEN Rabbit Hutch Chicken Coop, and let me tell you, it was quite the experience. The first thing that caught my eye was the removable PVC bottom layer, which made cleaning a breeze, especially if you decide to use it indoors. And speaking of cleaning, the deeper pull-out tray was a game-changer, as it prevented any mess from leaking out. 

The coop also comes equipped with higher quality latches that kept my pets safe from any potential predators. The weather-resistant material, complete with an asphalt roof and anti-UV protection, provided enhanced weather protection for my furry friends. 

One of the standout features for me was the large 9.5 ftÂ² safety activity space, which came with four access doors and two ramps. This gave my pets plenty of room to stretch their legs and explore. And of course, the heavy-duty galvanized wire fencing provided a bright and spacious outdoor run area for my chicken, allowing them to roam and enjoy their time. 

Overall, I was incredibly impressed with the GUTINNEEN Rabbit Hutch Chicken Coop. It offered a practical and convenient solution for keeping my pets safe, clean, and comfortable. I'm confident that any pet owner looking for a high-quality shelter would be pleased with this coop. 


### [Niamvelo Wooden Rabbit Hutch for Small Animals](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Rabbit+Cages?utm\_term=niamvelo-wooden-rabbit-hutch-for-small-animals)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Rabbit+Cages?utm_term=niamvelo-wooden-rabbit-hutch-for-small-animals"><img alt="niamvelo-wood-rabbit-hutch-indooroutdoor-bunny-cage-with-wheels-waterproof-roof-for-small-animals-gr-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/niamvelo-wood-rabbit-hutch-indooroutdoor-bunny-cage-with-wheels-waterproof-roof-for-small-animals-gr-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Niamvelo Wood Rabbit Hutch, and my experience was quite mixed. On the plus side, I appreciated the extra run cages which gave my furry friends ample space to explore and move around. The style of the cage is also a nice touch - it looks great in my backyard garden and adds a unique charm to the area. 

However, there were a few drawbacks that left me disappointed. Firstly, there were no pre-drilled holes for assembly, so I had to mark and drill myself - a frustrating process. The box I received also had a rough and damaged appearance, which wasn't very reassuring. 

In terms of quality, I found the wood to be quite flimsy and not very rigid. This was evident when it came to putting the cage together, and made me concerned about its durability in the long run. I also noticed that the holes in the roof did not align properly, creating a bit of a hassle to figure out how to secure them properly. 

Overall, I'd say the Niamvelo Wood Rabbit Hutch has its pros and cons. It has a nice look and provides plenty of space for pets, but the assembly process can be tricky and the cage itself feels somewhat cheaply made.

## Buyer's Guide

Selecting the right rabbit cage is crucial for the well-being of your furry companion. In this buyer's guide, we will discuss essential features, considerations, and advice to help you make an informed decision when choosing a rabbit cage. Remember, rabbits are social animals and should not be kept alone, so it's essential to provide them with adequate space and proper living conditions. 


### Material

The material of the rabbit cage plays a significant role in its durability, safety, and ease of cleaning. Most rabbit cages are made of materials like wood, wire, or plastic. Wooden cages provide warmth and a natural feel for rabbits, but they can be more challenging to clean, and some cheaper options may splinter. Wire cages are less expensive and lightweight, but rabbits can chew the wires, which poses a risk to their health. Plastic cages are cost-effective, easy to clean, and lightweight, but some rabbits might chew the plastic, which may expose them to hazardous chemicals. Consider your rabbit's habits and preferences before selecting the cage material.

### Size

Rabbits need ample space to thrive and should be provided with a cage that accommodates their size and activity level. As a general rule, the minimum cage size for a rabbit should be about 2 square feet per pound of the rabbit's body weight, and the height should be at least 10 inches to prevent the rabbit from jumping out. For multiple rabbits, the cage should have at least 5 square feet of space per rabbit and plenty of hiding spots for each rabbit to reduce stress. Make sure to measure the dimensions carefully to ensure the cage meets your rabbit's needs. 


### Litter Box and Bedding

A rabbit cage should have a designated litter box area and comfortable bedding for your pet. The litter box can be made from a tray or a cat litter box covered with absorbent bedding materials like hay, wood shavings, or aspen. Cleaning the litter box regularly is crucial to keep your rabbit healthy and happy. The bedding should be changed frequently as well to maintain hygiene and prevent the buildup of odors.

### Ease of Cleaning

Regular cleaning is essential for maintaining a healthy environment for your rabbit. Therefore, the rabbit cage should be easy to clean and disinfect. Look for cages that have removable parts and smooth surfaces that are easy to wipe down. Additionally, the cage should have a water bottle and food dish that are also easy to clean and maintain.

### What Size Rabbit Cage do I Need?

Determining the correct size for a rabbit cage is essential for ensuring your pet's happiness and health. A minimum size of 24x18x24 inches (61x45x61 cm) should be considered, but larger cages are always preferable. A guideline to follow is providing 10-12 square feet (1-1.5 square meters) of floor space per rabbit. If possible, include additional space for exercise and socialization. Consider your rabbit's breed since some can grow larger than others, and allocate adequate room for food dishes, water bottles, and hiding spots like tunnels and hutches for a comfortable living environment.


### What Materials are Safe for the Rabbit Cage?

For a safe and durable rabbit cage, choose wire cages made from non-toxic materials such as powder-coated steel, aluminum, or galvanized steel. Wooden cages are also an option but must be untreated and non-toxic. Avoid using cedar or pine wood as they can be harmful to rabbits. Always check for sharp edges or protruding nails that pose a risk to your pet. Provide a cozy environment by adding a bedding material like hay, straw, or fleece for rabbits to burrow in and stay warm, or use paper pellets for a waterproof, easy-to-clean substrate, especially for male rabbits with urine-marking habits.

### How Often Should I Clean the Rabbit Cage?

Cleaning the rabbit cage is crucial for maintaining a healthy environment for your pet. It should be done at least once a day, including spot cleaning as needed. This helps prevent the buildup of odors and bacteria. Ensure the entire cage is cleaned, including bedding materials, food and water dishes, and the outside of the cage. A deep clean every few weeks involves removing all bedding materials and cleaning the cage thoroughly with a pet-safe disinfectant. Follow the instructions for the disinfectant and reintroduce new bedding materials once it has dried.


### Can I Use a Hutch or a Cage for My Rabbit?

Both hutches and cages can provide suitable habitats for rabbits, depending on your pet's specific needs and preferences, as well as the caretaker's. Hutches are larger and more suitable for outdoor use, while cages are designed for indoor use and can be more compact. Factors to consider include the rabbit's size, the climate in your area, and the level of socialization and interaction desired. Ensure that the structure is sturdy and provides enough space for your pet to move around, play, eat, and use the restroom, regardless of whether you choose a hutch or a cage.

### Should I Provide My Rabbit with a Litter Box or a Potty Pad?

Rabbits can be trained to use litter boxes or potty pads with the right approach and patience. Training can have numerous benefits, such as keeping your living area cleaner, making it easier to monitor your rabbit's health, and encouraging positive behaviors. To train your rabbit, place the desired litter box or potty pad in their cage and encourage them to use it by adding their waste in the designated area. Consistency is key â place it consistently and reduce your own cleaning as your rabbit becomes more familiar with the area. Offer treats or praise as positive reinforcement when used correctly.


### What Accessories Can I Add to My Rabbit Cage?

Adding accessories to your rabbit cage not only enhances your pet's living space but also offers entertainment, exercise, and mental stimulation. Popular options include tunnels and hideaways for security and privacy, chew toys to help wear down their teeth and combat boredom, and hammocks or platforms for resting and play. Always ensure the accessories are safe and appropriate for the rabbit's size and age. Monitor interactions and remove damaged or worn items. Regular cleaning and maintenance are essential to promote a healthy and hygienic environment for your pet.
