### How do I store Pink Guavas?

When it comes to storing Pink Guavas, it's essential to keep them in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. If you've purchased Pink Guavas that are still partially green, allow them to ripen at room temperature for 1-2 days before transferring them to the refrigerator to prevent over-ripening. 

Once the Pink Guava is ripe, store it in a refrigerator to prolong its shelf life. Depending on the temperature settings, the fruit should remain fresh for 2-3 days. If you need to store the fruit for a longer period, you can wrap it individually in plastic wrap, place it in an airtight container, or freeze it. Frozen Pink Guava can be used in smoothies or added to other recipes as a convenient ingredient. 


### Do Pink Guavas taste similar to regular Guavas?

While Pink Guava and regular Guava have similarities in their flavor and texture, they have distinct taste profiles. Pink Guavas are characterized by their sweet, soft flesh, while regular Guavas have a more tart, slightly grainy texture. Both fruits are a delicious and healthy option, and their taste profiles can complement each other in various recipes. 

If you're unsure which guava variety to try, consider choosing Pink Guavas if you prefer a sweet, creamy texture. Conversely, opt for regular Guavas if you enjoy a tangier, slightly crispier fruit. Ultimately, both Pink and regular Guava can be enjoyed on their own or incorporated into a wide range of dishes to satisfy any fruit craving.
