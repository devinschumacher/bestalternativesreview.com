### [Smeg Orange Combined No Frost Fridge](https://serp.ly/amazon/Smeg+Refrigerator?utm\_term=smeg-orange-combined-no-frost-fridge)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Smeg+Refrigerator?utm_term=smeg-orange-combined-no-frost-fridge"><img alt="smeg-frigor-fico-combi-no-frost-fab32ror5-naranja-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/smeg-frigor-fico-combi-no-frost-fab32ror5-naranja-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the pleasure of trying out the Smeg FAB32 Fridge in my kitchen. This retro-styled appliance has quickly become the centerpiece of my kitchen, thanks to its sleek design and classic '50s vibe. The fridge's dimensions make it a perfect fit for my kitchen, and its stainless steel and plastic construction give it a durable and elegant look. 

One of the standout features of this fridge is its Digital LED display, which is easy to read and provides accurate information about the fridge's temperature and other functions. The LED lighting inside the fridge is another great feature that adds a touch of elegance and brightness to my kitchen. And speaking of lighting, the LifePlus 0°C drawer is an excellent addition that keeps my food fresher for longer. 

While I absolutely love the style and design of this fridge, I did encounter one issue after several years of use. The fridge began beeping as if a door was open, even though it wasn't. After an investigation, it turned out that the temperature in the freezer compartment was rapidly climbing back up to zero, which was a cause for concern given the amount of food we had stored in there. An engineer was eventually dispatched, but the problem was determined to be unfixable, and my warranty had already expired. It was a disappointing end to my experience with this otherwise great fridge. 

Overall, I'd say that the Smeg FAB32 Fridge is a stylish and functional appliance that would be a great addition to any kitchen. Just beware of any potential issues that may arise after several years of use, as they can be difficult to fix or replace under warranty. 


### [Smeg Retro Top Freezer Refrigerator with Brass Handles](https://serp.ly/amazon/Smeg+Refrigerator?utm\_term=smeg-retro-top-freezer-refrigerator-with-brass-handles)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Smeg+Refrigerator?utm_term=smeg-retro-top-freezer-refrigerator-with-brass-handles"><img alt="smeg-refrigerator-cream-fab50urcrb3-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/smeg-refrigerator-cream-fab50urcrb3-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Last week, I finally got my hands on a Smeg Refrigerator in the cream fabric finish. It's been such a game-changer in my daily life - all the modern conveniences I need, wrapped in a vintage aesthetic that's simply delightful. 

What stood out to me the most was its total no-frost design; my food stays fresh and crisp without having to worry about freezer burn! The dual-flow cooling system is another standout feature - it maintains a consistent temperature throughout the fridge, keeping my groceries at their best. 

I also appreciate the automatic ice maker. It's so convenient to have ice ready whenever I need it - no more ice cube trays to fill and refill. Plus, the retro-style brass handles add a touch of timeless charm to my kitchen. 

However, there were a couple of downsides. First, the height was slightly taller than my previous refrigerator, which made it a bit trickier to reach the top shelves. My second issue was with the width, which was a bit narrower than I expected - I had to squeeze my groceries in rather tightly. 

Overall, this Smeg Refrigerator has been a great addition to my kitchen. Its blend of modern convenience and vintage charm is a refreshing change, and I can't imagine going back to a regular refrigerator now.

What really sets this fridge apart is the ample storage capacity - 9 cubic feet for fresh food and an additional 0.92 cubic feet for my frozen goods. The internal freezer compartment, with its manual defrost feature, is quite roomy too. It easily fits boxes of frozen waffles, ice cream sandwiches, and mochis, with plenty of space left over. 

The life plus zone is a convenient feature, keeping items at the perfect temperature without affecting the overall operation of the fridge. The LED lighting inside adds a touch of elegance, making it easy to spot your favorite dairy when reaching for your drink in the wee hours. 

Automatic defrost and separate fruit and veg drawer are other thoughtful additions by Smeg. However, the bottle shelf is a bit too narrow for standard-sized water bottles, which can feel cramped. Nevertheless, overall, this charming retro-style fridge has become a beloved part of my daily life. It perfectly blends form and function, all while looking fabulous in my kitchen.

Just recently, I made the decision to switch up my conventional fridge for something a bit more playful - the Smeg x Veuve Clicquot Fab28 Retro-Style Refrigerator. I must admit, its vibrant, bold color instantly caught my attention, and as someone who loves a pop of color in their kitchen, it fit the bill perfectly. 

One of the biggest benefits I've noticed during my time with this fridge is the ample storage space it provides. With its adjustable shelves, racks, and bins, I’ve been able to organize my groceries in a way that makes the most of the available space. The convenient icebox is a nice touch, keeping my drinks cool and refreshing. 

However, one slight con I've come across is the LED interior light. While it does a great job of lighting up the fridge's cool interior, it has a tendency to make the colors of my food stand out a bit too much, making certain items appear spoiled even if they’re not. 

All in all, the Smeg x Veuve Clicquot Fab28 Retro-Style Refrigerator brings a vibrant pop of color and modern innovation to the retro-inspired kitchen. It's a stylish addition to my kitchen while providing plenty of storage space for my groceries.
