### [Smith Outcome Matte Black Women's Polarized Sunglasses](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Smith+Sunglasses+Women?utm\_term=smith-outcome-matte-black-womens-polarized-sunglasses)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Smith+Sunglasses+Women?utm_term=smith-outcome-matte-black-womens-polarized-sunglasses"><img alt="smith-outcome-sunglasses-matte-black-polarized-gray-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/smith-outcome-sunglasses-matte-black-polarized-gray-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try out the Smith Outcome sunglasses, and I have to say, I was pretty impressed. These shades not only look great, but they also pack a punch when it comes to performance. 

One thing that really stands out is the ChromaPop lenses, which are designed to cut glare and enhance color and contrast. I found this feature to be incredibly useful when I was out and about on sunny days. The Carbonic lenses also offer some impressive features, such as impact resistance and clear optics. Overall, I found that the lenses on these sunglasses provided excellent protection and vision clarity. 

The fit of the Smith Outcome sunglasses was also a highlight for me. The medium-large fit and medium coverage meant that they were comfortable to wear, and the 6-base lens curvature was just right for everyday wear. I also appreciated the silicone nose pads, which provided a secure and comfortable fit, and the spring hinges, which self-adjusted to my face, creating a snug and comfy fit. 

Now, let's talk about the frame. The metal frame and acetate temple tips gave these sunglasses a sturdy and stylish look. However, I did notice that they let some light in through the sides, which wasn't ideal, and I would have appreciated an anti-reflective coating on the inside. 

Overall, the Smith Outcome sunglasses were a great addition to my daily routine. They provided excellent protection, performance, and comfort, and I only encountered a few minor downsides. It's definitely worth considering these shades if you're in the market for a new pair of sunglasses.

I recently tried out the Smith Guide's Choice bifocal sunglasses in a classic Havana color, and they exceeded my expectations. As a fly fisher, I often need glasses that can offer both near and far focus as I tie flies, and these sunglasses filled the bill perfectly. Their polarization helps reduce glare and improves overall clarity, making it easier for me to spot fish in the water. 

The Megol nose pads ensure a secure and comfortable fit in any conditions, while the Evolve eco frames are both lightweight and environmentally friendly. The detachable leash added an extra layer of convenience and made it easy for me to keep them close when I was on the fly. The only minor drawback I experienced was that the anti-fingerprint coating seemed to wear off faster than I'd have preferred. 

Overall, the Smith Guide's Choice bifocal sunglasses impressed me with their combination of performance, practicality, and style. They're a great addition to any angler's gear, and I'd definitely recommend giving them a try.
