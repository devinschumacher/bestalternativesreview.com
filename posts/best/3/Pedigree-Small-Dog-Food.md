### [Pedigree Puppy Growth & Protection Chicken & Veggie Dog Food for Small Dogs](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Pedigree+Small+Dog+Food?utm\_term=pedigree-puppy-growth-protection-chicken-veggie-dog-food-for-small-dogs)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Pedigree+Small+Dog+Food?utm_term=pedigree-puppy-growth-protection-chicken-veggie-dog-food-for-small-dogs"><img alt="pedigree-puppy-growth-protection-chicken-vegetable-flavor-dry-dog-food-3-5-lb-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/pedigree-puppy-growth-protection-chicken-vegetable-flavor-dry-dog-food-3-5-lb-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried Pedigree Puppy Growth & Protection Chicken & Vegetable Flavor Dry Dog Food, and I must say, it's a pretty good choice for my puppy. The kibble size is perfect for her to chew and swallow easily, and I appreciate that it's made with no high fructose corn syrup, artificial flavors, or added sugar. 

I was a bit skeptical at first when I noticed the kibble contained food coloring, but my puppy seemed to love the taste nonetheless. She devoured it during her meals and even asked for some as a snack. I felt a sense of relief knowing I was giving her a complete and balanced meal, as the food is packed with key nutrients similar to her mother's milk. 

Furthermore, the formula is specifically designed for puppy growth and development, with DHA to support her brain and calcium and phosphorus for strong teeth and bones. However, I did notice that the food contains chicken byproduct meal as one of its first ingredients. While this isn't a deal-breaker, it's worth mentioning that some puppy foods have higher-quality proteins in their recipes. 

Overall, I'm happy with my experience using Pedigree Puppy Growth & Protection Dry Dog Food. It's convenient, reasonably priced, and seems to align with my puppy's taste preferences and nutritional needs. I would recommend it to other dog owners looking for a well-rounded food option for their growing pups.

The combination of its big kibbles, complete and balanced nutrition, and lack of artificial additives make it a solid contender for any dog owner looking to feed their furry friend well.

## Buyer's Guide

Welcome to our Buyer's Guide for Pedigree Small Dog Food. In this section, we will discuss important features, considerations, and general advice to help you make an informed decision when purchasing food for your small dog. 


### Nutritional Needs of Small Dogs

Small dog breeds have specific nutritional needs that are different from those of larger breeds. They require a diet that provides the necessary nutrients, vitamins, and minerals to support their overall health and growth. Look for dog food specifically formulated for small dogs to ensure they receive the proper nutrition. 


### Protein Quality and Quantity

Protein is essential for your small dog's growth and overall health. Look for dog food that contains high-quality protein sources, such as chicken, fish, or lamb. The protein content should be within the recommended range for small dogs, typically between 25-30% of their daily caloric intake. Make sure the protein source is listed at the top of the ingredient list. 


### Healthy Fats and Omega-3s

Healthy fats and Omega-3 fatty acids are crucial for your small dog's skin, coat, and overall health. Look for dog food that contains sources of healthy fats, like fish oil or flaxseed, and has Omega-3 fatty acids from sources like salmon or cod liver oil. These will help keep your small dog's skin and coat healthy and shiny. 


### Carbohydrates and Fiber Content

Carbohydrates and fiber provide energy and support digestion in small dogs. Choose a dog food with digestible carbohydrate sources, like whole grains, rice, or potatoes.
