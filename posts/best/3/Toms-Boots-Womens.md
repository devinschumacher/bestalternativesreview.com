### [Classic Kallie Stacked T-strap Boot by Toms](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Toms+Boots+Womens?utm\_term=classic-kallie-stacked-t-strap-boot-by-toms)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Toms+Boots+Womens?utm_term=classic-kallie-stacked-t-strap-boot-by-toms"><img alt="toms-womens-kallie-boot-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/toms-womens-kallie-boot-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Kallie boots by Toms are a unique fusion of style and comfort for women. The first time I tried them, I found the fit to be tight, especially if you have wide feet. However, after a few days of wear, they stretched ever so slightly, making them much more comfortable. The rubber sole and suede upper provide a breathable experience for the feet, while the wedge heel offers additional support and comfort. 

One of my favorite features is the deep cutouts at the sides, which add an unexpected touch of sophistication to the otherwise casual boot. The orthotic insole made with 32% eco content provides additional cushioning, which is great for those who suffer from arch pain or plantar fasciitis. The 2.75-inch stacked wedge heel and stacked leather midsole also contribute to the shoe's overall comfort. 

However, one downside is the durability of the sole. After just a few months of use, the heel started peeling off on one shoe, leaving me disappointed with the overall build quality. Additionally, the shoes seem to run small and are not as true to size as one might expect. In conclusion, the Kallie boots by Toms are an excellent choice if you're looking for a stylish, comfortable, and eco-friendly boot, but be prepared for occasional issues with sizing and durability. 


### [Comfortable Toms Colette Women's Wedge Ankle Boot](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Toms+Boots+Womens?utm\_term=comfortable-toms-colette-womens-wedge-ankle-boot)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Toms+Boots+Womens?utm_term=comfortable-toms-colette-womens-wedge-ankle-boot"><img alt="toms-collette-womens-wedge-ankle-boots-size-9-natural-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/toms-collette-womens-wedge-ankle-boots-size-9-natural-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Tom's Everly Chelsea-Inspired Women's Olive Bootie](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Toms+Boots+Womens?utm\_term=toms-everly-chelsea-inspired-womens-olive-bootie)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Toms+Boots+Womens?utm_term=toms-everly-chelsea-inspired-womens-olive-bootie"><img alt="toms-everly-boot-8-womens-olive-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/toms-everly-boot-8-womens-olive-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a fan of Toms shoes, I was excited to try out their Everly Boot in an olive color. I was really impressed with the Chelsea-inspired design, suede and leather uppers, and stacked leather wrapped heel. The high-rebound comfort insoles and non-removable OrthoLite Eco X40 Hybrid insoles were a nice touch, too. 

What stood out the most was how easy it was to slip the boot on and off with the dual gore. The stylish design was versatile and took me from day to night effortlessly. 

However, I did notice that this shoe ran a bit narrow, which might be a downside for some customers who have a wider fit. As a person with narrow feet, I didn't find it to be too much of an issue, but it's something to keep in mind when ordering. 

Overall, I'd say the Toms Everly Boot is a comfortable, stylish, and practical addition to any wardrobe. If you're looking for a reliable and comfortable pair of boots, this one should definitely be on your list.

### [Water-Resistant TOMS Dakota Tarmac Boot for Women](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Toms+Boots+Womens?utm\_term=water-resistant-toms-dakota-tarmac-boot-for-women)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Toms+Boots+Womens?utm_term=water-resistant-toms-dakota-tarmac-boot-for-women"><img alt="toms-womens-dakota-tarmac-olive-6-6" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/toms-womens-dakota-tarmac-olive-6-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Grey Maddie Nubuck Suede Women's Toms Boots](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Toms+Boots+Womens?utm\_term=grey-maddie-nubuck-suede-womens-toms-boots)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Toms+Boots+Womens?utm_term=grey-maddie-nubuck-suede-womens-toms-boots"><img alt="toms-womens-grey-maddie-nubuck-suede-boots-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/toms-womens-grey-maddie-nubuck-suede-boots-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Recently, I had the opportunity to try out a pair of Toms Women's Grey Maddie Nubuck Suede Boots. The moment I slipped them on, I fell in love with their style - the perfect balance of chic and comfort. The 2.75-inch heel added a touch of elegance to my outfit, while the faux suede upper made me feel like I was wearing a cozy pair of slippers. 

[One of the standout features of these boots was their versatility.](https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativesreview.com/blob/main/posts/best/3/Studded-Combat-Boots.md) I could dress them up for a night out or dress them down for a casual day at the office. The rubber sole also added a layer of comfort, as I walked around town, and provided a good grip on different surfaces. 

However, there were a couple of things that I found less than ideal. The toe area felt a bit narrow for my taste, which made the boots feel a bit snug. I had to go up half a size to find the perfect fit. Although the rubber sole was comfortable, I wouldn't recommend wearing these boots on icy days, as they don't have the same traction as real rubber soles. 

Overall, I found these Toms Women's Grey Maddie Nubuck Suede Boots to be a great addition to my wardrobe. They were stylish, versatile, and comfortable, but I did wish they were a bit wider in the toe area and had real rubber soles for added safety on icy days. Despite these small drawbacks, I would still recommend these boots to anyone looking for a stylish yet comfortable pair of boots for their daily life. 


### [Tom's Mesa Waterproof Leather Nylon Hiking Boots for Women](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Toms+Boots+Womens?utm\_term=toms-mesa-waterproof-leather-nylon-hiking-boots-for-women)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Toms+Boots+Womens?utm_term=toms-mesa-waterproof-leather-nylon-hiking-boots-for-women"><img alt="toms-womens-mesa-waterproof-black-leather-nylon-boots-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/toms-womens-mesa-waterproof-black-leather-nylon-boots-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

A couple of weeks ago, I was gifted a pair of Toms Women's Mesa waterproof black leather nylon boots. As a lover of practical yet stylish footwear, I couldn't wait to put them to the test. 

From the very first wear, I noticed the waterproof leather nubuck upper. The boots felt strong and reassuring on my feet, perfect for the unpredictable weather we endure. The seam seal WP construction did its job and kept my feet dry even in the rain. The lace-up closure provided a snug and comfortable fit. 

However, there were a few areas that could use improvement. Although the canvas lining felt comfortable initially, it started to fray after a while and made me question the longevity of the boots. Additionally, the rubber/EVA Mix outsole would occasionally catch on uneven surfaces, causing me to stumble. 

In summary, the Toms Women's Mesa waterproof black leather nylon boots were both comfortable and functional during my daily walks. Just be aware that while the upper is waterproof, the interior may not hold up as well over time.

### [Toms Mojave Waterproof Women's Boots - Brown: Durable and Comfortable](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Toms+Boots+Womens?utm\_term=toms-mojave-waterproof-womens-boots-brown-durable-and-comfortable)

I recently tried TOMS Mojave Waterproof Womens Boots in Brown, and let me tell you, they were a game-changer for my daily life during the cold season. The leather upper, a key highlight, provided a sleek and polished look that I absolutely loved. Not only that, but the lace-up closure was a secure fit that kept me comfortable all day long. 

One thing that caught my attention was the EVA fit and chamois midsole. It offered exceptional comfort, and I felt like I was walking on clouds. But one thing that I noticed didn't sit as well with me was the sawtooth rubber outsole, which, while perfect for enhancing traction, proved to be quite slippery at times. 

Despite the minor issue, the boots proved to be durable and long-lasting, a feature that made them well worth the investment. The rust-proof metal D rings and the built-in OrthoLite Eco X4 Hybrid insole were the finishing touches that made these boots stand out. Their unique blend of style and functionality made them an excellent addition to my winter wardrobe, and I highly recommend them to anyone who's in the market for a pair of waterproof boots.
