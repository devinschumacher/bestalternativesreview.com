I recently had the opportunity to try out the Ingenico iWL281 Thermal Paper Rolls from TerminalDepot, and I must say, I was impressed. As someone who relies heavily on my terminal for daily business transactions, I needed a reliable thermal paper that wouldn't compromise my device's performance. These paper rolls fit the bill perfectly. 

The paper rolls come in a box of 20 and are specifically designed for use with Ingenico terminals, ensuring optimal performance and crisp, clear, black images. I particularly appreciated the 1/2" core size and 2 1/4" x 50' paper size, which perfectly aligned with my terminal's specifications. 

One of my favorite features of these paper rolls is the BPA-free paper, which guarantees safety and reliability for my device and my customers. The paper also has a distinctive red, end-of-roll indicator, making it easy to replace rolls when needed. 

While these paper rolls have served me well in my daily business transactions, I did notice that they are slightly more expensive than some alternative options on the market. However, the peace of mind and superior performance provided by TerminalDepot's paper rolls make the investment worth it. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the Ingenico iWL281 Thermal Paper Rolls from TerminalDepot to anyone in need of high-quality, BPA-free paper rolls for their business terminal. These paper rolls deliver on performance, reliability, and safety, making them a smart choice for any business owner. 


### [Gorilla Supply 50 Rolls Thermal Receipt Paper for Ingenico iCT220 & Verifone Vx520](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Receipt+Paper?utm\_term=gorilla-supply-50-rolls-thermal-receipt-paper-for-ingenico-ict220-verifone-vx520)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Receipt+Paper?utm_term=gorilla-supply-50-rolls-thermal-receipt-paper-for-ingenico-ict220-verifone-vx520"><img alt="gorilla-supply-50-thermal-paper-rolls-2-1-4-x-50-verifone-vx520-ingenico-ict220-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gorilla-supply-50-thermal-paper-rolls-2-1-4-x-50-verifone-vx520-ingenico-ict220-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently received a few rolls of Gorilla Supply's 50 Thermal Paper Rolls from eBay. It surprised me when I first opened the package, as I was not expecting the rolls to be so tight. I ended up cutting off the end of the roll with a box cutter before I could get it to tear. 

Once I got it started, the paper fed easily into my Verifone Vx520. The crisp, clear images printed beautifully on the receipt, and I appreciated the warning signal on the end of each roll. My only complaint is the tape is too sticky; it made it difficult to wind up the next sheet of paper without losing a layer or two of adhesive. 

Overall, I'm very pleased with the product and the price. The rolls have a longer lifespan than anticipated, and I've been able to print numerous receipts without any issues. If you're looking for thermal paper for your credit card terminal, these Gorilla Supply rolls are a great option at a reasonable price.

## Buyer's Guide

Receipt paper is an essential component for businesses, enabling them to print out purchase or sales slips, invoices, and other financial records. Choosing the right receipt paper can help you achieve a professional appearance, enhance customer experience, and ensure the longevity of your records. This buyer's guide explains the important features, considerations, and advice for selecting the right receipt paper for your business. 


### Paper Type

Receipt paper comes in various types, each with unique advantages and uses. The main types are thermal, direct thermal, and impact. Thermal paper is the most common type and uses heat from a printer to produce the image. Direct thermal paper does not require heat, and the ink is printed directly onto the paper. Impact receipt paper, on the other hand, uses an impact printer to create perforations on the paper, making it suitable for producing slips with multiple lines. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Receipt+Paper"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Receipt-Paper-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Receipt-Paper-2" height="540"></a></div>


### Paper Size

Choose a paper size that fits your receipt printer. The most common sizes for receipt paper are 80 and 85mm. Compare the size of your printer to the paper size to ensure compatibility. Additionally, consider the size of your transaction slips to avoid overflow or underutilization of the paper. Consider whether your business frequently issues multi-line receipts requiring larger paper sizes. 


### Tear-Apart Features

A tear-apart feature can help your customers separate the receipt stub from the main section easily. This is particularly useful in situations where only a portion of the receipt is needed, such as for credit card transactions. Consider a paper type that provides an efficient tear-apart feature to enhance the customer experience. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Receipt+Paper"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Receipt-Paper-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Receipt-Paper-3" height="540"></a></div>


### Paper Quality and Durability

The quality and durability of receipt paper are essential for long-lasting records. Look for papers with high ink density and sharp, well-defined text. Additionally, choose a paper with at least 50% cotton content for better durability and resistance to fading, smudgers, and smudges. A reinforced paper edge can also help prevent tearing and ensure smoother processing. 


## FAQ

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Receipt+Paper"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Receipt-Paper-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Receipt-Paper-4" height="540"></a></div>


### What are the different types of receipt paper available?

There are several types of receipt paper available in the market, including paper receipts, thermal receipts, and digital receipts. Paper receipts are the most common and are suitable for low-volume sales and basic transactions. Thermal receipts are used in combination with thermal printers and have a permanent print that is resistant to smudging, fading, and moisture. Digital receipts are electronic and can be sent via email, SMS, or even printed directly from the vendor's website. 

When selecting the type of receipt paper, consider factors like the length of your receipts, the frequency of use, and the amount of information you need to include. For basic transactions or infrequent use, paper receipts are usually the most cost-effective option. For faster and more efficient transactions, thermal receipts are a great choice. 


### Can I print receipts on regular paper?

While it is possible to print receipts on standard printer paper, these receipts may not be as durable or professional-looking as those printed on specialized receipt paper. Regular printer paper can easily smudge, tear, or fade when exposed to moisture or sunlight. This can be problematic for customers and may reflect poorly on your business. 

Receipt paper is specifically designed to withstand wear and tear, providing a crisp, clean print that remains readable even after the receipt has been handled multiple times. Using receipt paper can also help you present your brand in a more professional light, making it a smart investment for businesses of all sizes. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Receipt+Paper"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Receipt-Paper-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Receipt-Paper-5" height="540"></a></div>


### What are the benefits of using thermal receipt paper?

Thermal receipt paper offers several advantages over traditional paper receipts. These include durability, resistance to smudging and fading, and higher print quality. Thermal receipts are made using a special coating that reacts to heat, which makes the ink more vibrant and less prone to smudging or fading. This means that your receipt will maintain its quality for longer and will be easier for customers to read and store. 

Another benefit of thermal receipts is their ability to be printed quickly, which can help reduce wait times for customers. This can be especially important during peak business hours or in high-traffic areas. Thermal receipts are also more likely to remain intact after handling, reducing the likelihood of damage or loss. 


### What should I consider when choosing a receipt paper supplier?

When selecting a receipt paper supplier, there are several factors to consider, including price, quality, and availability. Start by setting a budget for your receipt paper and researching suppliers who can meet your needs while staying within your price range. Compare prices, delivery times, and customer reviews to help you make an informed decision. 

It is also important to consider the environmental impact of the receipt paper you choose. Look for suppliers who offer eco-friendly options, such as recycled or FSC-certified paper. Additionally, consider the durability and print quality of the receipt paper, as these factors can affect customer satisfaction and your business's reputation. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Receipt+Paper"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Receipt-Paper-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Receipt-Paper-6" height="540"></a></div>


### How can I ensure that my receipts are properly printed?

To ensure that your receipts are printed correctly, make sure you are using high-quality receipt paper designed for your specific printer model. Check the paper settings, such as temperature and pressure, to ensure that they are within the recommended range for your receipt paper supplier. Additionally, update your printer software regularly to take advantage of the latest features and improvements. 

If you are experiencing issues with your printed receipts, consider investing in a receipt printer that offers additional features, such as advanced paper handling or customizable settings. These features can help you optimize your receipt printing process and ensure that your receipts are professional-looking and easy to read. 


### Is thermal receipt paper safe to use?

Thermal receipt paper is considered safe for use, as it does not contain any toxic chemicals or release any harmful fumes during the printing process. The ink on thermal receipts is typically made from a non-toxic, water-based solution that is safe for both humans and the environment. In addition, thermal receipt paper undergoes rigorous testing and certification to ensure that it meets the highest safety standards. 

However, it is always a good idea to follow proper handling and disposal procedures when using thermal receipts.
