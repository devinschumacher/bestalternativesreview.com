### [Strawberry Protein Pudding & Shake: Proti-Thin Delight](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Protein+Pudding?utm\_term=strawberry-protein-pudding-shake-proti-thin-delight)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Protein+Pudding?utm_term=strawberry-protein-pudding-shake-proti-thin-delight"><img alt="delicious-strawberry-shake-pudding-proti-thin-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/delicious-strawberry-shake-pudding-proti-thin-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently started using the Proti-Thin Delicious Strawberry Shake & Pudding mix. I was drawn to it by the thought of a healthier, lower calorie dessert or snack. It didn't disappoint me at all. 

One of the first things that stood out about this product was how easily it transformed into a thick, decadent pudding or a refreshing, smooth shake. It took less than a minute to achieve either consistency, which I found quite impressive. Whether I was eating it in the morning as a breakfast option or snacking on it in the evening, it filled me up and kept me satisfied throughout the day. 

But the thing that truly sold me on this product was the taste. The strawberry flavor was sweet and refreshing, with the added touch of being all natural. Even without the added fresh fruit, which I occasionally mixed in, the flavor didn't feel artificial or too sweet. It's a great change from other protein shakes I've used in the past that left a strange aftertaste. 

The nutritious aspect of this product also caught my attention. It's packed with over 20 vitamins and minerals, making it a great addition to my daily routine. It's suitable for liquid and pureed diets, as well as weight loss and maintenance diets. Plus, since it's aspartame-free and suitable for various bariatric patients, it's a great choice for those looking to meet specific dietary needs. 

The only downside I found was that the packaging could be a bit misleading. On the packaging, it seems to indicate that it's an all-purpose product and could be easily incorporated into daily meals, but the label clearly specifies it's meant as a supplement. It's an easy oversight but something worth considering before use. 

Overall, I'm very pleased with my experience using the Proti-Thin Delicious Strawberry Shake & Pudding mix. The convenience, taste, and nutritional value make it a product I would consider re-purchasing in the future.

The preparation process is incredibly easy - simply add water, mix, and you're good to go! In fact, it was so easy I ended up making it more often than I initially intended. 

The texture of the Chocolate Peanut Butter Protein Pudding or Shake really surprised me. It was thick and creamy, just like a conventional pudding or shake, but with the added benefit of being healthier. The protein content is an impressive 15 grams, which is a great bonus for those looking to build muscle or maintain a strict diet. 

Though the taste of the chocolate and peanut butter was quite delicious, I found the serving size to be a little on the small side. However, the high-protein content made me feel quite satisfied after consuming a serving. The only negative aspect I encountered was that the instructions suggested adding an additional 10 ounces of water for a shake, which made it too runny for my liking. 

Overall, the Chocolate Peanut Butter Protein Pudding or Shake Mix from BariatricPal is a fantastic choice for anyone looking for a delicious, healthier alternative to traditional puddings and shakes.
