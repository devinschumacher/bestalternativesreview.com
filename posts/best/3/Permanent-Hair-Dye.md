Giving you an experience as close as possible to a salon visit, the L'Oreal Feria Permanent Haircolor Gel offers a fantastic combination of intense, long-lasting shades and gentle care for your hair. With its commitment to delivering shimmering results inspired by the latest in fashion, this hair dye kit will help you transform your look with its unique color spectrum and highly customizable blend of shampoos, conditioners, and conditioners. 

One of the main attractions of this hair dye is the 3x highlights technology, producing vibrant and shiny color with maximum intensity. Custom-blended by L'Oreal master colorists, Feria delivers head-turning shades without the need for a salon appointment, all while maintaining the health and comfort of your hair.

When applying, make sure to be mindful of the timing, as leaving the product in too long can result in hair damage. 

But, this hair dye's long-lasting and brilliant results do come with a slight catch: its scent. A minor downside for some users, but the unique smell contributes to the overall salon-like experience. And after using the product, you may discover some residue lingering in your hair, though it is easily washed out with the accompanying shampoo and conditioner. 

Overall, the L'Oreal Feria Permanent Haircolor Gel is an excellent choice for those looking for a bold, customizable hair color with a salon-quality feel. Combining powerful shades, gentle care, and easy application, this hair dye kit offers a seamless and long-lasting hair coloring experience, minus the hefty price tag.

### [Garnier Nutrisse Ultra Color Nourishing Intense Burgundy Hair Dye](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Permanent+Hair+Dye?utm\_term=garnier-nutrisse-ultra-color-nourishing-intense-burgundy-hair-dye)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Permanent+Hair+Dye?utm_term=garnier-nutrisse-ultra-color-nourishing-intense-burgundy-hair-dye"><img alt="garnier-nutress-ultra-color-nourishing-color-cream-br3-intense-burgundy-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/garnier-nutress-ultra-color-nourishing-color-cream-br3-intense-burgundy-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Garnier Nutrisse Ultra Color Nourishing Color Cream in the shade BR3, Intense Burgundy. This hair coloring product promised a rich and vibrant color, enriched with fruit oils to nourish my hair. The cream formula was said to glide on easily, making the application process straightforward and mess-free. 

When I applied the Intense Burgundy color to my hair, I noticed that the cream formula was indeed quite easy to work with. The color seemed to cover my hair evenly, and there was no mess to clean up after the application process. I appreciated the ampoule of grapeseed oil, as it provided extra nourishment for my locks. 

However, after rinsing my hair, I was a bit disappointed with the final result. While the color did give me a reddish undertone, it was far from the intense burgundy shade I had expected. It seemed that the color had turned out more orange than burgundy, which was a bit of a letdown for me. 

Overall, the Garnier Nutrisse Ultra Color Nourishing Color Cream was easy to use and provided some color enhancement to my hair. However, the final result fell short of my expectations, and I would have liked to see a deeper shade of burgundy emerge from the product.

### [Schwarzkopf Keratin Blonde: Professional Quality Blonde Hair Color for All Hair Textures](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Permanent+Hair+Dye?utm\_term=schwarzkopf-keratin-blonde-professional-quality-blonde-hair-color-for-all-hair-textures)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Permanent+Hair+Dye?utm_term=schwarzkopf-keratin-blonde-professional-quality-blonde-hair-color-for-all-hair-textures"><img alt="schwarzkopf-keratin-blonde-001-platinum-blonde-ultra-lightening-kit-giant-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/schwarzkopf-keratin-blonde-001-platinum-blonde-ultra-lightening-kit-giant-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who bleaches her hair at home, I appreciate a product that makes the process quick and painless, without the fear of damaging my locks. 

One of the highlights of this kit is the pre-lightening serum, which conditions the hair before toning. This helps ensure even color results and keeps my hair feeling soft and hydrated. The 3-step system, which includes the pre-color serum, professional-quality color creme, and an anti-brass purple conditioner, delivers excellent color payoff with natural-looking results. 

The Keratin Blonde product line also offers a reduced risk of hair breakage and helps maintain the natural curl pattern, making it suitable for all hair textures. The long-lasting blonde results are impressive, and the product's compatibility with different hair types is a plus. 

While I found this product to be mess-free and easy to apply, I'd recommend wearing old clothing or something you don't mind staining, as bleach can be unpredictable. Additionally, I'd suggest using a well-ventilated area and following the instructions carefully, as this product can burn your scalp if left on for too long. 

In conclusion, the Schwarzkopf Keratin Blonde Platinum Blonde 001 Ultra Lightening Kit is an excellent choice for those looking for a professional-quality, long-lasting blonde color at home. With its gentle formula and hydrating benefits, it's easy to understand why this product has received such positive reviews.

### [L'Oreal Paris Feria Multi-Faceted Shimmering Permanent Hair Dye - Auburn Rose 52](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Permanent+Hair+Dye?utm\_term=loreal-paris-feria-multi-faceted-shimmering-permanent-hair-dye-auburn-rose-52)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Permanent+Hair+Dye?utm_term=loreal-paris-feria-multi-faceted-shimmering-permanent-hair-dye-auburn-rose-52"><img alt="loreal-paris-feria-multi-faceted-shimmering-permanent-hair-color-high-intensity-hair-dye-for-3x-high-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/loreal-paris-feria-multi-faceted-shimmering-permanent-hair-color-high-intensity-hair-dye-for-3x-high-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Lately, I had been struggling with finding the perfect hair color for my dark tresses. So, one day, I decided to give L'Oreal Paris Feria Multi-Faceted Shimmering Permanent Hair Color a try. The beautiful shade of Auburn Rose caught my eye from the get-go, so I decided to go with that. 

This product, oh man, gave me such a headache initially! Finding a suitable color is always a daunting task, but this had its own set of challenges. First, the application process took some time - it felt a bit tricky to me, but I guess that's because I just can't seem to get the hang of this dye thing. The smell, on the other hand, was pretty nice. It didn't give me that "I just colored my hair" vibe, which I appreciate. 

When I finally washed my hair, I was pleasantly surprised. The color turned out to be quite vibrant and definitely a game changer for my hair. The only downer was that it started to fade after about a month, but I don't think that's anything to worry about because it's a permanent hair dye. 

All things considered, despite the difficulties I faced with the application process and the eventual fading, I can't deny that I'm glad I tried Feria. It definitely made my hair stand out, and I've been getting compliments on it. So, if you're looking for a bold change, this might just be the hair dye for you. Just be prepared for the possible challenges in the beginning! 


### [Anti-Aging Liquid Hair Color for Radiant Finish](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Permanent+Hair+Dye?utm\_term=anti-aging-liquid-hair-color-for-radiant-finish)

Firstly, the liqui-creme formula spreads easily for an even application, making it a pleasure to apply. The color was rich and vibrant, giving my hair a beautiful, radiant finish. I also appreciated that the product is enriched with silk protein, which not only helps keep my hair healthy but also makes it feel fuller and silkier. 

However, there were a few downsides I encountered. The first was the scent, which was a little overpowering. Additionally, I found that the color didn't last as long as I'd hoped, fading after just a few weeks. 

Overall, if you're looking for a hair color that can give your hair a radiant finish with a hint of natural moisture, the AGEbeautiful permanent hair dye is worth considering. While it might not provide the longest-lasting color, its unique liqui-creme formula and silk protein enriched formula make it a good choice for those seeking a vibrant finish.

Additionally, the gentle formula is ideal for those with sensitive scalp, making it a go-to choice for those looking to minimize irritations. 

However, one potential downside to this product is its messiness.

However, one downside I noticed was the scent. It smelled quite strong and almost chemical-like to me. But overall, I think this product is definitely worth a try for anyone looking to maintain the color and shine of their hair for a longer period of time.

Another positive aspect of this product was the ammonia-free formula. My hair felt nourished and silky after using it, thanks to its infusion of Keratin and Silk Amino Acid. The color wasn't damaging to my hair, which was a major plus. 

In the end, I would highly recommend this Revlon Colorsilk Permanent Hair Color to anyone looking for an easy-to-use, at-home hair dye solution. The wide variety of shades available ensures that you can find the perfect color to suit your needs.

I recently tried Garnier Hair Color Nutrisse in Deep Chestnut Brown. My expectations were high as I've heard great things about this product before. The box was well-organized and I appreciated the separate ampoule of Grapeseed Fruit Oil that nourished my hair while I colored. 

The application process was easy and smooth. The color creme nourished my hair with avocado, olive, and shea oils which felt like a treat after a long day. The developer creme was simple to apply and the color creme went on smoothly without dripping. The color was rich and radiant, offering 100% grey coverage. 

One thing I noticed, however, was that the instructions didn't specify how long I should leave the creme on. I followed the general guideline for my hair type, but others might need to adjust the time based on their hair's needs. 

Another aspect I found interesting was that the conditioner creme enriched with fruit oil concentrate penetrated deep into my hair fibers, nourishing and conditioning my hair from root to tip. It even made my hair look shiny and smooth, not weighed down or greasy like some other products I've tried. 

Overall, Garnier Hair Color Nutrisse provided a pleasant dyeing experience. It nourished my hair while giving it a natural-looking color.

It's made my color so rich and natural-looking - even on my roots - and it actually seems to cover the gray hairs in my hair better than anything else I've tried.
