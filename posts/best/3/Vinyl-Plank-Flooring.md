I recently gave my home a makeover and decided to try out TrafficMaster Sandpiper Oak 6 in. x 36 in. Luxury Vinyl Plank Flooring.

Another pro was the ease of installation over most existing surfaces, including concrete, wood, and vinyl. 

However, I did experience a few cons. First, it's essential to have a perfectly flat subfloor, otherwise, imperfections will become noticeable.

One thing that stood out to me was the flexibility of the planks, which eased my installation process, and the variety of finishes available, ensuring a perfect match for any living space. However, I encountered a slight obstacle - while the planks are the perfect length, I found it challenging to lock long sides into the mated planks due to the length being too long for my arms. 

Another highlight of the COREtec Plus that I noticed during the installation was the top-quality packaging and delivery. My order arrived in pristine condition and was timely. 

Overall, I'm very happy with my decision to choose the COREtec Plus 5" Norwegian Maple. Its ease of installation, durability, and stunning appearance have transformed my living spaces, and I would highly recommend it to others.

As I walked into my friend's beautifully remodeled home, I couldn't help but notice the striking luxury vinyl flooring that adorned the entire space. The Lucida Surfaces' Monocore collection was the perfect blend of color and style, but what stood out to me the most was its durability and ease of installation.

The click-lock installation made it incredibly easy to put in place, without the need for any messy adhesive or glue.

One of the benefits of using this product was its simple DIY click installation.

To conclude, LifeProof Woodacres Oak 8.7 inches wide vinyl plank flooring is a perfect blend of style and practicality. It's durable, easy to maintain, and looks great.

## Buyer's Guide

Vinyl plank flooring is a popular alternative to traditional hardwood floors, offering durability, easy maintenance, and a variety of styles to choose from. This buyer's guide will help you understand the key features, considerations, and advice for selecting the best vinyl plank flooring for your home. 


### Important Features to Consider

When shopping for vinyl plank flooring, some important features to consider include the following: 
1. Water resistance: Look for flooring with a high water resistance rating as it will protect your floors from spills, humidity, and accidental damage. 2. Texture: Choose a flooring with a realistic texture to mimic the look of natural wood. 3. Installation: Check if the vinyl plank flooring is easy to install, as some options require professional installation while others can be installed as a DIY project. 4. Sturdiness: Select flooring that is sturdy enough to withstand heavy foot traffic and furniture without showing signs of wear and tear. 


### Types of Vinyl Plank Flooring

There are two main types of vinyl plank flooring: luxury vinyl plank (LVP) and rigid core vinyl plank (RCVP). 1. LVP is made from multiple layers of vinyl with a softer underlay for comfort and provides a more realistic look and feel. It is suitable for most residential applications, including basements and laundry rooms. 2. RCVP is made from a solid core of vinyl with a rigid base, making it more durable and resistant to damage. It is ideal for high-traffic areas, such as kitchens and entryways. 


### Maintenance and Care

Proper maintenance and care of your vinyl plank flooring are essential for its longevity. Some general maintenance tips include: 
1. Clean frequently using a soft-bristled broom or vacuum cleaner to remove dirt and debris. 2. Avoid using harsh chemicals, as they can damage the flooring. Instead, use a mild cleaner specifically designed for vinyl flooring. 3. Remove spills quickly to prevent staining. 4. Use protective pads under furniture to prevent scratches and indentations. 


### Advice for First-Time Buyers

When purchasing vinyl plank flooring for the first time, it's essential to be well-informed and follow these tips: 
1. Research different brands and models to find the best quality flooring for your budget. 2. Read customer reviews to get a better understanding of the product's performance and durability. 3. Consult with a professional installer if you're unsure about the installation process. 4. Ask your manufacturer or retailer about any warranty or return policy in case of defects or issues with the flooring. 


## FAQ


### What is Vinyl Plank Flooring?

Vinyl Plank Flooring (VPF) is a stylish and practical flooring solution that mimics the look and feel of natural materials such as wood, stone, and tile. Manufactured with various layers of vinyl materials, VPF is crafted to appear more lifelike and authentic than traditional vinyl flooring. This type of flooring is incredibly robust, water-resistant, and simple to install, making it a preferred choice for houses, offices, and public spaces.


### What are the Perks of Opting for Vinyl Plank Flooring?

VPF offers numerous advantages that outperform other types of flooring. Its sturdiness and water resistance make it the ideal flooring solution for high-traffic regions where dampness exposure is common. VPF is a costless alternative to natural materials like wood and stone, and its high resistance against foot traffic and spills maintains its allure with minimal wear and tear. 

VPF's ease of maintenance is an additional advantage. Unlike other flooring materials like carpet, VPF does not absorb water or stains, which simplifies the cleaning process. Sweeping, mopping, or vacuuming regularly can help keep your VPF surface looking fresh. Moreover, VPF provides a warm and cozy atmosphere underfoot, making it a perfect choice for living spaces.


### What are the Different Kinds of Vinyl Plank Flooring?

VPF comes in various classes, each offering unique features and benefits. Rigid VPF is the most robust and provides excellent water resistance. This makes it ideal for areas with high moisture levels, like kitchens and bathrooms. 

Flexible VPF, on the other hand, is more pliable and can be installed on practically any subsurface without additional preparation. It is suited to areas with uneven flooring or when sound absorption is crucial. Waterproof VPF, specifically designed to prevent water infiltration, is a fantastic option for basement or utility room installations.


### How do You Set Up Vinyl Plank Flooring?

Installing VPF is generally fuss-free, and it can be accomplished on your own or with professional assistance. The majority of VPF products possess a 'click-lock' system, where the planks simply interlock with each other to create a solid surface. This method does not require adhesives and can be done swiftly.

In contrast, if installation involves glue, apply an adhesive to the backside of the plank before laying it down. Make sure the surface is meticulously prepared, washed, and devoid of any clutter before the installation process. A sealant should also be used to safeguard the edges of the planks and establish a waterproof barrier.


### Is Vinyl Plank Flooring Environment-friendly?

VPF is generally regarded as eco-friendly because it is produced from recycled materials and is energy-efficient. The manufacturing process does not consume natural resources like water or wood and is more sustainable than conventional methods. Moreover, VPF is recyclable, further reducing its environmental impact.

Although the production process is environmentally friendly, certain toxic chemicals like phthalates are generated in the manufacturing of vinyl. Choosing a phthalate-free VPF can ensure that your flooring choice is indeed eco-friendly.


### How Much does Vinyl Plank Flooring Cost?

The cost of VPF differs depending on factors such as brand, quality, design, and the installation process. Typically, you might expect to pay between $1 and $8 per square foot for VPF. Rigid and waterproof VPF tend to be on the expensive end, while flexible VPF is more reasonably priced. Remember, installation costs are not typically included in the above price range, further increasing your overall budget. Despite this, VPF is still an affordable option compared to other flooring alternatives
