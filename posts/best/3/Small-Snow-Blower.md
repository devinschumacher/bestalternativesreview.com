<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Small+Snow+Blower?utm_term=husqvarna-st227p-254cc-two-stage-power-steering-snow-blower"><img alt="husqvarna-st227p-27-254cc-two-stage-snow-blower-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/husqvarna-st227p-27-254cc-two-stage-snow-blower-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Craftsman 21-Inch 123 CC Single-Stage Gas Snow Blower](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Small+Snow+Blower?utm\_term=craftsman-21-inch-123-cc-single-stage-gas-snow-blower)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Small+Snow+Blower?utm_term=craftsman-21-inch-123-cc-single-stage-gas-snow-blower"><img alt="craftsman-21-in-123-cc-single-stage-gas-snow-blower-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/craftsman-21-in-123-cc-single-stage-gas-snow-blower-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try out the Craftsman 21-inch Single-Stage Snow Blower, and I must say, it made my snow clearing duties much more manageable. One of the first things that struck me was the powerful 123cc 4-cycle OHV engine, which not only made quick work of the snow but also ran smoothly without needing to mix gas and oil. 

The 21-inch clearing width made short work of the deep snow, while the large mitten-grip handle allowed for easy chute control and effortless direction changes. The auger design also held the ground firmly, ensuring that the snow blower left a virtually clean surface behind. 

However, there were a few aspects that could've been improved. The recoil start was a bit finicky at times, and I found myself pulling the primer button multiple times before it would start. Additionally, while the snow blower can handle deep snow well, its plastic wheels tended to get caked with snow, making it a bit challenging to navigate through thick, wet snow. 

Overall, the Craftsman Single-Stage Snow Blower proved to be a reliable and powerful tool for tackling snowy walkways and driveways. With a few tweaks to the starting mechanism and wheel design, it could be even better suited for the rigors of winter weather.

It saved me from a lot of frustration during the first few starts. 

Now, when it comes to the self-propelled feature, it certainly adds a layer of convenience - I just had to choose one of the six forward speeds and two reverse speeds to match my pace.

The self-leveling chute was a huge plus too, adjusting the direction of the snow discharge from the comfort of my seat.

One thing that stood out to me was the 7-inch wheels, which provided great mobility and allowed me to tackle my long driveway with ease. However, I did encounter an issue when I realized the unit only works on 120 volts, which might limit its use for some people. 

The 20-inch clearing path and 10-inch clearing depth were quite impressive, as well. I did notice that the snow blower struggled with heavy wet snow, but, let's be real, what doesn't? 

Overall, I'm quite pleased with this snow thrower and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an environmentally friendly and efficient way to battle the winter weather. Just remember, as with any product, it's important to read the fine print and check for any compatibility issues before making your purchase!

## Buyer's Guide

A small snow blower can be an excellent investment for those who live in an area prone to winter snowfall. These compact machines are designed to navigate tight spaces and can significantly reduce the time it takes to clear a driveway or sidewalk. With so many options available, it's essential to consider the following features, considerations, and general advice when choosing a small snow blower. 


### Power Source

Snow blowers can be electric or gas-powered. Electric models are typically lighter and more eco-friendly, but they have the disadvantage of having a limited working range due to the rechargeable battery. Gas-powered snow blowers offer more power and a greater working range, but they produce exhaust fumes and are generally heavier.

### Snow Clearing Width

Consider the width of the snow clearing path when choosing a small snow blower. A wider path means that you can clear a larger area in a shorter amount of time. However, you may need to maneuver the machine in tight spaces, so a narrower width might be more suitable for some users. Consider your specific needs and the average snowfall in your area to help make this decision. 


### Auger Type

The auger is the part of the snow blower that moves the snow. There are two main types of augers: single-stage and two-stage. Single-stage augers are simpler and less expensive but can be less effective at handling heavy snow accumulations. Two-stage augers are more powerful and can handle larger snowfalls but are generally more expensive.

### Advisory

When using a small snow blower, wear appropriate protective gear, including gloves, goggles, and insulated clothing. Clear the path of any obstructions before starting the machine and use caution when operating near stairs, steps, or other elevated surfaces. Always read the owner's manual carefully before operating the snow blower, and keep the machine well-maintained to ensure its longevity and proper performance.

### What is a small snow blower, and how does it differ from larger models?

A small snow blower is a compact and lightweight snow removal machine designed for smaller-sized sidewalks, driveways, and patios. It typically has lower power output and reduced clearing capacity compared to larger snow blowers. Small snow blowers are more suitable for residential use and can be easier to store and maneuver due to their compact size. 

Due to their smaller size, they are generally less expensive and more cost-effective than larger models. However, they may not be as powerful or efficient in clearing snow from larger areas, such as commercial properties or driveways with extensive parking spaces. Nonetheless, small snow blowers are ideal for those who need a reliable and efficient snow removal solution for their smaller residential property. 


### What are the benefits of using a small snow blower?

Small snow blowers offer several advantages for homeowners and property managers. Firstly, they are lightweight and easy to maneuver, making them more accessible and convenient for users of all ages and abilities. Their compact size also allows them to navigate tight spaces and corners with ease, enabling efficient snow removal in small areas. 

Secondly, small snow blowers are typically less expensive than larger models, making them a more budget-friendly option for those who need an affordable snow removal solution. Additionally, their lower power consumption results in reduced fuel or electricity costs, contributing to their overall cost-effectiveness. Lastly, their more manageable size makes storage less of an issue, especially for those with limited space.

### What are the main features to consider when buying a small snow blower?

When selecting a small snow blower, consider the following features to ensure you choose the best option for your needs. First, assess the size of the area you need to clear since this will determine the appropriate snow blower size. Next, consider the type of fuel or power source (electric, gas, or battery-powered) that best suits your needs and budget. Consider the snow blower's clearing width, which determines how much snow it can remove at once, and the auger height, which determines how deep it can remove snow. 

Other important features include the snow-blower's weight, ease of maneuverability, durability, and additional accessories such as headlights or a remote start. Reading online reviews and consulting with experts can help you make a more informed decision and find the best small snow blower for your needs. 


### What are the disadvantages of using a small snow blower?

Despite their benefits, small snow blowers do have some limitations. They typically have lower power output and reduced clearing capacity compared to larger models, making them less suitable for clearing significant amounts of snow or larger areas such as commercial properties. Moreover, their lower power consumption may result in reduced snow clearance efficiency when dealing with heavy snowfall. 

Additionally, while small snow blowers are generally more cost-effective, some models may have higher upfront costs due to their lower power output and reduced efficiency. Their smaller size also means they may not be as powerful or durable as larger models, potentially requiring more frequent repairs or maintenance over time.

To ensure your small snow blower operates efficiently and safely, regular maintenance is essential. Here are some common maintenance tasks to consider: Check the air filter and replace it if necessary, clean the impeller, inspect the engine oil, and replace it if required. Additionally, ensure the snow blower's chute and auger are free of debris, and lubricate moving parts regularly. 

It's also crucial to store your small snow blower properly when not in use. This may involve draining the fuel tank, replacing the spark plug, and covering the machine to protect it from moisture and dust. By performing these maintenance tasks, you can extend the lifespan of your snow blower and ensure it continues to function effectively in the future. 


### How do I choose the best small snow blower for my needs?

To find the best small snow blower for your needs, consider the following factors: Assess the size of the area you need to clear and the amount of snowfall you typically experience. This will help you determine the appropriate size and power output required for your snow blower.
