### [Xotic CyberPowerPC Gamer Xtreme Desktop PC with i7 & RTX 3060 Ti](https://serp.ly/amazon/Xotic+Pc?utm\_term=xotic-cyberpowerpc-gamer-xtreme-desktop-pc-with-i7-rtx-3060-ti)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Xotic+Pc?utm_term=xotic-cyberpowerpc-gamer-xtreme-desktop-pc-with-i7-rtx-3060-ti"><img alt="cyberpowerpc-gamer-xtreme-gaming-desktop-computer-intel-core-i7-11700f-rtx-3060-ti-16gb-ddr4-500gb-s-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cyberpowerpc-gamer-xtreme-gaming-desktop-computer-intel-core-i7-11700f-rtx-3060-ti-16gb-ddr4-500gb-s-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to use this impressive gaming desktop from CyberPowerPC, and I must say, it surpassed my expectations! First off, the 16GB RAM and the combination of a 500GB SSD and 1TB HDD ensured that I could store and work on my projects smoothly. And with the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti dedicated graphics card, my videos and games rendered with stunning clarity and high frame rates. 

However, when it came to using a mouse and keyboard, I noticed that the mouse pad that came bundled with the package wasn't quite up to the mark. Though it featured a high-quality cloth surface that enabled smooth mouse gliding, it didn't truly measure up to my expectations. 

Although the 11th Gen Intel Core i7-11700F CPU wasn't really a problem, the integrated Wi-Fi and 10/100/1000 GbE LAN networking felt a bit redundant, especially since we are now in the era of blazing-fast 5G and 6GHz Wi-Fi connectivity. And the lack of a dedicated optical drive also seemed like a missed opportunity, although it wasn't a deal breaker for me. 

One of the most impressive features of this system was the included air cooling system that kept the machine running smoothly despite the demanding workload I put it through. Its size of 19.5x9.1x18.1 inches was also quite compact for a high-performance gaming system like this. 

Overall, while there were a few nitpicks I had during my experience with this CyberPowerPC Gamer Xtreme Gaming Desktop, the positives definitely outweighed the negatives, making it a solid choice for anyone looking for a performance-packed desktop with the latest gadgets inside.
