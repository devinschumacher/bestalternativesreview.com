When I first set it up, I was surprised by how sturdy and well-designed it is, even though assembly was a bit tricky. 

One feature that really stood out to me is its durability. The tempered glass top and lower shelf can really hold their weight - 50 lbs on the top shelf, and 25 lbs on the lower shelf. The craftsmanship is also top-notch, as the handcrafted finish adds a touch of luxury to the piece. 

However, it's a bit tricky to assemble and not ideal for someone who's not very handy. So, be prepared to spend some serious time on assembly. Lastly, be sure to use a soft, dry cloth for cleaning, as harsh chemicals or abrasive materials can damage the elegant finish. 

Overall, the Uriel Console Table is a great-looking piece that adds a touch of refined class to any room. While there's a bit of a learning curve when it comes to assembly, it's worth the investment.
