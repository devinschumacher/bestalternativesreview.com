Taking care of your Seiko clock is essential to ensure it lasts for years. Firstly, keep the clock away from direct sunlight, as this can cause the clock face to fade or discolor over time. It's also a good idea to dust the clock regularly using a soft brush or cloth to prevent any dirt buildup on the clock face. 

If your Seiko clock has a battery-operated movement, change the batteries every one to two years. Using alkaline batteries can also help prolong the life of your clock. Additionally, avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials on your clock, as this can damage the clock's finish or mechanisms. Lastly, if you encounter any issues with your clock, refer to the manufacturer's warranty or customer support for assistance.

### What is the warranty on Seiko Clocks?

Seiko offers a warranty on their clocks, which varies depending on the specific model and collection. Generally, Seiko clocks come with a 1-year limited warranty, which covers defects in material and workmanship. However, certain clocks may have longer warranties or additional coverage, so it's essential to refer to the manufacturer's warranty for the specific details applicable to your clock. 

During the warranty period, Seiko will repair or replace any defective parts or components of your clock, free of charge. However, the warranty does not cover wear and tear or any damage caused by misuse or neglect. To ensure your clock remains covered under the warranty, follow the manufacturer's instructions for proper care and maintenance of the clock. 


### Are Seiko Clocks environmentally friendly?

Seiko is committed to reducing its environmental impact and has introduced various eco-friendly initiatives in its products. For example, Seiko has introduced a line of Solar Dial clocks, which use solar power as their energy source. These clocks are self-sufficient and do not require a battery, making them an environmentally friendly choice. 

Additionally, Seiko is committed to using sustainable materials in its clocks. They use eco-friendly materials such as cedarwood and bamboo, which have lower carbon emissions than traditional materials like oak and maple. By choosing a Seiko clock, you can make a sustainable and eco-friendly choice for your home or office.
