The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B has been a game-changer for me, offering a reliable and versatile solution for various projects I've been working on. From connecting to a 5 bay USB3 drive caddy to running as my PLEX server, this single-board computer has truly become an indispensable part of my setup. 

One of the most significant advancements with the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, in comparison to its predecessors, is the improved performance in terms of memory, connectivity, and overall compute capacity. The 64-bit quad-core processor has been a valuable addition, providing a smooth multitasking experience even during memory-intensive processes. I've also appreciated the dual-band wireless LAN and Bluetooth 5.0 capabilities, offering seamless connectivity and compatibility with various devices. 

However, one area where the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B could use some improvements is the thermals. The increased RAM and power consumption from the wireless modules can sometimes lead to thermal throttling, especially under heavy loads. To circumvent this, I've had to invest in additional cooling measures, such as a heat sink, to ensure optimal performance. 

In conclusion, the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B has proven to be a valuable addition to my tech arsenal. Despite the minor hiccups, the device has consistently delivered impressive performance and capabilities, making it a worthy investment for anyone looking to dive into the world of single-board computing.

I recently had the chance to try out the Franklin T9 mobile hotspot. Overall, I found it to be a compact and portable electronic device, suitable for those needing a reliable internet connection on the go. With its smooth black enclosure, it certainly looked the part of a modern hotspot.

This is beneficial for users who require multiple devices to be online at the same time. The built-in OLED display allows for easy monitoring of its status, with unique icons and text panels updating the device's status in real-time. 

However, there were a few drawbacks I encountered during my experience. The device's signal range was limited at times, causing some connectivity issues in certain areas.

Additionally, the SIM card setup was a bit complicated and required some extra setup steps. 

In conclusion, the Franklin T9 mobile hotspot is a compact and portable device with a good signal range and decent battery life. While it could benefit from improvements in its signal range and a more streamlined registration process, overall, it is an effective tool for users who require a reliable internet connection while on the move.
