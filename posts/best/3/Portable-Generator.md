### [GENMAX Portable Inverter Generator - 6000W Open Frame Gas Engine with Ultra Lightweight Design for Backup & Job](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Portable+Generator?utm\_term=genmax-portable-inverter-generator-6000w-open-frame-gas-engine-with-ultra-lightweight-design-for-backup-job)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Portable+Generator?utm_term=genmax-portable-inverter-generator-6000w-open-frame-gas-engine-with-ultra-lightweight-design-for-backup-job"><img alt="genmax-portable-inverter-generator-6000w-open-frame-gas-powered-high-speed-engine-with-electric-star-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/genmax-portable-inverter-generator-6000w-open-frame-gas-powered-high-speed-engine-with-electric-star-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the GENMAX Portable Inverter Generator, and let me just say, it's a game-changer for those who need a reliable power source during emergencies, camping trips, or even job sites. It's got a 312 cc OHV 4-stroke engine that delivers 5,250W running power and 6,000W peak power. Pretty impressive, right? 

The highlight of the generator? The electric start feature. I never knew I'd enjoy using 'on/off push-button power' so much. It's a breeze to operate, and the battery included means you're good to go, even in chilly weather. And with the quiet 70 dBA noise rating, this generator feels more like a friendly neighbor than a noisy nuisance. 

But there's even more to the GENMAX. It's got a CO shutdown sensor, which automatically shuts off the generator if it detects dangerous levels of carbon monoxide. That's a safety feature I appreciate. Plus, it's hybrid, meaning it generates clean power for your sensitive electronics. 

One downside? The outlets are a bit cramped, so if you're using multiple devices, you might want to make some adjustments. And the company's support isn't the most responsive. So there's room for improvement there. 

Overall, the GENMAX Portable Inverter Generator is a handy tool to have, considering its power output and quiet operation. Just remember to treat it with care, and you'll reap the benefits.

Upon assembly, the generator felt sturdy and well-built. It was easy to set up and start, with intuitive controls and minimal noise. However, I noticed that it weighed a fair amount, making it somewhat challenging to move around.

Thankfully, I got in touch with DuroMax's customer service, which was prompt and helpful, and they suggested the generator may require a hotter spark plug to make the transition from natural gas to propane more manageable. 

Though these issues were a bit frustrating, I'm overall quite satisfied with the performance and durability of the DuroMax XP13000HXT Tri Fuel generator.

### Which portable generator is the most fuel-efficient?

Honda EU2200i generator has an impressive fuel efficiency, offering up to 9.6 hours of operation on a single gallon of fuel, making it the most fuel-efficient generator in our roundup. This is mostly attributed to its advanced inverter technology, which works to maximize the power output while minimizing fuel consumption. 

The generator also features an automatic choke and an eco-mode, which can further enhance its fuel efficiency by automatically adjusting its engine speed based on the load requirement. This results in consistent and stable power output without compromising on fuel economy. However, it should be noted that the performance of a portable generator can also vary depending on factors such as the temperature and altitude of the environment it's being used in. 


### What is the noise level of a portable generator?

Generally, the noise level of a portable generator can vary between different models and manufacturers. However, in our roundup, the WEN 56200i generator produces the lowest noise level of just 51.5 dBa at 25% load, making it one of the quietest generators available on the market. This is significantly lower than the average noise level of a window air conditioner, which hovers around 50-70 dBa. 

The generator's noise reduction technology and muffled engine design contribute to its quiet operation. Additionally, it features a throttle-controlled inverter, which adjusts the engine speed based on the load requirement, further contributing to its low noise level. However, it should be noted that the noise level of a portable generator can also be influenced by the type of engine and its placement, so it's always best to consult the manufacturer's specifications for accurate information.
