Another element that caught my eye was the wide array of included accessories. From a cable stopper for maximum safety to gloves perfect for the secure grip on the adjustable dip handles, no corner was cut, enabling users like me to fully customize the workout experience based on our personal preferences.

The 700-pound weight capacity was more than enough to challenge even the most experienced lifters. 

However, setting it up was not the easiest task. It took my partner and me a considerable amount of time to assemble the Smith Machine.

However, these issues have not significantly impacted my overall satisfaction with the FT2 Functional Trainer. 

In conclusion, the Inspire Fitness FT2 Functional Trainer is an excellent investment for anyone looking to enhance their home gym setup.

With a maximum weight recommendation of 500 pounds, I felt confident and in control every step of the way. 

However, there were a few minor drawbacks that I encountered during my experience. First, I found the assembly instructions to be slightly confusing and difficult to follow. It took me a bit longer than expected to put everything together.

While the FT2 has many positives, there have been a few minor issues that have cropped up. One of these is the leg attachment rollers, which have a tendency to slide off center and sometimes come off completely. This appears to be a design issue that could be addressed with stronger or more secure fasteners. 

Another issue I encountered was the cable coating on one of the leg cables that came off during use. This may have been due to the specific vendor I purchased from, so it's worth considering purchasing directly from Inspire Fitness to avoid any potential issues. 

Overall, the Inspire Fitness FT2 Functional Trainer has been a fantastic addition to my home gym. Its versatility, ease of use, and compact design make it a great investment for anyone looking to create a functional workout space. Despite

### [Marcy SM-4033 Smith Cable Machine Home Gym for Fitness Training](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Smith+Cable+Machine?utm\_term=marcy-sm-4033-smith-cable-machine-home-gym-for-fitness-training)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Smith+Cable+Machine?utm_term=marcy-sm-4033-smith-cable-machine-home-gym-for-fitness-training"><img alt="marcy-sm-4033-smith-machine-cage-multi-purpose-home-gym-training-system-red-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/marcy-sm-4033-smith-machine-cage-multi-purpose-home-gym-training-system-red-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I spent the past month putting together this Marcy SM-4033 Smith Machine Cage Multi Purpose Home Gym Training System and I'm ready to share my thoughts on the experience. The first thing I noticed was the sheer size of the thing - it's quite a beast to assemble. But let's be real, if you're looking for a home gym equipment, you might as well go big or go home, right? 

The instructions were clear and the manual was comprehensive, although I still had to spend a few hours on the phone with the customer support for some clarifications. The assembly process was a labor of love that required a lot of patience and perseverance. In the end, it felt like a fun project and not just a tedious job. 

Once it was finally put together, the Marcy Smith Machine truly is a formidable piece of equipment. The cable pulls and resistance bands offer a wide range of exercises to choose from, and the free weight rack adds that extra layer of versatility. However, I did notice that the pulley system could be smoother, which might be worth some lubrication in the future. 

As for the maximum user weight capacity of 300 pounds, I'd say it's plenty, even for someone who is a bit larger. The build quality is solid, and the weight plates don't wobble or feel unstable when in use. 

One thing that surprised me was the bench. It's quite hefty and cumbersome, making it a challenge to move around. It also lacks a backrest, which left me feeling a bit vulnerable while bench pressing. 

The size of the machine is another consideration - it takes up quite a bit of space. So make sure you have a dedicated area in your home to accommodate it. 

Overall, the Marcy SM-4033 Smith Machine is a fantastic addition to any home gym enthusiast. It's sturdy, functional, and offers a wide range of exercises to help you achieve your fitness goals. Just be prepared for the assembly process and the extra space it'll take up in your home.

However, I did encounter a few issues that I thought were worth mentioning. The chrome-finished box iron that slides up and down to adjust the pulleys felt rather cheap and didn't slide as smoothly as I would have liked. Also, the paint quality on the frame wasn't the best, and it did scratch quite easily during the assembly process. 

But those minor issues aside, I'm thrilled with my Mikolo Smith Machine Home Gym. It's a fantastic investment for anyone looking to bring a robust, versatile home gym into their life.

I recently got my hands on the French Fitness FSR90 Functional Trainer Smith & Squat Rack Machine, and I must say it has revolutionized my home gym experience. This versatile piece of equipment is perfect for anyone looking to perform powerful strength training workouts. 

One feature that stands out is the adjustable safety stops on the press bar. This allows for various strength training workouts and ensures a proper form during exercises. The full range of resistance training options for all fitness goals is another significant benefit. 

The heavy-duty cables and pulley system make every lift smooth and effortless. The thick steel barbell safety hooks with quick and easy height adjustment provide safety and convenience. The adjustable/removable dip handles are also a great addition for different grip options during chin-up exercises. 

However, the machine lacks an actual usage guide, which could be helpful in properly setting it up for different functions. It can take some time to figure out all the attachments and combinations, as not everything is intuitive. 

Overall, I highly recommend the French Fitness FSR90 to anyone looking to upgrade their home gym. It's well made, easy to use, and the quality is top-notch.
