I recently tried this ZYER Glass Pie Plate, and it was a game-changer for my pie-making sessions. The clear glass allows me to keep an eye on the baking process while ensuring a uniformly golden crust and a moist texture on the inside. The non-porous surface is a bonus, as it doesn't absorb food odors or stains. 

I loved the petal-shaped handles on the pie pan, making it easy to manage with hot pads or oven gloves when handling a scorching hot pie. The pie plates themselves are perfect for smaller occasions or a family of about 2-4 people, ensuring that there's just the right amount of pie for everyone, without any leftovers going to waste. 

One of the best things about this set of pie plates is that they are microwave, oven, freezer, and dishwasher safe, offering a flexible baking solution that caters to various cuisine preferences in your household. The mini pie pan is also oven safe up to 482°F and dishwasher safe or hand wash for quick, easy cleanup. This made it an excellent addition to my kitchen, and I'm sure it will make a fantastic gift for any avid cook or baker in your life. 


### [Goodcook Pie Dish: Perfect for Tasty Treats](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Pie+Plate?utm\_term=goodcook-pie-dish-perfect-for-tasty-treats)

I recently gave the Good Cook Stoneware, a 9"x9"x1.9" pie dish, a try in my kitchen. The unglazed bottom of the dish caught my attention, as it promised even heat distribution, which is crucial when baking. Upon first use, I noticed the dish could easily fit into a standard oven, making it perfect for a delicious homemade pie. 

Unfortunately, I faced a few complications during my experience. Firstly, the shipping care left me disappointed, as my dish arrived in pieces – shattered beyond repair. The frustration of hearing the damage and not being able to open the package intensified my anger. I wanted to love this Good Cook Pie Dish, but the shipping experience soured my impression.

I've recently started baking pies in my own kitchen and the Bia Cordon Bleu Round Pie Dish set of 2 has made a significant improvement in the appearance and taste of my desserts. The high-quality porcelain is both durable and elegant, easily fitting into any kitchen decor. 

I was initially skeptical about investing in expensive bakeware, but these pie dishes have proven me wrong. The glazed porcelain doesn't stain or crack like some cheaper alternatives, ensuring that my pies always turn out perfect. It's an added bonus that they are dishwasher, oven, and microwave safe. The dimensions and capacity are ideal for a family gathering or a gathering of friends. 

While initially it may seem like an unnecessary expense, the Bia Cordon Bleu Round Pie Dish set of 2 is definitely worth the investment. The unique combination of durability, elegance, and versatility make it my go-to choice for the perfect pie dish. The only downside I can think of is that they don't come with lids, but with the right baking parchment or foil, that's easily remedied.

One of the most appealing features of this pie plate is its durability - it's safe to use in the microwave, dishwasher, freezer, and oven. When compared to some of my other baking dishes, this one is truly a champ in the heat, and it remains unscathed even after countless uses. 

However, no product is perfect, and this pie plate is no exception. While its double-glazed non-stick finish does help with food release, I still find that I need to carefully adjust the temperature when using it in the oven. Additionally, the pie plate can be quite heavy when full of food, which can occasionally be a challenge to handle. 

Overall, my experience with the Zaklady Zara Pie Plate has been satisfying. The intricate details of its design and its impressive durability make it a beloved piece in my kitchen. Despite the weight issue and occasional temperature adjustments needed, I'm confident this pie plate will continue to serve me well for many years to come.

### [The Pioneer Woman 9-inch Stoneware Pie Plate - Baking Perfection](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Pie+Plate?utm\_term=the-pioneer-woman-9-inch-stoneware-pie-plate-baking-perfection)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Pie+Plate?utm_term=the-pioneer-woman-9-inch-stoneware-pie-plate-baking-perfection"><img alt="the-pioneer-woman-9-inch-stoneware-pie-dish-1-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/the-pioneer-woman-9-inch-stoneware-pie-dish-1-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Pioneer Woman's 9-inch Stoneware Pie Dish truly stands out as an attractive and durable option for home bakers. The unique floral design on the edge and the vibrant color scheme make it a stunning addition to any kitchen, perfect for both casual cooking and special events like weddings or Christmas. I've been using this dish for quite some time and have fond memories of baking my first apple pie in it. 

What really strikes me about this pie dish is its exceptional build quality. The sturdy stoneware construction ensures even heat distribution when you're cooking, leading to beautifully baked pies with a perfect texture. Additionally, the dish can easily handle high temperatures, both in the oven and the dishwasher, making it both safe and convenient to use. 

A major drawback, however, is that the dish has a larger capacity than standard glass pie plates, which can lead to overfilling and, in my experience, a much longer baking time. Despite its robust design, the large size may also make it harder to store in a smaller kitchen. 

I also recently encountered an issue with the dish when I used it for baking. It cracked in half after only a few uses, quite possibly due to its significant capacity. This has left me with concerns about the longevity of the product, despite its attractive design and top-notch performance. 

In conclusion, while I highly recommend The Pioneer Woman's 9-inch Stoneware Pie Dish for its beautiful design and exceptional cooking capabilities, its higher price compared to less durable alternatives and my personal experience with the dish cracking prematurely do cause some hesitation.

## Buyer's Guide

Pie plates are essential for any baking enthusiast, providing the perfect base for a variety of pies and desserts. When selecting a pie plate, there are several features and considerations to take into account. In this guide, we will explore the important aspects of pie plates, offering general advice for making the best choice for your baking needs. 


### Material

Pie plates are typically made from ceramic, metal, or glass. Ceramic plates are durable and heat-resistant, making them a popular choice for many bakers. Metal pie plates, on the other hand, tend to be lighter and distribute heat more evenly. Glass pie plates are also an option, though they can be more prone to cracking. Consider your preferred material based on ease of use, durability, and heat resistance.

### Shape and Size

Pie plates come in a variety of shapes and sizes, so it's essential to choose the one that best suits your baking needs. Round pie plates are the most common and versatile option, allowing you to create pies, cobblers, and other desserts. Square or rectangular pie plates are more suitable for savory dishes like quiches and frittatas. Ensure the dimensions of the pie plate align with your recipes and baking dishes for a perfect fit. 


### Rim Style

Pie plates come with either a fluted or smooth rim. Fluted rims give a traditional and elegant look to your baked goods, while smooth rims provide a more modern aesthetic. Choose a rim style based on your personal preference and the desired look of your finished desserts. Additionally, consider the ease of handling and storage when making your decision.

### What Does a Pie Plate Do?

A pie plate is an essential piece of bakeware that is used for cooking and serving pies. With its shallow, round shape, it's specifically designed to be a perfect vessel for these delicious desserts. Generally, they come with a thickness between 0.5 to 1 inch, although some ultra-thin options may be a mere 0.25 inches. The primary purpose of the pie plate is to evenly distribute heat, maintain shape, and ensure consistency throughout the cooking process, which makes it an ideal choice for pie-making.

There are many materials that pie plates can be made from, each bringing its unique qualities. Some common materials include aluminum, ceramic, cast iron, and silicone. Aluminum is renowned for its even heat distribution, lightweight, and easy clean-up properties. Ceramic and cast iron are excellent choices for maintaining heat well and providing a crispy crust on the bottom. 


### What's So Good About Using a Pie Plate?

The benefits of using a pie plate when baking pies are numerous. First off, it offers even heat distribution, retains heat superbly, and prevents sticking for easy removal post-bake. Pie plates can also accommodate various sizes of pies to suit your needs. Durable, easy to clean, and available in different materials and designs, they offer a lot of flexibility and versatility for your baking adventures.

Additionally, pie plates have uses beyond just pies! They're perfect for baking and serving other yummy baked goods like quiches, lasagnas, and casseroles. Their adaptability really comes in handy during family gatherings and holiday times when pies are quite popular.

### What Are Baking Dishes Made Of?

A pie plate's material can have a significant impact on the kind of crust your pie gets. The standard materials include aluminum, ceramic, cast iron, and silicone. 1) Aluminum - it's lightweight, great for even heat distribution, and effortless to clean. 2) Ceramic - it retains heat really well and gives that perfect crispy bottom crust. 3) Cast Iron - it retains heat brilliantly, provides a deliciously crisp bottom crust, and can be used on stove-top and oven-to. 

4) Silicone - with its flexibility, this one is lightweight, non-stick, and heat resistant too. And guess what? It comes in a variety of colors that make it a favorite among bakers! However, it isn't as heat-resistant or durable compared to other materials, so it's not the best if you're planning to bake at higher temperatures or if you want it to withstand direct heat for longer. 


### How Can I Clean a Pie Plate?

After you have finished baking, let the pie plate cool down to room temperature to avoid any burns when handling. Once it's safe, you can gently scrape off any remaining food or burnt bits with a spatula or a plastic scraper. The following steps involve warm soapy water and a sponge or soft cloth for a thorough cleaning of your pie plate. For stubborn stains, a baking soda and water mixture or a commercial oven cleaning solution might come in handy. But remember, stay away from abrasive materials like steel wool, as they can damage the surface of your pie plate. 

Once cleaned, it would be wise to dry the pie plate entirely. You could either air-dry it or wipe it down with a clean, dry towel. And remember, never submerge your pie plate in water - it can distort its shape or cause damage to its surface over time.

### How Does Preheating Help Me When Baking a Pie?

Preheating your oven to the suggested temperature is essential for a perfectly baked pie. Typically, 375°F or 350°F (convection oven) is a good starting point. But the exact temperature may vary depending on your recipe and pie plate material. Always refer to the recipe instructions or your pie plate's user guide before proceeding. 

Once the oven is heated, place the pie plate on the middle rack, ensuring even heat circulation around your pie. If possible, remember to turn and bake halfway through. Monitor your pie to prevent burning or overcooked filling.

Always use oven mitts or heatproof potholders when handling a hot pie plate to avoid burns.


### Can I Use a Pie Plate as a Casserole Dish?

Of course! A pie plate isn't just for pies; it's versatile enough for casseroles, quiches, and lasagnas too. Its multifunctional nature makes it a valuable addition to your kitchenware tools, offering convenience and a single dish option for both sweet and savory baked dishes. 

When using your pie plate as a casserole dish, follow similar temperature and cooking instructions as you would for a pie. Also, consider using a dish with a tight-fitting lid, like ceramic or glass, if you want to retain more moisture and heat during baking. However, a simple pie plate works great for many casserole recipes. Just remember to cool it off a bit before serving for your safety.
