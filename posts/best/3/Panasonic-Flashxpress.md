The Panasonic 2-in-1 Compact Microwave Oven with FlashXpress Broiler (NN-GN68KS) is an impressive product that combines the power of a microwave and a broiler into one small, easy-to-use appliance. As a reviewer who has used this product daily, I've grown to appreciate its versatility and convenience. One of the coolest features is the flashXpress broiler, which allows you to create warm and crispy snacks and meals right in your microwave. It's not just about grilled cheese or burgers either; I've experimented with everything from chicken tenders to leftovers, and the results have been impressive. 

The compact size of the NN-GN68KS is another huge plus. I've found that it takes up minimal counter space and is a perfect size for smaller kitchens. The stainless steel exterior is a nice touch too, not only does it look sleek and modern, but it's also easy to clean when those inevitable spills occur. 

However, there have been a few minor drawbacks to my experience with this product. For one, the number of buttons can be a bit overwhelming at times. It took me a while to figure out which option was best for what I was trying to cook or heat, but with some trial and error, I eventually found what worked best for me. 

Another small issue was the lack of a 30-second quick cook button, which was a feature I had grown used to on previous microwaves. It took a little extra time to get used to, but once I did, it wasn't too big of a deal. 

Overall, the Panasonic NN-GN68KS has been a reliable and efficient addition to my daily life. The combination of a microwave and a broiler in one compact appliance has made mealtime much easier and convenient, and the flashXpress broiler feature has allowed me to explore new ways of cooking. While there were a few minor drawbacks, the pros far outweigh the cons.
