### [High Visibility Hoodie for Safety](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Safety+Wear?utm\_term=high-visibility-hoodie-for-safety)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Safety+Wear?utm_term=high-visibility-hoodie-for-safety"><img alt="safetyshirtz-01010303xxl-basic-high-visibility-hoodie-royal-blue-2xl-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/safetyshirtz-01010303xxl-basic-high-visibility-hoodie-royal-blue-2xl-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Recently, I had the chance to try on the SafetyShirtz Basic High Visibility Hoodie in a royal blue, 2XL size. The first thing that caught my eye was how similar the front and back print designs were. It's a nice touch, ensuring that people can see you from any angle. 

Another feature I appreciated was the front pouch pocket. It's perfect for holding small essentials like a phone or keys while you're on the go. The preshrunk fabric also made me feel confident that it would maintain its shape even after multiple washes. 

However, bear in mind that this hoodie does tend to run slightly small, so be sure to size up if you're unsure. The 8oz. 50/50 cotton/DryBlend poly blend and no-pill Air Jet Yarn also worked well to provide comfortable wear. 

The fact that the SafetyShirtz hoodie is designed and printed in the USA adds an extra layer of trust and pride. I've received a lot of compliments on my new hoodie and have found it to be an excellent choice for safety wear.

### [Men's Waterproof High Visibility ANSI Class 3 Bomber Safety Jacket](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Safety+Wear?utm\_term=mens-waterproof-high-visibility-ansi-class-3-bomber-safety-jacket)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Safety+Wear?utm_term=mens-waterproof-high-visibility-ansi-class-3-bomber-safety-jacket"><img alt="mens-ansi-class-3-high-visibility-bomber-safety-jacket-waterproof-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mens-ansi-class-3-high-visibility-bomber-safety-jacket-waterproof-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The vibrant, reflective taping on the front, back, and arms makes me feel like I'm glowing in the dark, ensuring I'm seen by drivers and coworkers alike. 

One feature that sets this jacket apart is the molded adjustable cuffs with hook and loop closures. They perfectly fit my wrists, keeping out the chilly wind and ensuring I stay warm while on the go. Plus, the clear ID pocket is a thoughtful addition, allowing me to easily display my ID without compromising the jacket's waterproofness. 

However, there were a few cons to consider. The coat is a bit bulkier than I initially expected, making it more of an overcoat than a lightweight jacket. While this isn't a deal-breaker for me, it might be something to consider for those looking for a more versatile piece. 

Another downside was the durability of the jacket. Within just a few months, the seam where the sleeves zip off began to rip, which was disappointing given the coat's otherwise high-quality construction. 

Overall, the Men's ANSI Class 3 High Visibility Bomber Safety Jacket is a solid choice for those in need of a reliable, high-visibility workwear option. Just remember to keep an eye on the durability, and you'll be good to go.

One of the standout features for me has been the hand warmer pockets. On colder days, these pockets have made a significant difference in keeping my hands cozy and comfortable. Additionally, the rib-knit cuffs and waistband have provided a snug yet breathable fit, preventing any unpleasant breezes from slipping in. 

As a bonus, the secure chest pocket has been incredibly useful for holding essentials like my phone and keys. Although it's been designed to withstand various weather conditions, I have noticed that the plastic zipper may not be the most durable component of the jacket. Despite this minor shortcoming, I'm still very happy with the overall quality and performance of the Hi-Vis ANSI II Mesh-Lined Safety Jacket.
