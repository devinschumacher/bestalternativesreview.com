### [Roland GO:PIANO - Portable Keyboard with Alexa Built-In](https://serp.ly/amazon/Roland+Go+Keys?utm\_term=roland-go-piano-portable-keyboard-with-alexa-built-in)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Roland+Go+Keys?utm_term=roland-go-piano-portable-keyboard-with-alexa-built-in"><img alt="roland-go-piano-61-key-portable-keyboard-with-alexa-built-in-194744667863" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/roland-go-piano-61-key-portable-keyboard-with-alexa-built-in-194744667863/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Roland GO: PIANO 61-Key Portable Keyboard was recently added to my daily musical routine, and I must say, it's been quite a game-changer. As a beginner, the compact yet premium look of this instrument caught my attention, and I couldn't wait to give it a try. Being able to play anywhere at home is a feature I really appreciate. 

The authentic touch response of the 61-key keyboard was also noticeable, as it made playing more enjoyable and engaging. The inclusion of various sound options, from electric pianos to organs, allowed me to explore a variety of styles. 

One of the standout features of this portable keyboard is the built-in speakers and support for Bluetooth audio/MIDI, which enabled me to connect with my smartphone and tablet seamlessly. 

Although you can play anywhere with this instrument, my favorite part of the GO: PIANO is its integration with Alexa. I had no idea I could operate nearly every onboard control using just my voice, making the experience even easier and more practical. Ask Alexa to turn the metronome on or off, change the beat, record your performance, or even queue up your favorite songs from Amazon Music - the possibilities are endless. 

Having the option to save recordings in the cloud is an added bonus that came as a pleasant surprise. However, I must admit, I found the keys to be somewhat hard to press compared to my Roland FP-30, which meant the go-keys didn't feel as smooth under my fingers. 

Despite this minor issue, the Roland GO: PIANO with Alexa Built-In has been an exciting, user-friendly addition to my daily life as a beginner pianist. The combination of smart features and premium sound quality makes it an excellent choice for anyone looking to improve their musical skills with a portable and versatile keyboard.
