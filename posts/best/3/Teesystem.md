I recently tried out the Pride PTS Step-tee 3 1/4" 50/Pack tees, and I must say, they have been a game-changer in my golfing experience. The tees are color-coded which made it easy for me to select the right one for the appropriate club and tee height.

But overall, I would definitely recommend these tees to anyone looking for a convenient and effective way to improve their golf game. The benefits far outweigh the drawback, and I'm confident they'll make a positive difference in your game too.

Despite this, the overall quality of the tees didn't seem to impact their performance too much. 

In conclusion, the Pride Professional Tee System ProLength Max Tee, at roughly $1.75 per bag, provided great value for me as it consistently improved the quality of my shots. While the durability of these tees could be better, the unique features and affordable price have definitely made them a staple in my golf equipment.
