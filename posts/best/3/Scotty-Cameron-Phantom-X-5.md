I recently got my hands on the Scotty Cameron 2022 Phantom x 9.5 Putter, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer on the green. The 35-inch Phantom x 9.5 Putter, with its 3.5-degree lie angle, has taken my short game to new heights. 

One of the standout features is the solid stainless steel face and wings, which provide a terrific balance and feel. The precision milled 303 stainless steel body, combined with an aluminum sole and stainless steel counterweights, offers unmatched stability and improved confidence. 

The clean top line, paired with the one-piece milled line of sight in grey, makes aligning with the ball a breeze. The inclined jet neck is a welcome addition, as it ensures an unobstructed view of the ball for optimum focus during play. 

The only criticism I have is regarding the 3/4 shaft weights - it might take some time to get used to. However, the benefits far outweigh this minor inconvenience. Overall, the Scotty Cameron 2022 Phantom x 9.5 Putter is a must-have for golf enthusiasts looking to level up their game.

The solid face technology also made a difference in the solid feedback and softer feel of the putter. 

Another highlight for me was the custom-designed grip. The Pistolero Plus grip made it easier to hold and gave me the perfect feel, especially when it came to aligning with the sweet spot.
