Got tired of my gear getting soaked by rain or battered by the sun while I was on the road? That's when I found out about the DNA Motoring Truck Bed Top Hard Solid Tri-Fold Tonneau Cover. I installed this bad boy on my 2019+ Ram 1500 6.5' Fleetside Bed Without RamBox and let me tell you, it made a world of difference. 

The cover has a unique tri-fold design that lets me have the comfort of a soft cover with the security of a hard one. It's super easy to install and remove, which saves a lot of time and effort. The best part? It never slows me down during my daily hauls. I can have one panel open or access my entire bed - this cover is always ready for the job. 

The fact that it's tailored to the truck's specifications makes it a perfect fit and adds an elegant touch to the truck's exterior with that bump texture. However, I did notice that sometimes the cover makes a little bit of noise when I'm driving, which takes a bit away from my peaceful ride. Overall, it's a solid purchase and a game-changer in keeping my gear safe.

I recently had the opportunity to try out the Mopar Accessories Bed Side Rail for a 2011 Dodge Ram 1500. As a truck owner, I was looking for something to add some style and functionality to my ride.

Overall, this product was a great addition to my Ram 1500, providing both style and practicality. It was relatively easy to install and fit like a glove. However, one downside is that the bed side rail is only compatible with 2011 models, so those with newer or older versions might need to look elsewhere.

### [BuiltRight Industries 5th Gen RAM 1500 Bedside Rack System - 4pc Set](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Ram+1500+Accessories?utm\_term=builtright-industries-5th-gen-ram-1500-bedside-rack-system-4pc-set)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Ram+1500+Accessories?utm_term=builtright-industries-5th-gen-ram-1500-bedside-rack-system-4pc-set"><img alt="builtright-industries-102501-2019-ram-1500-5-7ft-bed-full-bedside-rack-4pc-set-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/builtright-industries-102501-2019-ram-1500-5-7ft-bed-full-bedside-rack-4pc-set-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Imagine you're cruising down the highway in your trusty RAM 1500, ready to tackle any job that comes your way. Suddenly, you spot an opportunity to streamline your work life - a full bedside rack right from BuiltRight Industries. This rack isn't just any old piece of hardware, it's a meticulously crafted, sturdy beast that will let you keep your gear organized, easily accessible, and secure. And best of all? It's US-made, and backed by a patent that ensures its durability and quality. 

First things first, the rack system installs using the same factory mounting points that your truck already has. This means no messy modifications, no fancy tricks - just a simple, secure fit. Plus, you get four-panel coverage for all the gear you might need to carry, from tools and straps to larger items. The rack system even works seamlessly with MOLLE/PALS accessories for countless storage configurations. 

With a black texture powdercoat for corrosion resistance and CNC technology for the perfect fit, you can be confident that your rack will withstand the test of time and the road ahead. And with its 11ga steel construction, there's no need to worry about your gear toppling over or falling out of place. 

But let's not sugarcoat it, this isn't a perfect product. For starters, the holes for the utility rails might not be in the exact same place for all trucks, causing some potential fitment issues. Additionally, the product comes without spacers, which can be a bit of a bummer, but BuiltRight was quick to send them out once the issue was reported. 

All things considered, if you're in the market for a robust, reliable, and easily configurable rack to organize your truck's cargo, you can't go wrong with BuiltRight Industries' full bedside rack system.

Regrettably, this product didn't seem to work for everyone, as seen in some user reviews. Therefore, it is essential to double-check the compatibility before making a purchase. Overall, the Kojem Under Seat Storage Box delivered a spacious and convenient storage solution for those looking to enjoy a clutter-free car and truck experience. 


### [Off-Road Style Running Boards for Quad Cab Ram 1500 2019-2024](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Ram+1500+Accessories?utm\_term=off-road-style-running-boards-for-quad-cab-ram-1500-2019-2024)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Ram+1500+Accessories?utm_term=off-road-style-running-boards-for-quad-cab-ram-1500-2019-2024"><img alt="off-road-style-running-boards-quad-cab-82215514ab-ram-1500-2019-2024-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/off-road-style-running-boards-quad-cab-82215514ab-ram-1500-2019-2024-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The molded aspect of these running boards really sets them apart. They perfectly fit my truck, with the same level of craftsmanship as the original production. The high-quality materials used not only ensure a perfect fit but also provide a durable finish that withstands daily use. The correct colors match the OEM finish perfectly, while the original equipment finish adds a touch of class to the overall look of my Ram 1500. 

However, there was one aspect that I found a bit disappointing. These running boards don't seem to be very sturdy compared to others on the market. I noticed some flex in the steps when stepping on them, which could be a concern for heavier users or those who need to navigate uneven terrain. 

In conclusion, the Off-Road Style Running Boards bring a stylish touch to my Quad Cab Ram 1500 while offering a comfortable and durable stepping solution. However, their lack of sturdiness might be a drawback for those seeking a more robust option.

I recently added these sleek black running boards to my Dodge Ram 1500, and I'm in love with the stylish update they bring to my truck. Made of rust-resistant steel with a durable textured black powder coating, they not only protect my vehicle from any low-body damage but also provide an easier and safer entry point for passengers. 

What stood out in my experience is the no-drilling installation process - these things bolt right onto the factory mounting points, making installation a breeze. However, I did notice that the mounting hardware could have been more comprehensive. The mounting hardware that came with the product was only enough for one set of hex nuts and lock washers, which made me worry if they would hold up well long-term. 

Despite that minor inconvenience, these running boards have been a great addition to my vehicle, and I'm happy with my purchase. If you're looking to give your Dodge Ram 1500 a chic style update, these running boards might be just what you need.
