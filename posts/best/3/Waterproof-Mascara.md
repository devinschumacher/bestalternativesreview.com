### [Jargod Waterproof 4D Silk Fiber Eyelash Mascara](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara?utm\_term=jargod-waterproof-4d-silk-fiber-eyelash-mascara)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara?utm_term=jargod-waterproof-4d-silk-fiber-eyelash-mascara"><img alt="jargod-4d-silk-fiber-eyelash-mascara-waterproof-long-lasting-eye-lashes-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/jargod-4d-silk-fiber-eyelash-mascara-waterproof-long-lasting-eye-lashes-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The 4D Mascara comes with a waterproof/water-resistant label and a net weight of 0.46oz. Despite being a budget product, it packs a powerful punch with impressive results that have earned it a 4.7-star rating from satisfied customers. 


### [Mascara Volume Effet Faux Cils Waterproof - Charcoal Black](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara?utm\_term=mascara-volume-effet-faux-cils-waterproof-charcoal-black)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara?utm_term=mascara-volume-effet-faux-cils-waterproof-charcoal-black"><img alt="mascara-volume-effet-faux-cils-waterproof-01-charcoal-black-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mascara-volume-effet-faux-cils-waterproof-01-charcoal-black-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a fan of eyelashes that stand out without looking too heavy, Yves Saint Laurent's Volume Effet Waterproof Mascara came as a breath of fresh air into my life. 

The color I use, Charcoal Black, gives my lashes a glamorous edge that makes them look bolder with each day â€“ a feature that was missing from my previous picks which, to be frank, lacked the depth and volume. This mascara effortlessly gives my lashes a lift, as if nature gave my eyes a few more inches to play with. 

If you're a regular reader of beauty blogs or a magazine fanatic like myself, waterproof mascaras might be nothing new. But this one stands out in terms of its efficiency. It manages to maintain that perfect black while staying unaffected by any water or tear that makes its way onto my lids, which is almost a miracle itself I must say. 

My only gripe might be the wand. It's an interesting shape, for sure, but navigating through the lashes can sometimes feel like a bit of an ordeal, especially for those with sparse or delicate lashes. I've needed a little more patience to get the application just right, but once mastered, it produces the perfect blend of volume and curl. 

All in all, the Waterproof Mascara by Yves Saint Laurent is a luxury I wouldn't mind spending on every paycheck. It lends a sophisticated edge that makes your lash line pop and is well worth the splurge. And after all, isn't the key to beauty investing in the right tools?

### [Revlon Waterproof So Fierce Mascara for a Bold Look](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara?utm\_term=revlon-waterproof-so-fierce-mascara-for-a-bold-look)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara?utm_term=revlon-waterproof-so-fierce-mascara-for-a-bold-look"><img alt="revlon-so-fierce-eyes-wide-open-mascara-waterproof-black-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/revlon-so-fierce-eyes-wide-open-mascara-waterproof-black-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try the Revlon So Fierce! Eyes Wide Open mascara, and I was pretty excited to see what it was all about. As a mascara lover, I'm always on the lookout for new products that can make my lashes look longer, fuller, and more defined. 

One of the first things I noticed about this mascara was its unique wand, which has a curved design that's specifically designed to lift and shape every lash. The six product reservoirs in the wand are thoughtfully designed to ensure that the formula coats and thickens each lash from root to tip, giving you a complete look. 

What really stood out to me was the innovative LiftLash formula that the mascara boasts. It promises to deliver weightless texture and maximum volume to your lashes, and I have to say, it did not disappoint. Within just a few coats, my lashes looked noticeably lifted and volumized, and I received multiple compliments throughout the day. 

Another highlight of this mascara is its longwear formula, which promises up to 24 hours of wear. While I didn't keep my make-up on for the full 24 hours, I was impressed with how well this mascara held up throughout the day. It didn't smudge or flake, and even after several hours, my lashes still looked just as good as they did when I first applied the mascara. 

One downside I did notice was that the mascara can be a bit challenging to remove at the end of the day. I found that it required a bit more effort to completely remove the mascara from my lashes, but I can see that this is likely due to the longwear formula. 

Overall, I was pretty pleased with the results I got from using the Revlon So Fierce! Eyes Wide Open mascara. It's definitely a product that I'd recommend for anyone looking to enhance their lashes and create a bold, eye-catching look. 


### [Classic & Waterproof Lengthening Mascara Duo by Laura Geller](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara?utm\_term=classic-waterproof-lengthening-mascara-duo-by-laura-geller)

As a beauty enthusiast, I recently tried out the Laura Geller Always There Lengthening Mascara Classic + Waterproof Duo. The set comes with a classic regular mascara and a waterproof version, making it the perfect companion for any day. 

What struck me the most about this mascara is its long-wearing, ultra-creamy formula that immediately builds and lengthens lashes. The brush shape is another standout feature, with soft and wavy fibers delivering the perfect amount of pigment with just one stroke. It coats each lash evenly without clumping, ensuring a natural yet enhanced look. 

One of the things I appreciated the most about this mascara is its gentle formula. As someone with sensitive eyes, I'm always cautious when trying new mascaras. However, this one caused no irritation or sensitivity at all. I could wear it all day without any discomfort, which is a huge plus. 

Another excellent feature is the mascara's promise of no clumping, even after multiple coats. My lashes remained separated and defined throughout the day, giving them a more natural and defined appearance. 

Overall, the Laura Geller Always There Lengthening Mascara Classic + Waterproof Duo is a reliable and high-quality product that delivers stunning results without fuss. I highly recommend giving it a try if you're in search of a reliable mascara for daily use. 


### [Kill Lash Superproof Mascara - Sweat-Resistant Curling Brush for Curls, Length, and Volume](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara?utm\_term=kill-lash-superproof-mascara-sweat-resistant-curling-brush-for-curls-length-and-volume)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara?utm_term=kill-lash-superproof-mascara-sweat-resistant-curling-brush-for-curls-length-and-volume"><img alt="clio-kill-lash-superproof-mascara-02-volume-curling-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/clio-kill-lash-superproof-mascara-02-volume-curling-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently gave the Clio Kill Lash Superproof Mascara a try, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations. The mascara's water-resistant formula kept my lashes from smudging and held them curled throughout the day. The unique brush applicator made application a breeze, and I was thrilled with the volume and length it provided in just one swipe. 

However, one downside was that the mascara was a bit challenging to remove at the end of the day. It required some extra effort and time to ensure it was completely gone. Despite this minor inconvenience, overall, I found the Clio Kill Lash Superproof Mascara to be a solid choice for those seeking a smudge-proof, waterproof option that delivers on its promises. 


### [Maybelline Volum' Express The Falsies Waterproof Mascara - Builds 8X More Volume](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara?utm\_term=maybelline-volum-express-the-falsies-waterproof-mascara-builds-8x-more-volume)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara?utm_term=maybelline-volum-express-the-falsies-waterproof-mascara-builds-8x-more-volume"><img alt="maybelline-volum-express-the-falsies-waterproof-mascara-very-black-0-25-fl-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/maybelline-volum-express-the-falsies-waterproof-mascara-very-black-0-25-fl-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Maybelline Volum' Express The Falsies Waterproof Mascara is a fantastic addition to any makeup routine. The unique combination of a flexible wand and a patented spoon brush combined with the Kera-Fiber formula delivers 8 times more volume to your lashes, creating the appearance of falsies. 

This waterproof formula is perfect for those on-the-go days, and it's suitable for contact lens wearers, making it a must-have for sensitive eyes. While the mascara does require a bit of practice to avoid clumping, the payoff of having a bold look with minimal effort is well worth it. Overall, I highly recommend giving this mascara a try. 


### [Maybelline Volum' Express Pumped Up Colossal Waterproof Mascara](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara?utm\_term=maybelline-volum-express-pumped-up-colossal-waterproof-mascara)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara?utm_term=maybelline-volum-express-pumped-up-colossal-waterproof-mascara"><img alt="maybelline-volum-express-pumped-up-colossal-waterproof-mascara-classic-black-0-32-fl-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/maybelline-volum-express-pumped-up-colossal-waterproof-mascara-classic-black-0-32-fl-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I had been using the classic black version of Maybelline's Volum' Express Pumped Up Colossal Waterproof Mascara for quite some time and I must say, I'm a fan. The mascara brush is big and bold, filling my lashes with volume and providing a pumped-up look. I particularly love the double collagen formula, which enhances the natural beauty of my lashes, making them look fuller and longer. Moreover, the waterproof feature is a game-changer for me since it doesn't smudge or run after a few hours of wearing, even during a long workday. 

However, there are a few drawbacks to this mascara. It tends to get a bit clumpy, which can be a hassle to remove. Also, some users may not appreciate the drying nature of the formula, as it can be slightly difficult to apply due to its quick-drying nature. Overall, the benefits of this mascara definitely outweigh the cons for me, and I'll continue to use it in my daily makeup routine. 


### [Masterpiece Waterproof Mascara by Max Factor - Intense Eyelash Definition and Volume](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara?utm\_term=masterpiece-waterproof-mascara-by-max-factor-intense-eyelash-definition-and-volume)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara?utm_term=masterpiece-waterproof-mascara-by-max-factor-intense-eyelash-definition-and-volume"><img alt="max-factor-masterpiece-waterproof-mascara-black-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/max-factor-masterpiece-waterproof-mascara-black-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently gave Max Factor's Masterpiece Waterproof Mascara a try, and I have to say, I'm impressed! This high-tech mascara uses an IFX brush to evenly coat my lashes, giving them a remarkable boost in both volume and length. One of the standout features for me was the ability of the brush to reach even the smallest lashes in the corners of my eyes, making my eyes truly pop. 

The waterproof formula is a game-changer, providing lash confidence whatever the weather, although I do appreciate the fact that it's gentle on sensitive eyes and suitable for contact lens wearers. The product's consistency makes it easy to remove at the end of the day without any discomfort. 

While the mascara delivers fantastic results, I should mention that it's essential to avoid pumping the brush into the bottle to prevent air from entering and drying out the mascara faster. 

Overall, I found that this Max Factor mascara exceeded my expectations and I highly recommend it for those looking for a high-quality, waterproof option that doesn't cause eye irritation or clump up. Give it a try - your lashes will thank you! 


### [Rimmel Scandaleyes Waterproof Mascara: Bold, Volume, and Long-Lasting](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara?utm\_term=rimmel-scandaleyes-waterproof-mascara-bold-volume-and-long-lasting)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara?utm_term=rimmel-scandaleyes-waterproof-mascara-bold-volume-and-long-lasting"><img alt="rimmel-scandaleyes-retro-glam-mascara-waterproof-volume-black-001-0-41-fl-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rimmel-scandaleyes-retro-glam-mascara-waterproof-volume-black-001-0-41-fl-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried the Rimmel Scandaleyes Retro Glam Mascara, and it exceeded my expectations. This mascara provides a bold, wide-eyed false lash look that I haven't been able to achieve with many other products. The exclusive hour-glass brush shapes to the lash line, plumping and fanning lashes for a big, false lash look in just one simple stroke. 

I found that the formula is enriched with conditioning elements, allowing for a smooth application and long-lasting wear. The waterproof property is a great feature, as it helps the mascara stay put even during sweaty, long work days. However, it is essential to treat the applicator with the same sanitary care as your eyes and to close the cap tightly after each use. 

One thing I noticed is that the brush isn't the highest quality, as it doesn't help separate the lashes. But overall, the Rimmel Scandaleyes Retro Glam Mascara is a great everyday product for those seeking a volumized, full-fan effect without the need for fake eye lashes. 


### [Waterproof L'Oreal Paris Air Volume Mega Mascara for Stunning Volume and Weightless Lashes](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara?utm\_term=waterproof-loreal-paris-air-volume-mega-mascara-for-stunning-volume-and-weightless-lashes)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara?utm_term=waterproof-loreal-paris-air-volume-mega-mascara-for-stunning-volume-and-weightless-lashes"><img alt="loreal-paris-air-volume-mega-mascara-waterproof-black-854-0-28-fl-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/loreal-paris-air-volume-mega-mascara-waterproof-black-854-0-28-fl-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Imagine walking into the room ready for a night of fun, only to be met with a set of lashes that scream volume. That's the story of L'Oreal Paris Air Volume Mega Mascara, a waterproof mascara that adds a whole new dimension to your lashes. 

From the moment I held it, I could feel the product's weightless feel, that of a light hot air balloon. The waterproof formula is air whipped, allowing for a lash multiplying effect that felt as light as a feather on my lashes. But that's not all, the formula is truly waterproof, clinging on even at the bottom lashes, the ones that tend to stick to your face. 

The application was a breeze with the double-bristle brush. It's not just any brush, it's high charge and cushiony, coating every lash from root to tip for full and thick lashes. The short bristles caught and loaded lashes deeply at the roots while the longer ones evenly dispensed the formula for a fully blown out look. 

However, the first big drawback appeared during removal. The claim that it can be removed with warm water seems like a sales pitch because my lashes were left as stubborn as ever. I had to dig deep and use a good eye makeup remover to get it off. 

The mascara seemed to work well on the initial application, but as the day progressed, the eyelashes started to flake. Also, it didn't hold a curl even after a good lash perm. The brush was a disappointment, it often ended up on my eyelids rather than my lashes, making the product a bit of a mess. 

In conclusion, while it lives up to its promise of volume and the lightweight feel is definitely a plus, the removal process and flaking issues are a bit of a letdown. I'm glad to have a new trick up my sleeve for those nights when lashes need a boost, but it's definitely not the perfect mascara. 


### [Wet N Wild Mega Length Waterproof Very Black Mascara](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara?utm\_term=wet-n-wild-mega-length-waterproof-very-black-mascara)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara?utm_term=wet-n-wild-mega-length-waterproof-very-black-mascara"><img alt="wet-n-wild-mega-length-waterproof-mascara-very-black-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/wet-n-wild-mega-length-waterproof-mascara-very-black-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer, I've had mixed experiences with Wet N Wild Mega Length Waterproof Mascara - Very Black. I initially enjoyed the precision comb brush and found that the formula allowed for a quick, easy application. The pigmentation was excellent, giving my lashes a noticeable boost in length. 

However, there were some downsides. First, I noticed that the mascara wore off too quickly, leaving my lashes looking dull and clumpy within a few hours. The formula was also hard to remove, which caused some irritation and discomfort. Additionally, the mascara seemed to smudge and flake easily, which was an issue for me, especially while working out or in humid environments. 

Overall, I believe the Wet N Wild Mega Length Waterproof Mascara - Very Black has its pros and cons. If you prioritize waterproof, smudge-proof formulas and are on a budget, this mascara might be worth a try. However, if you're looking for a long-lasting, easy-to-remove mascara that doesn't smudge or flake, there might be better options available. 


### [L'Oreal Paris Waterproof Collagen Mascara - Smudge-Free, Easy Application, Full Volume 7x Impact](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara?utm\_term=loreal-paris-waterproof-collagen-mascara-smudge-free-easy-application-full-volume-7x-impact)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara?utm_term=loreal-paris-waterproof-collagen-mascara-smudge-free-easy-application-full-volume-7x-impact"><img alt="loreal-paris-extra-volume-collagen-waterproof-mascara-blackest-black-695-0-34-fl-oz-tube-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/loreal-paris-extra-volume-collagen-waterproof-mascara-blackest-black-695-0-34-fl-oz-tube-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a long-time user of this L'oreal Paris Extra-Volume Collagen Waterproof Mascara in Blackest Black, I've got to say it has become my go-to for full lashes when I need them. I've tried other mascaras in the past, but none can quite compare to this one. The Hydra-Collagen Complex waterproof formula is what makes it stand out. It clings to my lashes without smudging or flaking, and the oversized bristle brush ensures that every single lash is covered. 

Some users might find it a bit difficult to use at first, but once you get the hang of it, you'll love the results. The Lash-plumping Technology ensures that my lashes look thicker and fuller, without any clumps. I particularly appreciate the fact that it's suitable for sensitive eyes and contact lens wearers. 

However, there is one aspect of this mascara that could be improved - the longevity of the product. As mentioned in the product description, it only lasts for 6 months once opened. I wish it could be a bit more durable. But overall, I'm very happy with my choice of this L'oreal Paris Extra-Volume Collagen Waterproof Mascara in Blackest Black. 


### [Almay All the Benefits Waterproof Mascara for Voluminous Lashes](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara?utm\_term=almay-all-the-benefits-waterproof-mascara-for-voluminous-lashes)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara?utm_term=almay-all-the-benefits-waterproof-mascara-for-voluminous-lashes"><img alt="almay-all-the-benefits-mascara-multi-benefit-waterproof-black-504-0-24-fl-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/almay-all-the-benefits-mascara-multi-benefit-waterproof-black-504-0-24-fl-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried Almay's Mascara, and I must say, it left me with mixed feelings. On the bright side, the product had a smooth and velvety texture, and the brush glided on without any clumps or uneven application. The color was deep and pigmented, making my lashes look darker and fuller. 

However, the downside was that the mascara seemed to dry out pretty quickly. I noticed it started flaking along my lashes after just a few days of use, leaving me with unwanted clumps and a messy appearance. 

Additionally, I found it quite difficult to remove the product, despite it being waterproof. It took a lot of effort and a specific makeup remover, leaving me with irritated lash lines. 

Overall, the Almay Mascara had some good aspects, but the fast-drying formula and the struggle to remove it from my lashes really put me off. I can't say I'll be reaching for this product again any time soon. 


### [Eyeko Waterproof Beach Mascara](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara?utm\_term=eyeko-waterproof-beach-mascara)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara?utm_term=eyeko-waterproof-beach-mascara"><img alt="eyeko-beach-waterproof-mascara-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/eyeko-beach-waterproof-mascara-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Experience beach-inspired elegance with the Eyeko Waterproof Mascara, which boasts gorgeously full lashes that stand up to life's adventures. This mascara's volumizing formula effortlessly transitions between a natural look and a bold, eye-catching statement. 

The groundbreaking wave brush captures each lash and applies a luxuriously black, non-clumpy formula, ensuring lasting volume throughout the day. Eyeko's unique mascara is enriched with nourishing Coconut Oil, promoting healthy lashes and growth. 

Designed for use on straight lashes, this mascara helps maintain the curl, even in the most challenging hair types. Although the waterproof formula may necessitate a specially formulated remover for complete removal, its durability and extended wear have garnered rave reviews from users. 


### [Maybelline Volum Express Colossal Waterproof Mascara: 36-Hour Dramatic Lashes for Lasting Volume and Color](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara?utm\_term=maybelline-volum-express-colossal-waterproof-mascara-36-hour-dramatic-lashes-for-lasting-volume-and-color)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara?utm_term=maybelline-volum-express-colossal-waterproof-mascara-36-hour-dramatic-lashes-for-lasting-volume-and-color"><img alt="maybelline-volum-express-colossal-waterproof-mascara-very-black-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/maybelline-volum-express-colossal-waterproof-mascara-very-black-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Recently, I decided to give Maybelline Colossal 36 Hour Longwear Mascara - Very Black a try in my daily makeup routine. I had heard great things about this mascara and wanted to see if it could live up to the hype. 

To my delight, the first time I applied it, I noticed an immediate difference in the volume of my lashes. The mascara's smudge-resistant and flake-resistant formula ensured that my lashes looked thicker and more voluminous than ever before. The waterproof formula also made it a great choice for those of us who live in areas with high humidity. 

However, as I wore the mascara for longer periods, I noticed a bit of discomfort in my eyes from the product. This discomfort was not present initially, but as the day went on, it became quite noticeable. I'm not certain if this is due to the mascara's ingredients or if it's a reaction I have to the product. 

In conclusion, Maybelline Colossal 36 Hour Longwear Mascara - Very Black is an excellent choice for those looking for a product that can provide their lashes with a boost. Its smudge-resistant, flake-resistant, and waterproof properties make it a standout option in the world of mascaras. However, it's worth considering the potential for eye irritation if you plan on wearing it for extended periods.

The mascara boasts a thixotropic gel form for a precise and effortless application, ensuring every lash is grabbed and curled to perfection. The waterproof nature of the mascara also makes it a reliable friend for your poolside or beach activities, ensuring your lashes remain fabulous no matter the weather. 

However, if you're looking for a more dramatic or natural look, this mascara might not be your cup of tea. Some reviewers have mentioned that while it works well to define lashes and provide length, it lacks the volume needed for a dramatic look.

When I first started using L'Oreal Voluminous Waterproof Mascara, I was instantly impressed by its application process. The special brush separates every lash and evenly coats them with the mascara. The result was a natural-looking, fuller set of lashes that made them appear more dramatic and volumized. I loved the feeling of the mascara on my lashes as they were smooth and didn't irritate my eyes or cause any flaking. 

One of the key features that stood out was the mascara's waterproof formula that made it suitable for all-day wear without smudging or smearing. As I tried it out in different activities like working out, jumping in the pool, or getting caught in the rain, the product stayed true to its claim and did not budge. 

However, there were a few minor drawbacks. Although the mascara resisted flaking, it did occasionally need a gentle touch with the brush to prevent any clumps from forming. Also, on a few occasions, I experienced slight irritation around my eyes, but this was resolved by using gentle makeup removers and taking care not to rub too hard. 

Overall, my experience with the L'Oreal Voluminous Waterproof Mascara has been nothing but positive. It delivered on its promises of volume, length, and water resistance while still being gentle on my skin. I can confidently say that this mascara has earned a permanent spot in my makeup routine.

This mascara transforms my eyelashes with its volumizing and lengthening powers. I appreciate the formula that delivers five major benefits: volume, length, definition, lift, and intense color. The mini oval shape of the brush makes it easier to apply, reaching each and every lash. However, I've noticed that the formula can sometimes be a bit lumpy, making application a bit difficult. 

One of the standout features of this mascara is its waterproof formula. It's perfect for pool days and humid weather, but sometimes it can be a bit challenging to remove at the end of the day. Apart from that, I've also experienced some minor clumping. 

Despite these small drawbacks, this Revlon mascara has become my go-to product for everyday wear. The high-quality pigment and the mascara's ability to hold a curl have definitely made a difference in the way my eyes are defined. I would highly recommend this product, but remember to be gentle while removing it to avoid any potential discomfort.

Oh, my lash fringe! I recently tried this L'Oreal voluminous X Fiber mascara, and let me tell you, it was quite the experience. This waterproof mascara is a two-step treasure, consisting of a black primer followed by the fiber-infused mascara.

All in all, the L'Oreal voluminous X Fiber mascara has its pros and cons. While it delivers on the promise of an extreme lash fringe, it's a bit of a battle to keep the smudging at bay. That being said, I wouldn't say no to more drama in my lashes, even if I need to employ a few extra makeup removal tricks.

Another minor drawback was the smell, which was quite strong and had a chemical undertone. Although it's made of nourishing vegan waxes, it was a little overwhelming for me and my senses. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the Rise Waterproof Mascara for its remarkable performance in lengthening and lifting my lashes without clumping or flaking. Plus, the added bonuses of it being waterproof and gentle on my lashes make it a top pick for my daily makeup routine.

One downside I found was that the mascara seemed to dry out quickly, which made it a bit tougher to apply in the later coats. Additionally, the mascara's waterproof formula did make it a bit more challenging to remove at the end of the day, but Neutrogena's Oil-Free Makeup Remover did the trick. 

Overall, I enjoyed using Neutrogena's Healthy Volume Waterproof Mascara and appreciated its gentle approach to lash care. I would definitely recommend it to others looking for a reliable, long-lasting mascara with a natural-looking finish. 


### [L'Oreal Paris Voluminous Super Star Mascara - Show-Stopping Smudge-Free Lashes for Sensitive Eyes](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara?utm\_term=loreal-paris-voluminous-super-star-mascara-show-stopping-smudge-free-lashes-for-sensitive-eyes)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara?utm_term=loreal-paris-voluminous-super-star-mascara-show-stopping-smudge-free-lashes-for-sensitive-eyes"><img alt="loreal-voluminous-super-star-mascara-waterproof-blackest-black-624-0-4-fl-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/loreal-voluminous-super-star-mascara-waterproof-blackest-black-624-0-4-fl-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to give L'Oreal Paris Voluminous Superstar Mascara a try, and I have to say, it was quite the experience. The product comes with a built-in primer and mascara, which I found to be quite convenient. The 2-step system definitely helped me achieve the super volumized lashes I was looking for. 

However, there were a couple of things that I wasn't so happy with. The smudge-proof formula wasn't as effective as I would have liked. I found that the mascara would rub off under my eyes after a few hours of wear, leaving me with some unintentional raccoon-like eyes. I also had a bit of trouble applying the mascara evenly at first, as the primer needed to dry before I could apply the fiber-rich mascara. 

Overall, I think the L'Oreal Voluminous Superstar Mascara is a nice product to have in your makeup collection, especially if you're looking for a waterproof option that can give your lashes some extra volume. Just keep in mind that it may not be the most smudge-proof formula and might require some practice to get the hang of the application process.

The effect of the mascara was truly astounding - my lashes appeared significantly longer than they were ever before. The waterproof formula held the length and separation all day long, without smudging or flaking. 

While I was initially hooked on the product, I did notice a couple drawbacks. Firstly, removing it was quite the challenge. I ended up needing an oil-based makeup remover for it to fully come off my lashes. Secondly, the brush seemed to transfer some product onto my upper eyelids, creating the need for additional clean-up. Another downside was the potential for the product to dry out quickly, especially once it was exposed to air, which could affect the quality and performance of the mascara.

If you're looking for a mascara that provides impressive length, separation, and can last you all day, this might be the perfect fit. But if you are sensitive to products and prefer a mascara that is easy to remove and maintain, you might need to look elsewhere.

## FAQ

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Waterproof-Mascara-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Waterproof-Mascara-4" height="540"></a></div>


### What is waterproof mascara?

Waterproof mascara is a specially formulated type of cosmetic that provides the wearer with smudge-proof, waterproof, and long-lasting coverage on their eyelashes. It is designed to prevent the mascara from smearing, running, or flaking away when exposed to water, sweat, or tears, making it a more durable choice than regular mascara. 

Waterproof mascara often contains polymers that help create a protective barrier around the eyelashes, keeping the product in place. This makes it an ideal choice for those with oily skin, active lifestyles, or simply anyone in search of a more long-lasting mascara option. However, it may require a bit more effort to remove at the end of the day compared to regular mascara. 


### What are the benefits of using waterproof mascara?

Waterproof mascara offers several benefits compared to regular mascara. Its primary advantage is its ability to withstand water, sweat, and tears, thus staying in place for a longer period of time. This makes it an excellent choice for various situations such as swimming, exercising, or even just a day in the rain. 

Another benefit of using waterproof mascara is that it can help reduce smudging and smearing, which is a common issue with traditional mascara. By creating a protective barrier around the eyelashes, waterproof mascara is less likely to get smudged, resulting in a more precise and controlled appearance. This is particularly beneficial for those looking to create a more defined and polished makeup look. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Mascara"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Waterproof-Mascara-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Waterproof-Mascara-5" height="540"></a></div>


### How does waterproof mascara stay in place?

Waterproof mascara stays in place due to the ingredients it contains, specifically polymers. These polymers create a protective barrier around the eyelashes, ensuring that the color and application remain intact even when exposed to water, sweat, or tears. This specialized formula is designed to withstand various factors that would typically cause mascara to smear or run, such as moisture and friction from blinking or touching. 

Additionally, waterproof mascara can be applied in multiple thin layers, which helps build up an extra layer of protection around the eyelashes. This ensures that the product remains in place, without running or smudging, even in intense situations like swimming or a sweaty workout session. The extra layers also help enhance the color and gloss of the mascara, making it last longer on the lashes. 


### Is waterproof mascara safe for sensitive eyes?

Yes, waterproof mascara is generally formulated to be safe for sensitive eyes. However, it is still essential to test a small amount on your skin to determine if you may have an adverse reaction. Similar to traditional mascara, waterproof mascara should never be used around the eye area if there are any signs of irritation or infection. 

If you have extremely sensitive eyes or have had issues with mascara in the past, it is advisable to consult with your dermatologist or optometrist before trying a new mascara product. They can provide personalized advice and recommend products that are best suited to your specific needs and sensitivities.

### How do you remove waterproof mascara?

Removing waterproof mascara is a bit more challenging compared to regular mascara but can still be done using the right products and techniques. One effective method involves using an oil-based makeup remover or cleansing balm that specifically targets and dissolves waterproof makeup. Apply a bit of the product onto a cotton pad or makeup remover wipe and gently press it onto the eyelashes to loosen the mascara. 

Another method uses micellar water, a specialized cleanser that can effectively dissolve and remove waterproof makeup. Soak a cotton pad in micellar water, place it over the eyelashes, and gently press it until the mascara starts to loosen and dissolve. Be patient and repeat if necessary to ensure your lashes are properly cleaned. 


### Can I use waterproof mascara if I wear contact lenses?

Yes, you can use waterproof mascara even if you wear contact lenses. However, it is essential to ensure that the mascara does not irritate your eyes or cause any discomfort while wearing your lenses. Some people may be more sensitive to certain ingredients found in waterproof mascara, which could result in irritation or redness. 

To avoid any potential issues, you should always perform a patch test by applying a small amount of the mascara near the eyes and waiting a few hours to see if you experience any reactions. If no irritation occurs, you can proceed to apply the waterproof mascara as usual. Remember, if you feel any discomfort or irritation while wearing the mascara, discontinue use and consult with your eye doctor if necessary.
