When evaluating a Skagen Watch, center around the design that resonates most with you. Take into account your personal style and the events where you'll wear the watch. Skagen provides an array of colors and materials, ensuring an extensive repertoire of choices.


### Materials and Craftsmanship

Skagen Watches are offered in diverse materials such as stainless steel, silver-tone, and rose gold stainless steel. Straps are usually made from leather, silicone, or stainless steel. Assess the overall quality of the watch you intend to buy. Look for sturdy and enduring materials to ensure your watch can withstand the daily grind.


### Movement and Battery Life

Skagen Watches offer both quartz and automatic movements. Quartz watches generally yield higher precision and require minimal maintenance, whereas automatic watches are self-winding and powered by the wearer's actions. Battery life will vary based on the type of movement and the watch's features. Deliberate over the frequency of battery replacement or the need to manually wind the watch if you choose a particular type of movement.


### Water Resistance and Additional Features

Water resistance is a critical aspect to consider while purchasing a watch. If you live an active lifestyle or plan to swim with your watch, seek a watch with at least 50 meters of water resistance. Skagen Watches also come equipped with other features including date displays, chronograph capabilities, and alarm settings. Determine which features fit your requirements best before finalizing your decision.
