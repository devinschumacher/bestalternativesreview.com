As a recent owner of this Custom Made Exterior Storm Window, I've come to appreciate its robust design and energy-saving benefits. The window has already made a significant difference in keeping my home warm during chilly nights. 

However, it did require a bit of TLC to keep it looking as good as new. A few stubborn stains persisted even after a thorough cleaning, which was a minor setback. Overall, it's a well-crafted addition to my home's exterior, and I look forward to witnessing its long-term performance.

The items are easy to install, making it a breeze to set up as a defense against harsh weather conditions. 

One downside I've noticed is that the exterior appearance could use a bit more cleaning than usual.

### [Custom Exterior Storm Glass Window for Weather Protection](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Storm+Windows?utm\_term=custom-exterior-storm-glass-window-for-weather-protection)

Its clear glass design provided an unobstructed view of the outside, which was a welcome change from my old windows.

### [Universal CRL Storm Window Frame with Pre-Installed Vinyl Gasket and Built-In Weatherstripping](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Storm+Windows?utm\_term=universal-crl-storm-window-frame-with-pre-installed-vinyl-gasket-and-built-in-weatherstripping)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Storm+Windows?utm_term=universal-crl-storm-window-frame-with-pre-installed-vinyl-gasket-and-built-in-weatherstripping"><img alt="crl-bs1brz-bronze-universal-crl-sash-storm-window-frame-146-inch-stock-length-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crl-bs1brz-bronze-universal-crl-sash-storm-window-frame-146-inch-stock-length-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The CRL BS1BRZ Bronze Universal CRL storm window frame is a versatile and practical piece for any homeowner seeking durability and security in their window panels. I recently decided to install one of these frames myself, and I couldn't be happier with the results. 

One of my favorite features of the CRL-Sash Universal Storm Window Frame is its acceptance of both single and double strength glass or acrylic, up to 1/8" 3 mm thick. It's perfect for use in a variety of settings - both interior and exterior - and the pre-installed vinyl gasket eliminates the need for messy adhesives so often found in other types of storm window frames. 

However, one downside I encountered was the potential challenge during installation. The roll-formed aluminum body provides rigidity while keeping the panel lightweight, but this can also make it a bit difficult to maneuver and secure the frame onto the window. Overall, though, the ease of fabrication - whether it be through miter cut or square cut methods - makes up for this minor inconvenience. 

I appreciated the CRL-Sash Universal Storm Window Frame's universal compatibility, as well as the wide range of lengths it comes in. My particular model, measuring at 12'-2" 3.66 m long, proved to be a perfect fit for my needs. 

Overall, while it may require a bit of extra effort during installation, the CRL BS1BRZ Bronze Universal CRL storm window frame is a reliable and sturdy option for any homeowner seeking high-quality storm window frames.

Made of glass, it felt sturdy and substantial, giving my home a sense of security against the elements. The installation was surprisingly easy, and they're really well made.

The most impressive feature was the hook latch lock that securely held the sashes together. It provided a sense of peace and security. 

The frame's water removal was efficient, and the window's interlocking sashes helped to keep out unwanted pests. However, one downside was the lack of hardware included, which meant I had to buy it separately. Overall, it's a fantastic choice for adding both functionality and style to your space. 


### [Universal Storm Window Frame for Durable Protection](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Storm+Windows?utm\_term=universal-storm-window-frame-for-durable-protection)

For one, the square cut fabrication method didn't quite work for me because the corners weren't fitting snugly around the window. However, I was able to get around this by using miter cuts instead. Another drawback was the need to use a hack saw and file, as the frame arrived bent and required some adjustments. 

Overall, I'd say the CRL-Sash Universal Storm Window Frame is a solid choice for anyone looking to make their own storm windows. It boasts a tight, secure fit and is durable enough to withstand harsh weather conditions. Just be prepared to put in some extra effort when it comes to trimming and straightening the frame.

## Buyer's Guide

When it comes to protecting your home from harsh weather conditions, storm windows can be a valuable investment. This buyer's guide will provide you with essential information on essential features, considerations, and advice for choosing the right storm windows to keep your home safe and comfortable. Remember, always read product descriptions and reviews to ensure you make an informed decision. 


### Materials

Storm windows are typically made of metal, vinyl, or wood. Metal storm windows provide excellent durability and strength, but they can be expensive and heavy.

Wood storm windows offer a traditional appearance and excellent insulation, but they require more maintenance to keep them looking good. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Storm+Windows"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Storm-Windows-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Storm-Windows-2" height="540"></a></div>


### Insulation

Insulation is a crucial factor when choosing storm windows. The best storm windows provide excellent insulation to keep your home warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Look for storm windows with multiple layers of glass or air gaps between the panes to maximize insulation. Additionally, consider using thermal-pane storm windows for even better insulation. 


### Installation

Storm windows can be installed internally or externally. Internal storm windows fit inside your existing windows and can be removed easily when not needed. External storm windows fit outside your existing windows and provide more protection but may be more expensive and difficult to install. Consider your budget, installation skills, and the level of protection you need when deciding between internal and external storm windows.

### Maintenance

Storm windows require minimal maintenance, but they still need to be cleaned and inspected regularly. Look for storm windows that are easy to clean and have removable parts for easy maintenance. Additionally, check your storm windows regularly for any signs of damage, such as cracks or gaps, and repair or replace them as needed to ensure they continue to provide effective protection against harsh weather conditions.

### What are storm windows and how do they operate?

Storm windows are an extra layer of windows designed to function as a shield against unfavorable weather, offering an additional layer of insulation and protection for your property. They usually fit within the existing window frames and can be either stationary or operable. The functions of storm windows include minimizing air penetration, maintaining consistent indoor temperatures, and preventing drafts and condensation. 

During intense storms or severe weather events, storm windows protect the interior windows from wind, rain, hail, and other debris. They are specifically engineered to withstand such situations, making them a wise investment for homeowners in high-risk weather zones or those with older homes that demand extra insulation. 


### What advantages do storm windows provide?

Storm windows offer multiple advantages, including heightened energy efficiency, increased safeguard against weather-related harm, and amplified comfort for residents. By inhibiting air infiltration, storm windows help sustain a consistent indoor temperature, potentially leading to decreased energy expenses during colder months. They also provide an extra barrier against wind, rain, and other weather risks, lowering the likelihood of window damage and harm to your house's structure. 

Storm windows can contribute to a more enjoyable living environment, as they effectively reduce drafts and condensation. This is particularly beneficial in older homes or those with poorly insulated windows, which can result in cold spots and an uncomfortable living space. Overall, storm windows are an efficient and budget-friendly remedy for improving energy efficiency, protection, and comfort at home.

### What materials are storm windows generally constructed from?

Storm windows are typically crafted from durable and long-lasting materials, such as aluminum, vinyl, or wood. Aluminum storm windows are characterized by their strength and corrosion resistance, making them a widely popular option in regions with harsh weather conditions. Vinyl storm windows are lightweight, low-maintenance, and easy to clean, making them a suitable choice for homeowners seeking a more economical choice. 

Wood storm windows, although more expensive than aluminum or vinyl alternatives, offer a sophisticated and elegant appearance that can complement the aesthetic of many homes. Wooden storm windows, however, require regular maintenance, including painting or staining, to maintain their finish and shield against weather-related deterioration. 


### Can storm windows be tailored to fit distinct window sizes and designs?

Yes, storm windows are generally available in a variety of standard sizes and styles to accommodate diverse window configurations. Nevertheless, if you have unique or custom window dimensions or shapes, it is possible to have storm windows custom-made to meet your specific requirements. Numerous manufacturers offer bespoke storm window options or can collaborate with you to create a personalized solution that caters to your unique needs. 

When ordering custom storm windows, it is essential to provide accurate measurements and specifications to ensure a proper fit. It is also advisable to consult with an expert, such as a window installer or manufacturer representative, to guide you through the process and guarantee the best possible outcome.

### What is the typical cost of storm windows?

The cost of storm windows varies significantly based on aspects like window size and style, materials used, and the level of customization required. On average, you can anticipate spending between $100 to $800 or more per window, with some high-end options costing even more. To obtain an accurate estimate for your specific needs, it is best to consult with a local window supplier or manufacturer for a personalized quote. 

It is crucial to remember that although storm windows need an initial investment, they can save you money on energy bills and reduce the risk of costly repairs or replacements due to weather-related damage. In the long run, they can prove a cost-effective solution for homeowners seeking to enhance the energy efficiency, protection, and comfort of their residence. 


### How are storm windows installed?

Setting up storm windows typically involves multiple steps, including measuring and preparing the windows, installing the storm window hardware, and fitting the storm windows into the existing window frames. The exact procedures may differ depending on the type of storm window you choose and your home's specific setup. 

If you are not confident in installing the storm windows yourself, it is recommended to employ a professional window installer to ensure the task is completed correctly and efficiently.
