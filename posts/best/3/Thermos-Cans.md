### [Insulated Stainless Steel Food Jar for Kids](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Thermos+Cans?utm\_term=insulated-stainless-steel-food-jar-for-kids)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Thermos+Cans?utm_term=insulated-stainless-steel-food-jar-for-kids"><img alt="thermos-funtainer-stainless-steel-food-jar-black-10-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/thermos-funtainer-stainless-steel-food-jar-black-10-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Recently, I started using the Thermos Funtainer Stainless Steel Food Jar to make my child's lunchtime more convenient. The jar's vacuum insulation is a game-changer, as it keeps my daughter's soup warm for up to 5 hours and her yogurt cold for up to 7 hours. 

The lightweight design and wide mouth make it perfect for kids as they can easily gobble up their food on the go. The push-button lid is effortless to operate, and the wide mouth allows for hassle-free filling and cleaning. 

However, there are a few things I wish were better. The dish washer-safety was a bit confusing, as the instructions recommend handwashing while the jar itself is dishwasher safe. Also, the spoon included seems unnecessary, as it often gets detached and needs manual re-attachment. 

Overall, the Thermos Funtainer Stainless Steel Food Jar has become a handy addition to my child's lunchbox, and I would recommend it for other parents looking to simplify their kid's lunchtime routine. 


### [Thermos Stainless Steel Funtainer Food Jar in Purple](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Thermos+Cans?utm\_term=thermos-stainless-steel-funtainer-food-jar-in-purple)

I had the pleasure of trying the Thermos Stainless Steel Funtainer Food Jar in purple - a compact and lightweight companion perfect for both hot and cold meals. The vacuum insulation technology really impressed me; it kept my soup warm for hours on end, and my yogurt stayed chilly for the whole day. 

The push-button lid might seem a bit confusing at first, but once you figure it out, it's super easy to use. The wide mouth design lets you gobble up your food on the go with ease, and it's even dishwasher safe, though hand washing is recommended for the best results. 

A great addition to the jar is the convenient spoon provided with the package. However, be aware that it might take some trial and error to get the insulation just right, pre-chilling or pre-heating the jar before use can be helpful. 

Overall, a trusty and portable companion for your daily meals! 


### [Vacuum Insulated Can Cooler with Sweat-Free Grip](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Thermos+Cans?utm\_term=vacuum-insulated-can-cooler-with-sweat-free-grip)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Thermos+Cans?utm_term=vacuum-insulated-can-cooler-with-sweat-free-grip"><img alt="thermoflask-premium-quality-2-in-1-vacuum-insulated-can-cooler-cup-tall-size-16-ounce-dusty-blue-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/thermoflask-premium-quality-2-in-1-vacuum-insulated-can-cooler-cup-tall-size-16-ounce-dusty-blue-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

After a long day, I craved a cold drink to quench my thirst. My regular can cooler had lost its touch, and I decided to try the ThermoFlask Cup. With its dusty blue exterior, it stood out and caught my eye. This 2-in-1 can cooler was perfect for my poolside party. 

The moment I placed a chilled beer can inside, the ThermoFlask's insulation kicked in, keeping the can at the perfect temperature. And when it was time for a sip, the easy-to-grip design made it effortless to maneuver. One of my favorite features was its sweat-free design, which kept my hands dry and the cooler at a comfortable temperature. 

However, the BPA-free, food-grade stainless steel was a bit hefty, making it harder for older folks to handle, and I had to be mindful of its weight while outdoors. Despite the added weight, the ThermoFlask Cooler Cup proved to be a worthy companion for my adventures and definitely worth considering for its impressive cooling capabilities. 


### [Thermos 12 oz Stainless Steel Insulator Can](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Thermos+Cans?utm\_term=thermos-12-oz-stainless-steel-insulator-can)

The non-slip, scratch-resistant base was a thoughtful addition that made it perfect for use both indoors and outdoors. 

One of the things that really stood out to me was the compact design, complete with a convenient rubber grip that made it comfortable to hold. It even fit one 355ml can snugly and was compatible with most automotive cup holders. That being said, I did notice that it had a bit of a snug fit with certain sizes of cans, so I had to use some additional precaution to keep my drinks secure. But overall, the Thermos Stainless Steel Beverage Can Insulator did its job well and kept my refreshments chilled for the perfect amount of time.

[During a recent camping trip on a hot summer day, I needed a cooler to keep my drinks from getting too warm.](https://gist.github.com/janeknowsbest77/7bcfeff832b90aa42282126522fab891) Luckily, a friend recommended the Thermos Outdoor Series Cold Storage Can Holder. Not only did it keep my beverages perfectly chilled, but its sleek design also made it easy to use as a tumbler. 

One of the highlights of the product for me was its versatility; it was handy as well indoors as outdoors. Despite some minor inconvenience, such as it being slightly heavy to hold, it still offered excellent performance overall. Another feature that stood out to me was its durable construction. It was built with stainless steel and covered in an acrylic resin coating, making it sturdy enough for daily use. 

While I enjoyed the silicone gasket that kept my drink safe and secure, I also noticed that the product's appearance lacked variety. I believe additional color options would be a nice touch to make it more appealing to users.

Overall, the Thermos Outdoor Series Cans Holder provided a great experience that made my camping trip more enjoyable. 


### [Thermos Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated 16 oz. Beverage Bottle](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Thermos+Cans?utm\_term=thermos-stainless-steel-vacuum-insulated-16-oz-beverage-bottle)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Thermos+Cans?utm_term=thermos-stainless-steel-vacuum-insulated-16-oz-beverage-bottle"><img alt="thermos-16-oz-stainless-king-vacuum-insulated-stainless-steel-beverage-bottle-green-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/thermos-16-oz-stainless-king-vacuum-insulated-stainless-steel-beverage-bottle-green-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

During a recent camping trip, I found myself in dire need of a reliable beverage bottle. I stumbled upon the Thermos 16 oz. Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel Bottle, and I must say, it exceeded all my expectations. Its sleek stainless steel exterior and insulated interior made it a perfect companion throughout the trip, keeping my drinks at the ideal temperature for hours on end. 

One of the most impressive features of this bottle is the ability to maintain the temperature of hot beverages for up to 18 hours and cold beverages for as long as 24 hours.

The vented lid with a wide drinking lip also proved to be a game-changer, allowing for easy flow and control of my beverages. 

However, there were a few minor drawbacks to using this product. First, the lid doubling as an insulated serving cup with a twist and pour function took some getting used to, and I found myself accidentally spilling some of my drink in the process. Second, the mouth is quite small, requiring me to use a straw or take small sips to properly drink from the bottle. Lastly, it took a little extra effort to clean after each use, as I found some stubborn residue that stuck to the interior. 

In conclusion, the Thermos 16 oz. Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel Bottle proved to be a reliable and convenient companion for me during my camping trip. Its temperature-retaining capabilities and easy-to-use features made it well worth the investment, despite the minor drawbacks. I highly recommend this bottle to anyone in need of a dependable beverage companion for their outdoor adventures.

This is particularly helpful in the summer months, when I want to enjoy a cool sandwich without the worry of it sweating or getting warm too quickly. 

However, one downside I've encountered is that after prolonged use, some of the scents from my food do seem to transfer to the container. While this doesn't impact the safety or quality of the food, it can be slightly noticeable, so I'd recommend it for those who prefer not to mix their food odors. 

Overall, I'm quite satisfied with the performance of this Thermos 10 oz Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel Food Jar. Its combination of temperature retention capabilities, durability, and easy-to-use design make it a reliable choice when considering a food container for lunch or on-the-go meals.
