### [OTC 7162 Rolling Head Pry Bar](https://serp.ly/amazon/Pry+Bars?utm\_term=otc-7162-rolling-head-pry-bar)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Pry+Bars?utm_term=otc-7162-rolling-head-pry-bar"><img alt="otc-7162-6-rolling-head-pry-bar-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/otc-7162-6-rolling-head-pry-bar-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the OTC (7162) 6" Rolling Head Pry Bar in my daily work as a mechanic. The rolling head pry bar is an extremely handy tool when it comes to aligning bolt holes and moving small parts.

Despite these minor issues, I find the OTC (7162) 6" Rolling Head Pry Bar to be a top-notch tool for mechanics and anyone who needs to align bolt holes or move small parts. It's a lifesaver, especially when dealing with large, heavy parts for bolt-up.

Pry bars are typically made from steel, aluminum, or fiberglass. Steel bars are strong and durable, making them a popular choice for professional use. Aluminum bars are lightweight and suitable for those who require a portable option. Fiberglass bars are non-conductive and corrosion-resistant, which makes them a good choice for wet environments, but they may not have the same strength as steel or aluminum. 


### Size and Shape

The size and shape of a pry bar can impact its performance. Longer bars provide more leverage, while wider bars can offer greater torque. Consider the size and shape that best fits your needs and the types of tasks you will be using the pry bar for. Common shapes include a standard straight bar, L-shaped, and flat-headed designs. 


### Weight and Portability

Weight is an important factor when choosing a pry bar, especially if you plan to take it with you on the go. Lighter pry bars made of aluminum or fiberglass can be easier to transport, while heavier steel bars provide better performance and durability. Consider where and how you'll be using the pry bar to help determine the right balance between weight and performance. 


### Additional Features

Some pry bars come with additional features such as a serrated edge for gripping or a hook for pulling objects. These features can be beneficial in certain situations, so consider whether they align with your needs and usage requirements. It's also important to check for any warranties or guarantees to ensure the quality and reliability of the product. 


## FAQ


### What are pry bars?

Pry bars, also known as pry bars, are versatile long-handled tools used to pry or force open objects. They come in an array of materials, including steel, aluminum, and durable plastic. Their diverse shapes and sizes cater to various tasks, such as lifting or prying apart tightly joined materials.

These indispensable tools are widely utilized in a multitude of applications, including home improvement, construction, automotive repairs, and outdoor pursuits. Their typical applications include removing nails, prying apart stuck objects, and opening paint cans.


### What are the different types of pry bars?

Several types of pry bars are available, and the selection depends on the user's specific needs. Some of the most common varieties include flat bars, claw bars, channel bars, long pry bars, and crow bars. Each pry bar type features its unique shape and design, making them ideal for different tasks.

Flat bars are long and thin, making them perfect for tasks requiring precision and accuracy. They are commonly employed for tasks like prying apart tight seams or lifting thin materials. On the other hand, claw bars are designed with an angled end, making them ideal for lifting heavy objects or extracting nails.


### What is the difference between claw bars and flat bars?

Claw bars and flat bars share some similarities, but they differ in their construction. Claw bars boast an angled end, contrasting with flat bars, which have a straight or flat end. This angle influences each pry bar type's purpose and usage.

Claw bars are designed for tasks that demand more power and leverage. They operate by hooking onto the object's edge or surface before applying force through the leverage of the user's body. They are generally used for heavy-duty tasks, such as lifting heavy objects or removing nails. Flat bars, by contrast, are designed to offer more precision and accuracy when prying or lifting thin materials.


### What is the best pry bar for opening cans of paint?

The perfect pry bar for opening paint cans is typically a flat bar. Flat bars are thin and long, making them ideal for precise tasks like opening tightly sealed paint cans. They provide greater control and precision, which is vital when working with small, tight spaces or delicate materials.

When selecting a pry bar for opening paint cans, another crucial factor to consider is the handle size. The handle should be long enough to provide sufficient leverage but not so long that it becomes unmanageable. It should also be comfortable to grip, with a non-slip surface to prevent the pry bar from slipping in your hand.


### How can I prevent my pry bar from bending or breaking?

To prevent your pry bar from bending or breaking, use it correctly and maintain it properly. Here are some suggestions for utilizing and preserving your pry bar:

* Employ the appropriate size and shape of pry bar for the task at hand.

* Apply even pressure and avoid unnecessary force.

* Keep the pry bar's edge sharp and free from damage to preserve its strength and effectiveness.

* Store the pry bar in a secure, dry location when not in use.

* Avoid dropping the pry bar or allowing it to fall, as this can cause damage.

By following these guidelines, you can help prevent your pry bar from bending or breaking, ensuring it remains a trustworthy tool for all your prying needs. Remember always to exercise caution when using pry bars, as incorrect usage can cause injury or damage to materials and objects. Proper care and use can make a pry bar a valuable and versatile tool in a variety of applications.


### What is the best way to clean and maintain a pry bar?

To keep your pry bar clean and functional, it's essential to frequently clean it and remove any dirt, debris, or rust. Here are some tips for keeping your pry bar clean and in excellent condition:

* Use a steel brush or wire wheel to remove any dirt, debris, or rust from the pry bar's surface.

* Apply a gentle coating of oil or lubricant to the tool, which will help prevent rusting and keep the surface smooth

Moreover, storing your pry bar in a safe, dry location can help prevent rust and keep it in optimal condition. Always inspect your pry bar before each use to ensure it is in good working order and to avoid any unexpected accidents or damage due to a weak or damaged tool. Proper maintenance and care will help extend the pry bar's lifespan and guarantee its reliability for all your prying endeavors.
