As a dog owner, I've always been on the lookout for a premium dog food that not only meets my pup's nutritional needs but also appeals to his tastes. That's why I was drawn to Rachael Ray Nutrish Food for Dogs, Super Premium, Turkey, Brown Rice & Venison Recipe. The first thing that impressed me was the use of farm-raised turkey as the main ingredient, accompanied by protein-rich venison and wholesome brown rice. I loved the idea of a balanced and complete diet that would provide my furry friend with much-needed nutrition. 

While the food seemed to do the trick at first, I quickly noticed some drawbacks. The recurring theme among the first ingredient in these recipes is chicken, which can be problematic for dogs prone to allergies. As a responsible pet owner, I couldn't help but feel concerned about the lack of clear labeling on the packaging, indicating any potential changes in the formula. It can be disheartening when companies make changes without informing their customers, especially when it affects the health of beloved pets.

I had high hopes for this brand, but these issues forced me to seek alternative options for my pup's meals.

### [Rachael Ray Nutrish Lamb & Brown Rice Adult Dog Food](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Rachael+Ray+Dog+Food?utm\_term=rachael-ray-nutrish-lamb-brown-rice-adult-dog-food)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Rachael+Ray+Dog+Food?utm_term=rachael-ray-nutrish-lamb-brown-rice-adult-dog-food"><img alt="rachael-ray-nutrish-food-for-adult-dogs-natural-lamb-meal-brown-rice-recipe-6-lb-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rachael-ray-nutrish-food-for-adult-dogs-natural-lamb-meal-brown-rice-recipe-6-lb-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried the Lamb Meal & Brown Rice Recipe dry dog food from Rachael Ray Nutrish. I had heard great things about their limited ingredient options, and my dog is known to have a sensitive stomach, so I thought it would be a good fit. The first thing I noticed was the simplicity of the ingredients list - just six natural ingredients and added vitamins and minerals. I loved that their lamb meal is the number one ingredient, followed by five other wholesome ingredients. However, I was a bit disappointed to find that they had recently changed the formula without clearly announcing it, as some previous reviewers had mentioned. 

After having this dog food for a few weeks, I started to notice that my dog didn't seem as energetic as usual, and his stool became more liquid. As a concerned pet owner, I reached out to the company, and they informed me that the formula had indeed changed, but they didn't update their packaging or website clearly. I ended up switching to a different brand, and my dog got his energy levels back in no time. I wish Rachael Ray Nutrish had been more transparent about the change and maybe warned their customers directly. Overall, I still think the original idea of simple, limited ingredient dog food is a great one, but I wasn't impressed with the execution in this case.

The primary ingredient, real salmon, is truly a savory delight and it provides my dog with plenty of easily-digestible protein.

The addition of wholesome fruits and vegetables, such as sweet potatoes and beet pulp, is a welcomed touch. The natural ingredients offer essential fiber and antioxidants, contributing to an overall healthier diet for my furry friend.

One of the most reassuring aspects is that this dog food is made without grains, gluten, fillers, by-products, artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives. I greatly appreciate the brand's dedication to providing a clean and natural diet for dogs. 

However, I must mention that the smell of the food isn't particularly pleasant. While it doesn't seem to impact my dog's eating behavior, it might be something to bear in mind for those who are more sensitive to odors. 

Another minor concern is that the packaging size could be more convenient for the price. I would prefer a larger bag that doesn't need to be opened as frequently.
