As a parent, I find the Squigz Deluxe Set to be an excellent addition to my child's toy collection. The 50-piece kit, consisting of silicone shapes with suction cups, enables my little one to engage in creative building experiences. I love how it encourages my child to free-form build and create fun structures that are both funky and visually appealing. 

One of the main highlights of this set is the flexible construction. The suction cups stick to other Squigz as well as flat surfaces, allowing my child to experiment with different shapes and designs. The sturdy silicone material ensures that the Squigz will last and be durable for many playtime sessions. 

While I appreciate the variety of shapes and colors in the set, there have been some instances where the suction cups don't hold well. As a result, my child has to adjust and retry several times to get them to stick together. This can be a bit frustrating at times but I understand that the learning process is also a part of the experience. 

On the plus side, the package comes with a convenient container where the Squigz can be easily stored when not in use. This keeps our home tidy, and we've been able to transport them during our travels without losing any pieces. 

Overall, I believe Squigz are worth the investment for the endless creative possibilities and the valuable developmental benefits they provide. However, it's essential to be aware of the suction problem and keep a close eye on your child while playing with the Squigz for safety.
