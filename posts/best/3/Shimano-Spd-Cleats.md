As a frequent mountain biker, making the transition to indoor cycling left me feeling a bit insecure about my cycling performance. The Shimano SPD SM-SH56 Compatible Mountain Indoor Bicycle Cleats Easy Release proved to be the perfect solution for my confidence, both on the spin bike and during my mountain cycling adventures. 

The material of the SPD cleats, made from chrome-molybdenum steel, is a game-changer in terms of comfort and durability. The cleats themselves offer enough float for a smooth and natural feel, while also securing my foot to the pedal during intense rides. The release is simple and straightforward; twist your heels in one direction to release the cleats. 

One small drawback I encountered is that, as opposed to the highlights stating "Single release, " I found the SPD cleats to have a double release, with a twist in two different directions. However, this minor detail didn't affect my overall satisfaction with the product. 

Overall, these cleats provide versatility for my biking needs, whether it's indoor cycling or hitting the trails. I wholeheartedly recommend the Shimano SPD SM-SH56 Compatible Mountain Indoor Bicycle Cleats Easy Release for both beginners and experienced cyclists looking to enhance their indoor and outdoor performance.

I've been using the Shimano SM SH20 SPD-SL Cleat Spacer Set for some time now and I must say, it's been a game-changer. As a cyclist, I often notice that one leg is slightly longer than the other and it can be quite uncomfortable, if not painful, to pedal for long periods of time. This set of stackable cleat spacers has given me the perfect solution to compensate for this discrepancy. 

What truly stands out is the adjustable height range, which provides between 1mm and 5mm of space. This ensures that even those with a significant difference in leg length can find the perfect fit. The set includes 1mm, 2mm, 10mm, and 13.5mm cleat fixing bolts, so you can experiment with the stack height until you find the most comfortable position for your feet. 

One of the best things about this product is its durability. I've had mine for a while now, and they still work as good as new. The spacers are sturdy and do not budge or slide apart, even during intense rides. 

Installing these spacers is a breeze, too. The included longer-length bolts make it a straightforward process. However, I'd recommend starting with the smallest spacer and gradually moving up to larger sizes if needed, as even the smallest difference can make a considerable impact on comfort. 

If you, like me, face leg length discrepancies, the Shimano SM SH20 SPD-SL Cleat Spacer Set is a must-have. It's easy to install, affordable, and most importantly, effective. I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a comfortable and ergonomic cycling experience.

## Buyer's Guide

Shimano SPD cleats are a popular choice for cyclists who want to transition between clip-in and flat pedals effortlessly. In this buyer's guide, we will explore the important features, considerations, and general advice for Shimano SPD cleats to help you make an informed decision. 


### Understanding the SPD Cleat System

Shimano SPD (Shimano Pedaling Dynamics) cleats come in two types: SPD-SL (Shimano Road) and SPD (Shimano Mountain Bike). SPD-SL cleats are designed for road cycling shoes, while SPD cleats are designed for mountain bike shoes. Both types use a system of engagement tabs on the pedal and cleats to secure your foot, allowing you to easily clip in and out during your ride. 


### Choosing the Right SPD Cleats for Your Shoes

It's essential to select the correct cleat type for your shoe style. Generally, road shoes are narrower, while mountain bike shoes have a larger platform. Shimano offers a variety of cleat systems to cater to different shoe sizes and types. Always consult the shoe's manufacturer to ensure compatibility with the intended SPD cleat. 


### Mountain Bike SPD Cleats

Mountain bike SPD cleats typically have a larger engagement surface, providing better stability and power transfer, particularly on uphill terrain. They are ideal for off-road riding, trail biking, or any other mountain bike adventure. The most widely used SPD cleats for mountain bikes are the SPD and SPD-MX. These cleats are designed to be compatible with a wide range of mountain bike shoes and offer excellent durability. 


### Road Bike SPD-SL Cleats

Road bike SPD-SL cleats are designed to give riders a more natural, efficient pedaling motion. They feature a lower profile and a narrower foot platform, which enhances power transfer during sprinting and gives road cyclists greater control over their bike. Shimano offers various SPD-SL cleats such as those in the PD-M765 and PD-570 pedal models. Ensure the chosen road bike SPD-SL cleats are compatible with your road cycling shoes. 


## FAQ


### Uncovering the Mystery of Shimano SPD Cleats

Shimano SPD cleats are a popular choice among mountain bikers and cyclo-cross racers for their exceptional grip and clipping power. These versatile cleat systems attach to the bottom of your cycling shoes, offering an unmatched level of control and precision during pedaling. With Shimano's range of SPD cleat variants such as PD-M320 or PD-M520, you can pair them with your preferred mountain biking shoes for an optimal pedaling experience. 

For those seeking something more suitable for road cycling, Shimano offers a different cleat system called SPD-SL. The primary distinction between these two systems lies in their compatibility and design. While SPD cleats feature a 4-hole pattern to match most mountain biking and cyclo-cross shoes, SPD-SL cleats have a 3-hole pattern that's designed for road shoes with a 3-hole pattern. 


### Exploring the World of Shimano SPD Cleats

Unlike SPD-SL cleats, which are tailored for road cycling, Shimano's SPD cleats have a more rugged and aggressive grip, making them ideal for navigating challenging mountain biking and cyclo-cross terrains. The SPD system provides mountain bikers and cyclo-cross racers with the robust stability they need during their high-intensity pursuits. 


### Mastering the Art of Installing Shimano SPD Cleats

Installing SPD cleats on your cycling shoes is quite straightforward. The first step is to ensure the shoes have compatible 4-hole recesses, and your chosen SPD cleats match your shoes type. If there's ever a doubt, you can consult Shimano's website or visit your local bike shop. Before installing your cleats, remove any existing ones, and apply a tiny amount of blue threadlocker onto the threads. Next, screw the cleats onto the shoes using the appropriate screwdriver, tightening them in a star pattern to ensure proper alignment. Lastly, test the cleats by clipping in and out of your pedals, making sure they're secure and functioning correctly. 


### What Pedal Systems Can I Use Shimano SPD Cleats With?

Shimano SPD cleats are exclusively designed to work with Shimano's own SPD pedal system. This system is specifically engineered to provide seamless compatibility with SPD cleats, ensuring optimal interface and performance. In some instances, it may be possible to find other pedal systems that are compatible with SPD cleats. Examples of such pedal systems include Crankbrothers and Time, which offer cleat options that can be used with multiple pedal systems, including SPD. However, it's essential to always check the manufacturer's website or reach out to your local bike shop to confirm compatibility before making any purchases. 


### Unlocking the Secrets of Cleaning and Maintaining Shimano SPD Cleats

Keeping your Shimano SPD cleats clean and well-maintained isn't only good for their appearance but also ensures their longevity. Begin by gently brushing away any debris or dirt from the cleats using a soft-bristled cleaning brush or an old toothbrush. Focus on those grooves or recessed areas as dirt and bacteria can accumulate there. After brushing, apply a small amount of bike-specific cleaner or rubbing alcohol to a clean cloth or brush, then gently wipe down the cleats, concentrating on the grittiest or discolored areas. Rinse the cleats thoroughly with water, removing all cleaning materials before drying. 


### How Long Do Shimano SPD Cleats Last?

The lifespan of Shimano SPD cleats can vary depending on usage, maintenance, and environmental conditions. With proper care and cleaning, these cleats can last upwards of 500 hours of riding. However, neglect or frequent exposure to harsh environments may reduce the lifespan. When cleats start to show signs of wear, such as discolored grooves or a loss of grip onto the shoe's sole, it may be time to replace them. Consult Shimano's product guidelines or local bike shops for more specific guidance on when your SPD cleats may need to be replaced.
