Although it's compact, it can hold a surprising amount of stuff - my paint supplies, for instance, have found it to be the perfect home. However, the drawer could use a bit of improvement in terms of ease-of-use - it's a tiny gripe, though, in an otherwise near-perfect organizer. 


### [Rectangular Plastic Paper Storage Baskets - Set of 6 (White, Black)](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Paper+Storage?utm\_term=rectangular-plastic-paper-storage-baskets-set-of-6-white-black)

They're ideal for storing office documents, school supplies, or classroom papers. Their rectangular shape and small size make them a godsend for the neat freaks among us. 

However, I noticed that the plastic handle on the baskets doesn't seem to be extremely durable. In fact, it might break under heavy load. Other than that, these trays are pretty reliable for their purpose. They're quite easy to clean, but they're not dishwasher safe, which can be a bit of a bummer. 

In conclusion, these Teyyvn A4 paper storage baskets are a great investment for organizing your papers. They're stylish, efficient, and have a convenient shape. However, be mindful of their plastic handle and the lack of dishwasher safety.

In my experience, the sturdiness of the tray has been top-notch. The pull-out drawers glide smoothly, and the cork lining ensures the papers stay in place without slipping. However, one thing I noticed is that the trays can bow slightly when fully loaded with papers, which may make it a bit tricky to slide them back in.

The adjustable back height was also a great feature, as it prevented any paper from slipping off the top shelf and falling behind the sorter. One minor downside is that the rounded edges of the organizer can make it trickier to slide papers in and out, but overall, it's a minor inconvenience in comparison to the practicality and style this organizer offers. 

While some users have pointed out minor issues, such as a bit of tightness or slightly narrow width, I found that the overall quality and functionality of the Tru Red front-load enclosed wire mesh horizontal document organizer more than make up for these small negatives.

It's made of a fashionable linen fabric, giving it a pop of color and a touch of elegance to my otherwise dull office space.

The large storage capacity was another highlight, as I could easily hang multiple folders or use it for other items besides files. I even appreciated the presence of the label slot, which made it easy for me to classify my items and keep everything organized. 

One downside I encountered was that the slide rails on the lids of the box seemed to be slightly loose at times, causing them to move around a little. However, it didn't impact the functionality too much and was a minor issue compared to the overall positives. 

Overall, I'm happy with my decision to upgrade to the Huolewa storage box. The combination of style, convenience, and practicality has made it a staple in my office organization, and I couldn't be more satisfied with the results.
