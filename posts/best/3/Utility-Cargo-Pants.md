Recently, I had the opportunity to try on a pair of women's High-Rise Utility Cargo Pants from Universal Thread. I couldn't resist sharing my experience. The vibrant yellow color instantly caught my attention - it added a fantastic splash of color to my outfit. However, putting them on made me feel a bit uncomfortable due to the high-rise waistline. It didn't quite flatter my figure as much as I had hoped for. Nevertheless, the straight-fit provided me with some much-needed space. 

These utility cargo pants featured a breathable cotton-blend fabric with a lightweight lining. Despite the ankle length not being ideal for those with a shorter stature like myself, the zipper, fly button, and belt loops offered a snug fit.

Despite the slight discomfort, these utility cargo pants proved to be an excellent addition to my wardrobe. They paired perfectly with blouses, basic tees, and tailored shirts, resulting in various stylish looks. I believe that these pants could be more suitable for someone with a slightly different body type or who prefers a more relaxed fit.

### **Are there waterproof or water-resistant utility cargo pants available?**

*Yes, water-resistant or waterproof utility cargo pants are available on the market. They are made with either a nylon or polyester shell or a waterproof-breathable laminate coating. The choice of fabric plays a significant role in the level of water resistance your pants will provide. Look for options with high water resistance ratings like Gore-Tex or eVent, commonly found in outdoor gear, to ensure maximum protection from rain, snow, and other wet conditions.*

It's crucial to note that water-resistant or waterproof utility cargo pants may not be as breathable or comfortable in hot climates, so choose based on your primary activity or environmental conditions. Read the product descriptions or manufacturer specifications carefully when considering water-resistant or waterproof utility cargo pants.


### **How can I maintain my utility cargo pants to extend their lifespan?**

*To prolong the lifespan of your utility cargo pants, proper care and maintenance are essential. Store them in a cool, dry place when not in use to prevent damage from moisture, mildew, or extreme temperatures. Avoid hanging your pants by the crotch, as it can cause misshaping over time. Instead, lay them flat or hang them evenly across the pockets.*

For cleaning, follow the care instructions provided by the manufacturer. Always use cold water to wash and refrain from bleaching, as this can weaken the fabric and reduce its water resistance properties. Air-dry your pants instead of tumble-drying them, as the heat from the dryer can harm the fabric and weaken the dye color.
