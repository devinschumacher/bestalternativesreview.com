As a long-time tiler, I recently tried out the Schluter Jolly Coated Aluminum Tile Edging Trim in light grey. This was not just for a simple tiling job, but for a decorative remodeling project, and it certainly did not disappoint. I was particularly impressed by how easy it was to install, thanks to its simple embedding design. 

The key feature that stood out was its durability. It seemed resistant to being chipped or damaged, which was especially useful in high-traffic areas. Also, the light grey coating added a sleek, elegant feel to the project, fitting seamlessly with the design vision I had in mind. 

However, while the Jolly Coated Aluminum Tile Edging Trim works great for most tile types, I found that it was a bit tricky to work with large, heavy tiles due to its width. But for the average-sized projects, it did the trick! So, if you're looking for a product with a touch of class and a sturdy structure, this may just be the one.

### [Schluter Jolly Edge Trim 3/8" Beige](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Schluter+Jolly?utm\_term=schluter-jolly-edge-trim-3-8-beige)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Schluter+Jolly?utm_term=schluter-jolly-edge-trim-3-8-beige"><img alt="schluter-jolly-edge-trim-3-8-beige-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/schluter-jolly-edge-trim-3-8-beige-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Schluter Jolly has been a reliable addition to my tile installation projects. It's a perfect blend of style and functionality, and it makes the finishing work a breeze. The beige textured color-coated aluminum finish makes it seamlessly blend in with any wall color. 

Installation is a piece of cake with this trim. You can embed the anchoring leg in thin-set under the tile, while you tile, which saves a lot of time. The slim profile (3/8-inch thick) is not only attractive but also fits perfectly with various residential and commercial applications. 

However, the Schluter Jolly does have a tiny downside. During the installation process, it may cause some discomfort to our hands due to its metal structure. Additionally, it could be a little challenging to handle for beginners owing to its precision required. 

But overall, the Schluter Jolly has been a satisfying purchase. It helped me finish the projects on-time and with a professional look. It perfectly suited my needs for the residential and commercial projects I work on.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Schluter+Jolly?utm_term=schluter-jolly-tile-edge-profile-with-integrated-joint-spacer"><img alt="schluter-jolly-edging-profile-for-1-2-thick-tile-8-2-1-2-length-chrome-plated-solid-brass-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/schluter-jolly-edging-profile-for-1-2-thick-tile-8-2-1-2-length-chrome-plated-solid-brass-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a seasoned home renovator, I've tried many products aimed at protecting my tile edges that often chip when subjected to water or excessive wear. The Schluter Jolly edging profile stands out in this regard. This 8-foot length, 1/2-inch thick profile made of sturdy brass, beautifully adorns the edges of your tiled walls or countertops, providing a chic boundary. 

A particularly helpful feature is its integrated joint spacer that ensures a clean, uniform joint between the tile and the chrome-plated solid brass profile. It's versatile too, perfect for top-of-the-wall transitions, bathtub surrounds, or even decorative wall transitions. 

However, one drawback is its potential cost, which might be on the higher side compared to some other products in the market. Plus, installation might require specific skills and tools, adding a bit more complexity to the user-friendly nature that some may expect. Despite these minor caveats, the Schluter Jolly edging profile offers robust protection and added elegance to your tiled spaces.
