### [Purple Premium Smart Base - Split King Mattress](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Purple+3+Hybrid+Premier+Mattress?utm\_term=purple-premium-smart-base-split-king-mattress)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Purple+3+Hybrid+Premier+Mattress?utm_term=purple-premium-smart-base-split-king-mattress"><img alt="purple-premium-smart-base-split-king-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/purple-premium-smart-base-split-king-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Purple Premium Smart Base has been a game-changer for my sleep experience. The app and wireless remote control make adjusting the head and foot elevation a breeze, and the Zero-Gravity preset offers an excellent tension relief. However, the adjustable-height legs are not quite as sturdy as I'd like, and I wish the base was a bit prettier. 

Overall, the benefits outweigh the negatives, and I highly recommend this to anyone looking to upgrade their sleep experience. 


### [Purple Restore Premier Soft Queen Mattress - GelFlex Grid and Adaptive Comfort for Cool and Supportive Sleep](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Purple+3+Hybrid+Premier+Mattress?utm\_term=purple-restore-premier-soft-queen-mattress-gelflex-grid-and-adaptive-comfort-for-cool-and-supportive-sleep)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Purple+3+Hybrid+Premier+Mattress?utm_term=purple-restore-premier-soft-queen-mattress-gelflex-grid-and-adaptive-comfort-for-cool-and-supportive-sleep"><img alt="purple-queen-restore-premier-soft-mattress-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/purple-queen-restore-premier-soft-mattress-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently upgraded to the Purple Restore Premier Soft Queen Mattress after struggling with lower back pain for years. The mattress felt incredibly comfortable, and I loved how it contoured to my body and provided excellent support. The 3" GelFlex grid drew heat away, keeping me cool and comfortable throughout the night, which was a major plus for me. However, I did notice that the mattress was a bit firmer than expected, making it a bit challenging for my partner, who prefers a softer mattress. 

One issue I faced while using the mattress was the lack of edge support. The foam edges were too soft, causing me to feel like I was falling off the bed when I sat down or got out of bed. However, the responsive coil core provided outstanding pressure relief, making it perfect for my lower back. 

One of the best things about this mattress was the edge-to-edge coils that worked seamlessly with the foam, giving it excellent support. The Ultra Comfort Foam layer also worked perfectly with the support system, making it easy to get in and out of bed, which was a huge plus for me. Additionally, the SoftFlex cover was anti-microbial treated and stretchable, which helped it stay fresh and kept me cool and dry. 

In conclusion, the Purple Restore Premier Soft Queen Mattress offers exceptional comfort and support. While the firmness may not be ideal for everyone, the edge-to-edge coils make it a great choice for those who need extra support. With its heat-wicking capabilities and easy-to-clean cover, this mattress is definitely worth considering for an excellent night's sleep. 


### [Purple Rejuvenate Hybrid Sleep Twin XL](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Purple+3+Hybrid+Premier+Mattress?utm\_term=purple-rejuvenate-hybrid-sleep-twin-xl)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Purple+3+Hybrid+Premier+Mattress?utm_term=purple-rejuvenate-hybrid-sleep-twin-xl"><img alt="purple-rejuvenate-mattress-twin-xl-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/purple-rejuvenate-mattress-twin-xl-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

During my quest for a comfortable and supportive mattress, I picked up the Rejuvenate Twin XL from the Purple mattress line. I have to admit, it's made a huge difference in my sleep! The cushioning from the Euro Top feels luxurious and the GelFlex Grid Plus offers stability without sacrificing comfort. It's like sleeping on a cloud but also supportive, which seemed impossible before. 

There's one thing, however, that did catch me off guard. My husband and I love firm beds, but we found this one to be somewhat mushy. We're not sure if it's because we're so used to rock hard mattresses, or if it's just the three-zone coil core not providing the firmness we desired. It's taken some adjustment, but we're hoping to settle into it soon. 

Overall, my experience with the Purple Rejuvenate has been largely positive. I'm just waiting to see if our preferences align better with this one after a few more nights. If you're also in the market for a mattress that's a blend of comfort and support, give the Purple Rejuvenate a try! 


### [Nectar Premier Hybrid Twin Mattress: Luxurious Support & Breathability](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Purple+3+Hybrid+Premier+Mattress?utm\_term=nectar-premier-hybrid-twin-mattress-luxurious-support-breathability)

[First and foremost, the mattress is a hybrid of the best of both worlds, offering both the comfort of memory foam and the sturdiness of innerspring.](https://gist.github.com/janeknowsbest77/80c6aacea7664ad3985d7369aae20bf7) The contouring memory foam provides support and cushioning, while the innerspring coil layer ensures breathability and reduces motion transfer. The combination of these two elements makes for a balanced sleep experience that has been a game-changer for me. 

One of the standout features of this mattress is its cooling cover. It's quilted and treated with Microban antimicrobial protection, which has been a great help in maintaining the cleanliness and freshness of my mattress. Additionally, the mattress has a higher profile that provides excellent pressure relief, which has helped to alleviate my back pain. 

Of course, there are a few minor drawbacks. For one, the mattress has a slight odor when it's first unboxed, but it dissipates over time. And while the mattress is quite comfortable, I have noticed that the support does seem to decline over the course of a few years. However, Nectar offers a lifetime warranty, which gives me confidence in the durability of the product. 

In conclusion, the Nectar Premier Hybrid has been a reliable and comfortable addition to my sleep routine. While it may not be perfect, its balance of comfort, support, and affordability make it a solid choice for anyone looking to upgrade their mattress.

This particular model boasts an extra layer of breathability, ensuring that I remain cool and comfortable throughout the night. It's a feature I never knew I needed, but now, I can't imagine sleeping without it. And the fact that it is made right here in the USA adds to its appeal. 

Of course, no product is immune to minor flaws. I did experience a minor issue with a slight odor that took a bit of time to dissipate. However, it did not last long, and I was able to resume my peaceful slumber on the Purple mattress.

### [Purple Plus King 3 Hybrid Premier Mattress](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Purple+3+Hybrid+Premier+Mattress?utm\_term=purple-plus-king-3-hybrid-premier-mattress)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Purple+3+Hybrid+Premier+Mattress?utm_term=purple-plus-king-3-hybrid-premier-mattress"><img alt="purple-plus-king-mattress-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/purple-plus-king-mattress-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The first thing I noticed was the cool temperature - it truly lived up to its promise of open air channels and temperature-neutral materials. I also appreciated the motion-isolating technology, which meant I wouldn't disturb my husband if I tossed and turned during the night. The gel-infused foam base provides great pressure point relief and a perfect balance of softness and firmness. 

The mattress arrived quickly and neatly rolled in a box, making it easy to set up. However, I did find that the edge support was slightly lacking, causing me to sink in a little too much when sitting on the edge of the bed. Additionally, the King size takes up quite a bit of space, which might be a concern for those with smaller bedrooms. 

Overall, the Purple Plus King Mattress has significantly improved my sleep experience. While it has a few minor drawbacks, the benefits far outweigh them. I'd highly recommend this mattress to anyone looking for a comfortable and cool sleeping experience. 


### [Purple 3 Hybrid Premier Twin Mattress](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Purple+3+Hybrid+Premier+Mattress?utm\_term=purple-3-hybrid-premier-twin-mattress)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Purple+3+Hybrid+Premier+Mattress?utm_term=purple-3-hybrid-premier-twin-mattress"><img alt="purple-mattress-twin-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/purple-mattress-twin-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer, I recently tried the Purple Mattress and wanted to share my experience with you all. I was excited to see if it would be worth all the hype it's been getting. 

First, let me say that the mattress arrived quickly and was easy to set up. I noticed right away that it had a unique feel – something different from traditional mattresses. It felt like it was instantly adapting to my body, providing deeper full-body comfort. 

One of the most impressive features was the Dual-Layer Comfort Core, which provided adaptive and substantial support. The 2" GelFlex Grid really cradled my pressure points and allowed me to sleep without any discomfort. 

However, there were a couple of drawbacks. I did notice a slight unpleasant odor when I first opened the mattress, but it dissipated within a few days. Additionally, the Purple Mattress is not cheap, and it might be a bit heavy on the wallet for some people. 

Overall, the Purple Mattress was quite comfortable, but then again, everyone's preferences are different. I would definitely recommend trying it out for yourself to see if it's the right fit for you.
