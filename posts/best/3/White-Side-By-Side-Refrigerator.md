I recently installed a Whirlpool 36-Inch Wide Side-By-Side Refrigerator in my kitchen, and let me tell you - it's been a game-changer. The adjustable gallon door bins give me so much flexibility in how I store my groceries. I'm a big fan of the hidden hinges, too - it gives the fridge a sleek, seamless look. Plus, the electronic temperature controls make it super easy to keep everything at the perfect chill. 

One thing that stood out was the LED lighting. Not only does it keep my food looking fresh and appealing, but it's also incredibly convenient when I need to grab something at night. The humidity-controlled crispers also make a huge difference in preserving my fruits and veggies. 

However, there were a couple of nits I had to pick. The exterior ice and water dispenser with EveryDrop water filtration sometimes leaks a bit around the edges. I also wish the LED night-light for the ice and water dispenser was a bit brighter. 

Overall, I'm thrilled with my new fridge. It's spacious, easy to use, and it looks great in my kitchen. I highly recommend it!

Despite this, the refrigerator continues to provide efficient performance in handling its primary task.

The GE side-by-side refrigerator has been a welcome addition to my kitchen. The white exterior beautifully complements my decor and the model fits virtually flush with my surrounding cabinetry - a sleek, built-in look that makes my kitchen feel even more spacious. 

While exploring this fridge, I encountered a few features that made my experience a little mixed. On one hand, I appreciated the LED lights, which provided bright, crisp illumination. However, I felt the need to reach for an additional light when I was peering into the deep recesses of the fridge, as it fell a bit short in the back. 

Moreover, I took advantage of the raised edges, which did an excellent job keeping spills in check. The adjustable sliding glass shelves, in particular, proved quite useful. They are flexible enough to accommodate a variety of needs and the spillproof feature prevented accidental messes when I was loading the fridge. That said, I found the clear door bins a little less than ideal; they just didn't quite provide the spaciousness I required. 

One major downside was the counter depth design. While it looked sleek, it inevitably led to more wasted space. I was pleasantly surprised, though, to find a hidden storage solution in the form of under-shelf drawers. They were just the right size, and a far more functional feature than any of the alternative solutions I'd considered. 

All in all, the GE side-by-side refrigerator has brought a breath of fresh air into my kitchen. Although it does have its flaws, the good clearly outweighs the bad, and I've come away with a fairly positive impression of this appliance.

As a reviewer, I've had the chance to use the 22.6 Cu. ft. KitchenAid Side-by-Side Refrigerator for a few months now, and let me tell you, it's quite an experience. The first feature that caught my attention was the sleek PrintShield Finish, which not only looks great but is also very easy to clean. This refrigerator is absolutely packed with features that make food preservation a breeze, like the Preserva Food Care System with two independent cooling systems, a FreshFlow Air Filter to reduce odors, and a Produce Preserver to delay over-ripening of fruits and vegetables. The In-Door-Ice System is a game-changer, with ice being placed where we need it most, freeing up more shelf space. 

The energy-efficient LED lighting inside the refrigerator and freezer is another standout feature. The clear door bins with metallic accents allow for easy access to your condiments and they even keep labels visible. One of my favorite highlights is the exterior ice and water dispenser, which makes it so convenient to get a glass of water or a quick snack. And let's not forget about the beautiful counter-depth design, which almost perfectly matches my kitchen cabinets. 

However, I've also encountered a few issues with this refrigerator. First, it seems that the control board has a tendency to go bad frequently, and having to replace it can cost a significant amount. Second, I've noticed a bit of flimsiness in the shelf and drawer system, which can be frustrating when trying to organize your fridge. 

In conclusion, while the 22.6 Cu. ft. KitchenAid Side-by-Side Refrigerator offers a sleek design and plenty of useful features, it's not without its drawbacks. However, if you're willing to overlook these issues and are in the market for a spacious and efficient refrigerator, this one could be worth considering.

As a busy mom, I was in desperate need of a new fridge that could keep up with our daily routines and easily accommodate the ever-expanding list of ingredients we use to create our family meals. When I stumbled upon the Espresso Salerno 33-inch side-by-side refrigerator, I was immediately drawn to its sleek design and ample space. 

One of the first things I noticed about this fridge was the LED Touch Control. Navigating the temperature settings was a breeze, and I appreciated the accuracy and intuitive ease-of-use. The freezer compartment, in particular, was impressive, with its 4 spill-proof glass shelves and 3 storage bins, allowing me to organize everything from frozen fruits to ice packs with ease. 

However, there were a couple of areas where the Espresso Salerno could improve. The freezer door could be a bit wider, as I often found myself struggling to fit larger containers in the door bin.

This Whirlpool refrigerator has been a game-changer in my daily life. I've been using this side-by-side refrigerator for quite a while now, and it's been incredibly reliable. The exterior ice and water dispenser has been great, making it even easier to grab a glass of cold water or ice, especially during the hot summer days. The hidden hinges also make the fridge look sleek and clean, adding to its appeal. 

One of the features that stood out to me the most was the adjustable gallon door bins. These bins slide in the door, allowing me to easily rearrange them for increased flexibility when loading the fridge. This has been particularly helpful when I've had larger items to store, such as a large container of leftovers or a gallon of milk. 

The deli drawer is another standout feature. I love being able to store my favorite meats and cheeses in here, keeping them fresh and organized. It also helps me free up more shelf space in the main refrigerator compartment. 

However, there have been a few cons to my experience with this Whirlpool refrigerator. For instance, the adjustable door bins can be a bit tricky to maneuver, and it took me some time to figure out the best way to slide them in and out. Additionally, the exterior dispenser can sometimes be a bit finicky, and I've had to manually dispense water and ice on occasion. 

Overall, I've been very satisfied with this Whirlpool Wide Side-By-Side Refrigerator. Its unique storage features make it a great option for busy families, and the adjustable door bins have been especially helpful. While there have been a few minor issues, I believe this refrigerator has been well worth the investment.

The ample space it provides for our small family is more than sufficient, and it maintains the ideal temperatures in the refrigerator and freezer. I love how this ENERGY STAR certified refrigerator keeps the food looking and tasting great with its LED lighting. 

When it comes to the features, the water dispenser with Everydrop water filtration system is a game-changer. It's easy to access and provides us with filtered water whenever we need it. The full-width temperature-controlled drawer and adaptive defrost system are also really handy for storing and preserving large quantities of food items. 

However, there are a few minor cons to this otherwise excellent refrigerator. The lower full-width drawer could be more functional and used more efficiently, and the humidity slider on the veggie/fruit drawers can sometimes catch on the drawer when closing. 

Overall, I'm really happy with my purchase and would recommend this Whirlpool refrigerator to anyone in the market for a white side-by-side option that offers ample space, stylish design, and useful features.

## Buyer's Guide

When it comes to purchasing a [white side by side refrigerator](https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativesreview.com/blob/main/posts/best/3/White-Side-By-Side-Refrigerator.md), there are several important factors to consider to ensure that you are making the best possible investment. In this buyer's guide, we will discuss essential features, considerations, and general advice to help you find the perfect white side by side refrigerator for your needs.

One of the first things you'll want to consider when looking for a white side by side refrigerator is its capacity. This refers to the total amount of storage space available inside the fridge.
