### [Orion Observer Equatorial Reflector Telescope - Perfect for Stargazing and Amateur Astronomy](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Telescope+For+Beginners?utm\_term=orion-observer-equatorial-reflector-telescope-perfect-for-stargazing-and-amateur-astronomy)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Telescope+For+Beginners?utm_term=orion-observer-equatorial-reflector-telescope-perfect-for-stargazing-and-amateur-astronomy"><img alt="orion-observer-134mm-equatorial-reflector-telescope-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/orion-observer-134mm-equatorial-reflector-telescope-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Orion Observer 134mm Equatorial Reflector Telescope has quickly become the go-to choice for my family and me. [As a novice astro enthusiast, I was looking for a telescope that could give me a solid start in my stargazing journey, and this backyard beauty certainly fits the bill.](https://gist.github.com/janeknowsbest77/e5cc40605a5f6bc7fae0d4ac9fab7e71) 

The telescope's 134mm (5.3") parabolic primary mirror and 650mm focal length (f/4.9) offer impressive wide views of the lunar surface, Saturn's rings, and intriguing deep-space marvels like the Lagoon and Orion nebulas, as well as the Andromeda galaxy. It's truly awe-inspiring to witness these celestial wonders up close. 

The Orion Observer's optical tube sits atop a sturdy EQ3 class equatorial mount with an adjustable aluminum tripod, ensuring a steady and secure setup. The tube can be quickly taken on and off the mount thanks to its Vixen-style dovetail feature, offering easy transport when it's time to pack up shop for the night. 

One of the standout features is the precision rack and pinion focuser, which allows for precise focus every time, resulting in crystal-clear images. It's like having my very own window into the cosmos. 

While the 6x30 crosshair finder scope is a handy tool for locating and centering desired targets, I've found that it could use a slightly larger field of view for more accurate navigation. However, this doesn't detract from the overall performance of the telescope. 

The entire setup, including the optical tube, mount, and accessories, weighs just over 18 lbs, making it a breeze to carry out to the backyard on clear nights. It's light enough to be comfortable to transport, yet heavy enough to provide steady images even in breezy conditions. 

In conclusion, the Orion Observer 134mm Equatorial Reflector Telescope has proved to be an excellent investment for my family and me as we embark on our journey into the night sky. It offers a robust, portable, and user-friendly experience that's perfect for both solo stargazing and family adventures. Highly recommended for those looking to explore the wonders of the cosmos. 


### [National Geographic 70mm Refracting Telescope with User-Friendly Design](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Telescope+For+Beginners?utm\_term=national-geographic-70mm-refracting-telescope-with-user-friendly-design)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Telescope+For+Beginners?utm_term=national-geographic-70mm-refracting-telescope-with-user-friendly-design"><img alt="national-geographic-70mm-refracting-telescope-with-case-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/national-geographic-70mm-refracting-telescope-with-case-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

My experience with this telescope, National Geographic 70mm Refracting Telescope with Case, has been quite an adventure! I recently got this telescope as a gift, and it has truly expanded my horizons. 

The telescope is incredibly easy to set up, with a smooth AZ panhandle mount and clear instructions. It makes it perfect for beginners, like me, and families who want to explore the wonders of the night sky together. The smart device adapter is a thoughtful feature that allows you to capture and share your observations effortlessly with your friends and family. 

However, one of the downsides I experienced is that the telescope felt somewhat flimsy, not sturdy enough to withstand rough handling or use during windy nights. The tripod could have been more stable, as it seemed to wobble occasionally. But overall, the telescope performed well in terms of precision targeting, thanks to the red-dot finder that helped me locate and focus on my desired celestial objects swiftly. 

One of the highlights of this telescope is its high-quality optics, boasting an achromatic refracting design, 70mm aperture, and 400mm focal length. These features provided me with crisp, clear views and a more authentic stargazing experience. Adding to that, the complete package offered by National Geographic ensured that I had everything I needed to start my stargazing journey right away. I was particularly excited about the interchangeable eyepieces, mount, tripod, solar filter, and travel bag that came with the kit. 

In conclusion, while the telescope has its minor flaws, it has allowed me to explore the vast wonders of the night sky and sparked my curiosity for the universe. It's a great option for beginners or anyone looking to share the awe-inspiring wonders of the cosmos with their family and friends. 


### [Celestron ExploraScope 114AZ 4.5" f/8.8 Alt-Az Reflector Telescope](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Telescope+For+Beginners?utm\_term=celestron-explorascope-114az-4-5-f-8-8-alt-az-reflector-telescope)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Telescope+For+Beginners?utm_term=celestron-explorascope-114az-4-5-f-8-8-alt-az-reflector-telescope"><img alt="celestron-explorascope-114az-4-5-f-8-8-alt-az-reflector-telescope-4-5-114mm-manual-altazimuth-color--1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/celestron-explorascope-114az-4-5-f-8-8-alt-az-reflector-telescope-4-5-114mm-manual-altazimuth-color--1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Celestron ExploraScope 114AZ has been a game-changer for me when it comes to stargazing. First off, the lightweight design and quick set up make it perfect for impromptu stargazing sessions. The tripod is adjustable to multiple heights, which is a plus when you want to enjoy the view from a comfortable position. 

What really stood out to me was the quality of the optics. Despite being a budget-friendly option, the fully coated glass elements provided stunning detail when I observed the Moon or the planets. The red dot finderscope was incredibly helpful in locating objects, making the experience much more enjoyable and less intimidating for a beginner like me. 

However, there were a couple of downsides to using this telescope. The slow-motion rod control seemed a bit too stiff at times, making it difficult to smooth out the pointing motion. Additionally, I found that not all accessories fit securely onto the telescope, which left me feeling a bit concerned about their durability in the long run. 

Overall, the Celestron ExploraScope 114AZ provided fantastic value for money and a fun, straightforward introduction to stargazing. While there were a few minor drawbacks, the pros definitely outweighed the cons in my experience. 


### [SARBLUE Maksutov-Cassegrain Telescope: Compact and Powerful Beginner's Telescope for Astronomy Enthusiasts](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Telescope+For+Beginners?utm\_term=sarblue-maksutov-cassegrain-telescope-compact-and-powerful-beginners-telescope-for-astronomy-enthusiasts)

One of its standout features is the micro-movement tripod that adds precision and comfort to my calibration experience. The adjustable tripod, capable of supporting most telescope tubes and DSLR cameras, truly makes it a versatile tool for any outdoor adventure. And the accessories? A 20mm eyepiece for 50x magnification, a 10mm photographic eyepiece for 100x magnification, a universal phone mount with a 1.5x Barlow Lens, and a 5X24 finderscope with an adjustable angle and position, all contribute to a seamless and enjoyable experience. 


### [Celestron NexStar 8SE Sky Exploration Scope](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Telescope+For+Beginners?utm\_term=celestron-nexstar-8se-sky-exploration-scope)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Telescope+For+Beginners?utm_term=celestron-nexstar-8se-sky-exploration-scope"><img alt="celestron-nexstar-8se-telescope-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/celestron-nexstar-8se-telescope-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Vivitar Viv TELMIC 20 Beginner's Refractor Telescope Kit with Tripod](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Telescope+For+Beginners?utm\_term=vivitar-viv-telmic-20-beginners-refractor-telescope-kit-with-tripod)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Telescope+For+Beginners?utm_term=vivitar-viv-telmic-20-beginners-refractor-telescope-kit-with-tripod"><img alt="vivitar-viv-telmic-20-refractor-telescope-20x-30x-40x-with-tripod-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vivitar-viv-telmic-20-refractor-telescope-20x-30x-40x-with-tripod-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a curious amateur astronomer, I was intrigued by the Vivitar Viv TELMIC 20 Refractor Telescope. I had heard that it was an affordable option for beginners, so I decided to give it a try. 

Upon opening the package, I was initially impressed by the lightweight and compact design of the telescope. It was portable and easy to carry around, making it convenient for on-the-go stargazing. However, my enthusiasm took a nosedive when I actually put the telescope to use. 

First, the eyepieces felt cheap and of poor quality. The 20x, 30x, and 40x magnification options did not offer much clarity, and the images were distorted and blurry. I found myself straining my eyes to make any sense of what I was looking at, which left me feeling sore and disheartened. 

Furthermore, the tripod that came with the telescope was not sturdy enough to provide stable support. When trying to make adjustments, the telescope would wobble and shake, making it challenging to obtain a clear view of the celestial objects. 

In addition, the built-in compass was a nice feature, but it felt tacked on and was not a major selling point for me. The focus length of 170mm also seemed to be on the shorter side, which may not have allowed for a more in-depth exploration of the cosmos. 

Despite the microscope being included in the set, I had no interest in using it as the reviews suggested the instrument was of poor quality. With this product, it really felt like I was getting what I paid for – a cheap, poorly made telescope that failed to deliver the experience I had hoped for. 

In conclusion, while the Vivitar Viv TELMIC 20 Refractor Telescope was an affordable option for amateur astronomers, it did not meet my expectations and left me wishing I had invested in something of higher quality. I would not recommend this telescope for those seeking a satisfying stargazing experience. 


### [Beginner Starter Telescope for Kids and Amateur Astronomers](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Telescope+For+Beginners?utm\_term=beginner-starter-telescope-for-kids-and-amateur-astronomers)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Telescope+For+Beginners?utm_term=beginner-starter-telescope-for-kids-and-amateur-astronomers"><img alt="telescope-for-kids-with-tripod-40mm-beginner-telescope-with-30x-magnification-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/telescope-for-kids-with-tripod-40mm-beginner-telescope-with-30x-magnification-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Kids Telescope with Tripod by Hey! Play! , and let me tell you, it was quite an experience. I've had some fun using it with my kids during nighttime stargazing sessions. The first thing that caught my eye was the 30x magnification, which had me excited to explore the night sky. 

One feature that stood out was the adjustable tripod, which was easy to extend and reached the perfect height for my little astronomers. And, as a bonus, the telescope itself was pretty lightweight, making it a breeze to carry it around. 

However, I must admit that there was a downside to this telescope. While the magnification was impressive, getting a clear and focused view of the celestial bodies was quite challenging. We often had to fiddle with the focusing knob, trying to find the right spot. Despite this, the kids still found it quite entertaining. 

Another issue was the sturdiness of the telescope. After a few uses, one of the legs on the tripod broke, which was disappointing. Thankfully, the kids were able to continue using it, but it did make me wonder about the quality of the product. 

Overall, the Kids Telescope with Tripod by Hey! Play! is a decent choice for entry-level stargazers. While it may not offer the clearest views, it's a fun and affordable way to introduce kids to the wonders of astronomy.

### [Budget-Friendly Celestron StarSense Explorer LT 80AZ Refractor Telescope](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Telescope+For+Beginners?utm\_term=budget-friendly-celestron-starsense-explorer-lt-80az-refractor-telescope)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Telescope+For+Beginners?utm_term=budget-friendly-celestron-starsense-explorer-lt-80az-refractor-telescope"><img alt="celestron-starsense-explorer-lt-80az-refractor-telescope-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/celestron-starsense-explorer-lt-80az-refractor-telescope-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Exploring the night sky just got a whole lot easier and more exciting with the Celestron StarSense Explorer LT 80AZ Refractor Telescope. Imagine being a total beginner, with no telescope experience whatsoever, and being able to navigate through the depths of the universe effortlessly. This cutting-edge technology uses your smartphone to analyze star patterns overhead, effectively calculating its position in real-time. No more complicated procedures or lengthy set-ups; the StarSense Explorer app generates a list of objects that are currently visible, allowing you to view planets, brighter nebulae and galaxies, star clusters, and double stars - all from the comfort of your city - or even darker skies for some stunning deep sky objects.

### [Celestron StarSense Explorer 10" Dobsonian Smartphone Telescope - Expertly Guided Stargazing for Beginners](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Telescope+For+Beginners?utm\_term=celestron-starsense-explorer-10-dobsonian-smartphone-telescope-expertly-guided-stargazing-for-beginners)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Telescope+For+Beginners?utm_term=celestron-starsense-explorer-10-dobsonian-smartphone-telescope-expertly-guided-stargazing-for-beginners"><img alt="celestron-starsense-explorer-10-dobsonian-smartphone-telescope-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/celestron-starsense-explorer-10-dobsonian-smartphone-telescope-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

There's something magical about gazing up at the night sky and exploring the stars, planets, and galaxies that surround us – and with the Celestron StarSense Explorer 10" Dobsonian, I've found a telescope that makes this experience even more enchanting. 

One of the things that stood out right away was the ease of setup. Even though I was a beginner, the provided instructions made it simple to assemble the telescope and get it ready for stargazing.

But the true star of the show is the StarSense Explorer app. It's a game-changer in the world of amateur stargazing, providing a guided tour of the night sky right at your fingertips. I was amazed at how quickly I could locate faint, deep-sky objects and see them in greater detail than ever before. And the smartphone dock integrated seamlessly with the telescope, making it incredibly user-friendly. 

Of course, no product is perfect, and there were a couple of minor drawbacks. The 25mm Plössl eyepiece that comes with the telescope is a bit too low magnification for my taste, and I found myself wishing for a more powerful eyepiece. Additionally, while the Dobsonian base is sturdy, I would have appreciated some smoother altitude adjustment for a more precise tracking experience. 

Overall, though, the Celestron StarSense Explorer 10" Dobsonian has far outweighed any minor drawbacks, providing me with a truly unforgettable stargazing experience. And with the added perks of the included Observer's Map of The Moon and Moon Filter, I'm excited to explore even more of the cosmos with this amazing telescope. 


### [Affordable Juno 50mm Telescope with Hard Case and Magnification of 28.8x](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Telescope+For+Beginners?utm\_term=affordable-juno-50mm-telescope-with-hard-case-and-magnification-of-28-8x)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Telescope+For+Beginners?utm_term=affordable-juno-50mm-telescope-with-hard-case-and-magnification-of-28-8x"><img alt="discovery-juno-50mm-telescope-with-hard-case-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/discovery-juno-50mm-telescope-with-hard-case-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Affordable National Geographic Reflecting Telescope](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Telescope+For+Beginners?utm\_term=affordable-national-geographic-reflecting-telescope)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Telescope+For+Beginners?utm_term=affordable-national-geographic-reflecting-telescope"><img alt="national-geographic-114mm-reflecting-telescope-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/national-geographic-114mm-reflecting-telescope-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try out the 114mm Reflecting Telescope from National Geographic. At first, I was a bit hesitant, considering the low-quality reviews I had heard. But it turned out to be a surprisingly enjoyable experience. 

First off, the telescope was surprisingly easy to set up, with minimal hassle and no complex instructions. That being said, the instructional video provided did little to clear up any confusion, leaving me to rely on my intuition for assembly. 

Once I got everything put together, the telescope was lightweight and portable, which was a major plus given its size. The carbon fiber wrap added an elegant touch, making the telescope look more premium than its price point. 

As for the viewing experience, the two Plossl eyepieces provided excellent definition and contrast. I was able to get some great views of the moon, planets, and even a few bright deep-sky objects. However, the focal length of 500mm made it harder to find and observe these objects compared to a shorter focal length telescope. 

The red dot viewfinder and astronomy software were convenient additions, but in my experience, they were not essential. The same goes for the smartphone camera adapter, which worked well but I never really found myself relying on it for capturing pictures. 

Unfortunately, the 114mm Reflecting Telescope was not without its drawbacks. The alt-azimuth mount, although sturdy, had a bit of play to it which made focusing on objects somewhat difficult. Also, the tripod was rather flimsy and didn't seem to hold up well in even the slightest breeze. 

Overall, I would say that the National Geographic 114mm Reflecting Telescope is a decent option for anyone interested in stargazing on a budget. While it does have its quirks, the telescope manages to provide a decent viewing experience and is fairly easy to set up and use. Just don't expect it to be a top-of-the-line telescope. 


### [Galileo Table-Top Telescope with Easy-to-Use Mount for Beginners](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Telescope+For+Beginners?utm\_term=galileo-table-top-telescope-with-easy-to-use-mount-for-beginners)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Telescope+For+Beginners?utm_term=galileo-table-top-telescope-with-easy-to-use-mount-for-beginners"><img alt="galileo-table-top-dobsonian-telescope-with-smartphone-adapter-black-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/galileo-table-top-dobsonian-telescope-with-smartphone-adapter-black-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Galileo Table-Top Dobsonian Telescope with Smartphone Adapter, a fantastic addition to any beginner's stargazing arsenal. The telescope's 500mm x 80mm Optical Tube Assembly and easy-to-use Dobsonian mount are both handsomely crafted in a matte black finish. Standing at just over a foot tall with a diameter base of the same size, this telescope is incredibly portable, making it perfect for those on the go. 

My experience with the Galileo Table-Top Dobsonian Telescope has been nothing short of impressive. Equipped with two eyepieces, a 1" 6mm and a 1" 20mm, the telescope offers a versatile viewing experience. The telescope's smartphone adapter is a fantastic feature that allows you to capture breathtaking images of celestial objects. 

While the Altazimuth Mount requires some manual adjustment to achieve the perfect alignment, once you've got it right, the results are awe-inspiring. I wholeheartedly recommend this telescope to anyone looking to explore the wonders of the night sky.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Telescope+For+Beginners?utm_term=celestron-starsense-explorer-dx-130az-beginner-telescope"><img alt="celestron-starsense-explorer-dx-130az-130mm-f-5-az-reflector-telescope-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/celestron-starsense-explorer-dx-130az-130mm-f-5-az-reflector-telescope-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Celestron StarSense Explorer DX 130AZ telescope is a game-changer for beginner astronomers. As a long-time stargazer, I've tried many telescopes over the years, and this one has been a breath of fresh air. The best part? It lets me use my smartphone to guide me through the night sky, making it incredibly easy to find and explore celestial objects. 

The StarSense Explorer app is a real marvel, using my phone's camera to analyze star patterns overhead and calculate the telescope's position in real-time. It automatically generates a list of visible objects, so I never have to feel lost or frustrated trying to locate specific targets. I've been able to view planets, brighter nebulae, galaxies, star clusters, and even double stars from my city, and the app's accuracy has made the experience genuinely enjoyable. 

The 130mm reflector telescope itself is a solid piece of equipment, with enough light-gathering ability to view a wide range of celestial objects. The manual altazimuth mount is smooth and easy to use, with dual-axis slow-motion controls that make it simple to align the telescope with the on-screen arrows. 

However, the telescope isn't without its drawbacks. The included accessories, like the 1.25" eyepieces, could be of higher quality, and the ALT-AZ tripod feels a bit flimsy. I had to call Celestron for a replacement part, but their customer service was quick and helpful.

### What is the difference between an altazimuth and an Equatorial mount?

The primary difference between an altazimuth and an equatorial mount lies in how they move and the level of accuracy they provide in keeping the telescope aligned with the celestial objects you are observing. Both systems offer easy adjustability for panning and tilting, but they differ in how accurately they maintain the telescope's orientation. 

An altazimuth mount is simpler in design, providing smooth and easy movement in both the altitude (up and down) and azimuth (left and right) directions. This mount makes it simple to view objects at different elevations and positions in the sky, making it a suitable choice for beginners who are not overly concerned with maintaining exact alignment or high-precision tracking. However, for more advanced amateur astronomers seeking to track and photograph deep sky objects, an Equatorial mount might be a better option. 


### What is an Equatorial mount?

An Equatorial mount is a type of telescope mount that offers more precise and accurate alignment with celestial objects than an altazimuth mount. The mount's key innovation involves a counterweight system, which allows the telescope to rotate around a single, fixed point at the top of the mount, resembling the Earth's North Pole. This design allows for easy and accurate polar alignment, which in turn enables accurate tracking of celestial objects as they move across the sky throughout the night. 

Several different types of Equatorial mounts are available, such as the German, English, and Italian designs, each offering different levels of performance, complexity, and affordability. For beginners, a good starting point might be a fork-mount Equatorial, such as the Celestron NexStar 102SLX, which offers easy setup, use, and maintenance without sacrificing too much tracking accuracy. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Telescope+For+Beginners"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Telescope-For-Beginners-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Telescope-For-Beginners-6" height="540"></a></div>


### What accessories should I get with my telescope?

There are several accessories that can enhance your telescopic experience and complement your new beginner telescope. One crucial accessory to consider is a solid star map or a stargazing app to help you locate and identify objects in the night sky easily. Another helpful accessory is a red-light headlamp to maintain your night vision while handling the telescope controls and adjusting the eyepieces. 

Additionally, a sturdy tripod or heavy-duty mount is essential to ensure your telescope remains stable during observation. Depending on your interests, you might also consider purchasing a camera adapter for capturing photos of celestial objects or an astrophotography kit to dive into that aspect of the hobby. Lastly, investing in more eyepieces with different magnifications can enable you to explore your new telescope thoroughly and achieve better depth of view for various objects. 


### How can I choose the right eyepiece?

Choosing the right eyepiece involves understanding the magnification preferences of the user and the characteristics of the telescope being used. As a beginner, you should focus on eyepieces with a magnification range of 25 to 35 times or more for a larger-aperture telescope, and 8 to 10 times magnification for a smaller one (70-80mm). 

The eyepiece's focal length plays a key role in determining magnification. For example, a 10mm eyepiece with a 1500mm telescope will result in a magnification of around 150x. Remember that the lower the power eyepiece, the wider the field of view, which is beneficial for observing large objects such as the Milky Way or the Andromeda galaxy. High-power eyepieces (e. g. , 2mm to 3mm) offer greater image resolution and are ideal for exploring more detailed objects, like planetary nebulae and supernovae, but they provide a narrower field of view.
