### [A Pregnancy Journal to Cherish Every Moment - Sweet Beginning Memory Book](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Pregnancy+Journals?utm\_term=a-pregnancy-journal-to-cherish-every-moment-sweet-beginning-memory-book)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Pregnancy+Journals?utm_term=a-pregnancy-journal-to-cherish-every-moment-sweet-beginning-memory-book"><img alt="keepsake-pregnancy-journal-to-cherish-forever-a-pregnancy-book-to-capture-every-milestone-of-mom-bab-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/keepsake-pregnancy-journal-to-cherish-forever-a-pregnancy-book-to-capture-every-milestone-of-mom-bab-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a new mom, I always cherished moments from my pregnancy journey. Entering the world of parenthood is like capturing lightening in a bottle; memories fade fast, and this keeper journal captures it all perfectly. Its simple design with modern aesthetics fits right into the hands of a pregnant woman. I loved the photo spaces dedicated specifically to sonograms, baby bump, and other special moments. And the ample writing space gave me the chance to pen down my thoughts, experiences, and emotions like never before. 

I also appreciated the weekly structure of the journal, which allowed me to track my pregnancy milestones without demanding too much of my energy or time. It was a delight to see how my pregnancy transformed week by week - from the first symptoms to the ever-growing baby bump. 

Moreover, the lininen cover adds a touch of style and elegance to this memory book. I adore how it has evolved from just a journal into a precious keepsake for our baby's first nine months. And its spiral-bound design ensures that each page lays flat, making it super convenient to jot down memories or flip through past entries. 

However, if there were any downsides, I would have appreciated more prompts or questions to help guide the user during their journal entries. For example, a simple "Looking back at this week, what made you excited? " could have enriched the journey. 

Despite the slight drawback, Sweet Beginning was a joyous and mindful part of my pregnancy experience. For any expectant mom or mom in waiting, this journal offers the perfect outlet to capture and cherish every precious milestone of your baby's nine-month journey. 


### [Oh Baby! Pregnancy Planner & Tracker: A Journey from Bump to Baby](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Pregnancy+Journals?utm\_term=oh-baby-pregnancy-planner-tracker-a-journey-from-bump-to-baby)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Pregnancy+Journals?utm_term=oh-baby-pregnancy-planner-tracker-a-journey-from-bump-to-baby"><img alt="oh-baby-pregnancy-planner-track-pregnancy-from-bump-to-baby-journal-week-by-week-guide-to-childbirth-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/oh-baby-pregnancy-planner-track-pregnancy-from-bump-to-baby-journal-week-by-week-guide-to-childbirth-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

In my quest for a perfect planning companion during pregnancy, I stumbled upon the Oh Baby! Pregnancy Planner. This delightful book promised to cater to every need and milestone of pregnancy, from the joyous moment of learning the news to the excited preparation for the final months. 

One of the most helpful features I found in this planner was the weekly checklists and to-do lists. It kept me organized and feeling prepared for every stage of pregnancy. The doctor and prenatal appointment tracker provided a reassuring sense of control as well, ensuring I never missed any vital appointments. 

However, the highlight of this planner was the fetal movement tracker. It prompted me to jot down my baby's kicks and movements, creating a tangible connection between us even before I saw him or her in person. 

While I didn't use the baby names section extensively, it offered a fun touch to the otherwise functional planner. The baby shower memories section reminded me of the love and support surrounding me during that special day. 

The bonus 5-week meal planner was an unexpected and helpful addition, providing guidance through the dietary changes and health-conscious choices that come with pregnancy. 

Overall, the Oh Baby! Pregnancy Planner was more than just a journal – it was a companion and a reminder of the unforgettable journey ahead. While it may not have been perfect, it certainly left an imprint on my pregnancy experience.

### [Craft Your Pregnancy Memories: Beautiful Pregnancy Journal and Workbook](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Pregnancy+Journals?utm\_term=craft-your-pregnancy-memories-beautiful-pregnancy-journal-and-workbook)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Pregnancy+Journals?utm_term=craft-your-pregnancy-memories-beautiful-pregnancy-journal-and-workbook"><img alt="pregnancy-journal-pregnancy-journal-workbook-notebook-in-6x9-format-120-pages-to-write-in-with-appoi-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/pregnancy-journal-pregnancy-journal-workbook-notebook-in-6x9-format-120-pages-to-write-in-with-appoi-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a mom-to-be, I searched for a journal to document my pregnancy journey and landed on this one. The cover is undeniably beautiful, but unfortunately, the contents fell short of my expectations. With only one page dedicated to an ultrasound picture, I found myself having to flip through pages to save my favorite moments. 

The setup for each week felt excessive, especially with questions about the baby's belly size, weight, and various food preferences. It seemed like most of these prompts ended up being irrelevant to me since my cravings and aversions didn't change much week to week. These wasted spaces could have been better utilized with more practical checklists or prompts. 

Additionally, the page dedicated to appointments and medications didn't resonate with me. I didn't see the significance of recording the specific dates and doses of my appointments and medications postpartum - it'll never be something I'd want to look back on. 

Overall, this pregnancy journal felt more like a disappointment than a source of joy. While it has the potential to be a perfect gift, I wouldn't recommend it to someone planning to relive their pregnancy journey.

I recently tried out the Pregnancy Journal by Paper Peony Press and I must say, it's a game-changer for expectant mothers. As a first-time mom, I found it incredibly easy to use. The weekly layout allowed me to keep track of my progress, from my mood to my energy levels, throughout all three trimesters. The gender-neutral design made it perfect for sharing with my partner. 

What really stood out for me was the premium linen-wrapped cover with timeless gold-foil embossing - it felt so luxurious and sophisticated. I loved the guided writing prompts that helped me document the most important moments and milestones in our journey. 

However, I did find that the journal had a lot of empty space, which could have been utilized for more prompts or ideas. Also, it would have been nice to have a section specifically for tracking pregnancy symptoms, as they can be very specific and helpful to monitor. 

Overall, the Pregnancy Journal by Paper Peony Press is a fantastic tool for documenting your pregnancy journey and managing all the details in one place. It's an invaluable resource for first-time moms and experienced moms alike!
