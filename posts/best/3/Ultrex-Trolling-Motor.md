### Power

One of the primary factors to consider when purchasing an Ultrex trolling motor is power. The motor's power rating is typically measured in pounds of thrust, ranging from 30-112 pounds of thrust. The more powerful the motor, the more control you have over the boat, especially in rough waters or strong winds. As a general rule, choose a motor that provides a thrust rating approximately 10-15% more than the combined weight of the boat and its equipment. 


### Control

The control features of an Ultrex trolling motor can significantly improve your boating experience. Look for features such as 8- or 10-speed forward and reverse control, digital speed control, and shift-on-the-fly technology which allows you to change gears easily without having to reverse while doing so. These features enhance the motor's performance and ensure a smooth, safe, and efficient ride.

### Shaft Length

The shaft length of the Ultrex trolling motor plays an important role in determining the motor's functionality and efficiency. Most motors come in multiple shaft lengths ranging from 36-72 inches. Consider the depth of the water in your fishing location, as well as the overall size and weight of your boat, when choosing the appropriate shaft length. A longer shaft is better for deep waters, while a shorter shaft is ideal for shallow areas. Additionally, consider the propeller size and whether it will fit the motor's shaft length.
