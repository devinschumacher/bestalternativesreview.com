However, I did encounter a minor issue with the screws in the L-shaped portion – they could use a little extra support to prevent it from slipping out. 

Another thing to note is the manual's instructions for English speakers. They were confusing and required me to search online for clarification. Despite this, the customer support was responsive and helpful when I did reach out for assistance. 

Overall, the FEZiBO L-Shaped Corner Desk is a great value for the price, providing a versatile and practical workspace solution.
