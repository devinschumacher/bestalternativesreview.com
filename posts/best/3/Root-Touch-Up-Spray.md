<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Root+Touch+Up+Spray?utm_term=dark-brown-root-touch-up-spray-for-brush-on-application"><img alt="salon-on-5th-ave-brush-on-root-concealer-dark-brown-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/salon-on-5th-ave-brush-on-root-concealer-dark-brown-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

A few weeks ago, I decided to try the Salon on 5th Ave Brush on Root Concealer in Dark-Brown. I was intrigued by the quick and easy application, as well as the long-lasting color the brand promised. 

From the moment I opened the tube, I could tell this product was easy to handle. One quick spray and I had the perfect amount of color in just one brush stroke. The drying time was impressive too! My roots were covered in under 5 minutes, and there was no messy residue left behind. 

After using it for a week or so, I've noticed that the color really does stay put until it's washed out. It's perfect for those in-between hair appointments or to quickly touch up stubborn gray hairs. 

However, I must mention one downside - the brush is not the best quality. It did leave a few hairs a bit damp, but a quick blow dry sorted it out. 

Overall, I would recommend the Salon on 5th Ave Brush on Root Concealer Dark-Brown. It's quick, easy, and provides the perfect amount of coverage for those in need of a temporary root touch-up. Just make sure to use a good-quality brush for the best results.

The scent is pleasant, but as someone who doesn't usually use hair products, it's a bit overpowering for me personally.

One of the things I loved about RETOUCH. ME was its quick-drying property that didn't break down or leave any residue on my hair. While it effectively concealed my roots, I did notice that it left my hair feeling a little sticky. I hope this doesn't become a recurring issue with future applications. 

Overall, the product delivers on its promise of easy, long-lasting color touch-ups. It even had a pleasant scent, which was an added bonus. Although there was a slight downside with the stickiness and nozzle situation, I would definitely recommend anyone who needs an effective and convenient root touch-up spray to give RETOUCH. ME a try.

## Buyer's Guide

When it comes to root touch-up sprays, there are several factors you should consider to ensure you get the best product for your needs. In this buyer's guide, we'll cover some essential features, considerations, and advice to help you make an informed decision when purchasing a root touch-up spray. 


### Important Features of Root Touch-Up Sprays

1. Color Selection: Look for a root touch-up spray that offers a wide range of colors to match your hair's natural shade or the desired outcome. This will ensure a natural-looking finish and help you achieve the desired color result. Most root touch-up sprays come in various shades of brown, black, and blonde, but some even offer options for red, gray, or highlights.

### Considerations Before Purchasing a Root Touch-Up Spray

2. Permanence: Some root touch-up sprays are designed for temporary or semi-permanent coverage, while others offer long-lasting, permanent results. Consider your personal preference and the level of maintenance you're willing to commit to when making your decision. If you prefer a more permanent solution, look for a spray with a color deposit formula that can help blend and cover gray roots more effectively. 


### General Advice for Using Root Touch-Up Sprays

3. Application Technique: To achieve a natural-looking and blended outcome, it's essential to use the spray as directed. Typically, you'll want to apply it over a dry scalp and onto the roots only. Use a thin layer to start, and you can always add more if needed. It's also important not to overapply, as this can lead to unwanted buildup or a visible texture.

### Maintaining and Extending the Life of Your Root Touch-Up Spray

4. Maintenance Schedule: To get the most out of your root touch-up spray, consider the maintenance schedule for your hair type. If you have fine or thin hair, you might need to reapply more frequently than someone with thicker, coarser hair. Additionally, be sure to use a gentle shampoo and conditioner to help maintain the color and prevent buildup that can shorten the life of the product.

###  What is Root Touch Up Spray?

Root Touch Up Spray is a hair coloring product designed to temporarily cover the roots of your hair between salon visits. This innovative spray works by instantly blending the synthetic roots with your natural hair color, making it appear as if you've had a fresh salon appointment. Best of all, it provides a more natural-looking and convenient alternative to traditional hair chalk and messy powder-based touch-up products. 

Root Touch Up Spray is a relatively new product on the market, but it has quickly gained popularity for its ease of use, affordability, and effectiveness. Designed to match a wide variety of hair colors, this product offers a quick solution for those who want a hassle-free color touch-up in between professional hair appointments. 


### How does it work?

Root Touch Up Spray works by utilizing a blend of synthetic pigments and polymers that mimic the appearance of real hair color. The pigment particles in the spray are specifically designed to bond with the natural oils and oily deposits found on the hair shaft. When the spray is applied, the pigment particles in the formula create a thin layer of color that seamlessly blends with the hair, making it look like your roots have been retouched by a professional. The result is a natural-looking, temporary hair color that lasts throughout the day until it's washed out. 

Additionally, the product's applicator nozzle has been designed for precise and easy application. To use, simply shake the can well before spraying, hold it 12-15 inches away from your hair, and lightly mist the root area. Once applied, you can let it dry naturally or use a blow dryer on low heat to speed up the process. The dry time usually takes around 10-15 minutes. When you're ready, you can gently comb your hair to blend the color further into your natural hair, giving it a more seamless and natural appearance.

### Is it messy to use?

Compared to traditional hair chalk or messy powder-based touch-up products, Root Touch Up Spray is relatively non-messy to use. The lightweight applicator doesn't require any rubbing, and the pigment particles bond with the hair's natural oils and oily deposits, making them less likely to get on your skin or clothes. Additionally, the product is formulated to prevent smudging, ensuring that your touch-up looks neat and tidy throughout the day. 

If you're concerned about any potential messiness or staining from the product, it's recommended to wear an old t-shirt and apply Touch Up Spray over the sink or in the shower to minimize the risk of unwanted staining on your clothes or towels. Removal can be easily done by thoroughly washing your hands post-application, as many people experience a temporary pigment transfer. 


### Which hair colors does Root Touch Up Spray match?

Root Touch Up Spray comes in a range of shades to perfectly match most natural hair colors. These include: Light Blonde, Medium Blonde, Dark Blonde, Light Brown, Medium Brown, Dark Brown, Red, Black, and Lilac. However, if your hair color falls outside of these shades, it may be challenging to find an exact match. In some cases, you might need to blend colors or experiment with different application methods to achieve the desired effect. 

It's essential to select the most closely matched shade when choosing the product. Applying a shade that's too light or too dark might result in an unnatural appearance, so use your best judgment based on your hair color and consider getting a friend's opinion or asking a professional for advice to achieve the best touch-up result. If this product doesn't meet your expectations, consider using a hair toner or temporary hair color spray for a more precise match.

### Is Root Touch Up Spray safe for all hair types?

Root Touch Up Spray is typically safe for all hair types. However, it's essential to do a patch test before using the product to ensure that you don't have an adverse reaction to the formula. Applying a small amount of spray to the inside of your wrist or behind your ear several hours before using the product will help you determine if you're sensitive or allergy-prone to its ingredients. 

Additionally, the product's instructions recommend avoiding the use around the face, ears, and eyebrows. Direct application to any sensitive skin areas should be avoided, as reactions could occur. Always opt for a natural, gentle approach, and remember that you can wash the product out if you're uncomfortable with it or noticing adverse effects in your hair or scalp. 


### Is Root Touch Up Spray washable or permanent?

Root Touch Up Spray is not a permanent hair color. It's designed to provide a quick, temporary solution for root touch-ups and can be washed out with repeated shampooing. The life of the product on your hair varies depending on several factors such as your hair type, the color of your hair, and how well the product is applied. Generally, it lasts around 1-2 days before needing a touch-up. 

If you're concerned about how long the product will last, note that it may not perform as well on certain hair types or when applied under certain environmental conditions. Some factors, like humidity or sweat, can affect the durability and intensity of the color. To ensure the product holds up well throughout the day, consider using a gentle dry shampoo or a hair product specifically designed to hold color in place when styling.
