The first thing that caught my eye was the powder-coating in matte black. It gave the mount a sleek, sophisticated look that would complement any room decor. But the real magic happens when you start to use it. 

This mount is capable of holding TVs from 47" to 86", with a weight capacity of up to 21 lbs. It extends 15.5" from the wall while providing strong support for larger and heavier TVs. The swivel and tilting capabilities ensure you find the ideal viewing positions possible. I found myself experimenting with different positions to find the perfect angle, and it didn't disappoint.

However, there was one thing I found a bit frustrating. The full motion capabilities required some getting used to. It's important to find the right balance between movement and stability, especially when adjusting the tilt and swivel angles. But with a little practice, it became second nature. 

All in all, I would highly recommend this Atlantic Full Motion TV Mount. It's sturdy, easy to assemble, and offers the perfect viewing angles. Plus, it's stylish and space-saving. Your TV will never look better.

## Buyer's Guide

When it comes to mounting a TV on the wall, there are numerous options available in the market. In this buyer's guide, we will discuss the essential features, considerations, and general advice to help you make an informed decision when selecting a TV wall mount. 


### Design and Construction

The design and construction of a TV wall mount play a crucial role in its stability, ease of installation, and compatibility with different TV sizes and weights. Look for a mount that is built with high-quality materials, such as steel or aluminum, and has a robust construction to ensure maximum durability. Additionally, consider the design aspects, such as the aesthetic appeal, ease of installation, and compatibility with the TV's shape and size. 


### Type of Wall Mount

There are three main types of TV wall mounts: fixed, tilting, and full-motion. Fixed mounts are the most basic, providing a secure position for your TV but offering no adjustability. Tilting mounts allow for minor angle adjustments, while full-motion mounts offer the most flexibility, with the ability to move the TV in multiple directions. Choose a mount type based on your viewing preferences and requirements. 


### Vesa Compatibility

VEGA (Video Electronics Standards Association) is an organization that sets industry standards for TV mounting systems. VESA compatibility is essential for ensuring that your TV can be securely mounted without damaging it or the mount. Check the VESA compatibility of both the TV and the mount before making a purchase. 


### Installation and Mounting

Installation and mounting are critical aspects of purchasing a TV wall mount. Consider the ease of installation, weight capacity, and compatibility with different wall types. Some wall mounts require professional installation, while others can be installed by yourself. Additionally, make sure the mount is compatible with your wall type, whether it's drywall, concrete, or brick. 


## FAQ


### Which wall mount is perfect for a big TV?

Opt for a robust wall mount capable of holding the weight of a large-sized TV. Search for a mount with a capacity of at least 75-100 pounds and a reliable structure. The Sanus VW520B1 24-Inch Adjustable Wall Mount is a popular option for large TVs as it enables height and tilt adjustments. 

Moreover, it's necessary to pay attention to the style of installation — a set mount might not be appropriate for big TVs, as it would require drilling into the wall. A full-motion wall mount provides more adaptability in placement and adjustment, making it a better option for larger TVs. For instance, the Mounting Dream MD282B 28-Inch Swivel Wall Mount offers rotating functionality that allows simple alterations. 


### What is the distinction between a fixed and a full-motion wall mount?

A fixed wall mount is intended for stationary placement and offers minimal modification choices. Typically, it has a single point of connection to the wall and is ideal for TVs in smaller living spaces. A full-motion wall mount, on the other hand, offers more versatility in positioning your TV. It generally has multiple adaptable points that allow the TV to tilt, swivel, or extend from the wall. This type of mount is perfect for larger TVs and rooms with broader layouts. 

Additionally, full-motion wall mounts offer enhanced convenience for viewers who prefer not to sit directly in front of the TV. They can be adjusted to accommodate different seating positions and diminish glare from windows or light fixtures. Furthermore, some full-motion wall mounts feature built-in cable management systems to keep your wires organized and concealed. 


### Can I set up the wall mount myself?

Yes, many wall mounts can be installed by homeowners with basic DIY expertise. It's vital to read the manufacturer's instructions carefully and ensure you possess the required tools and supplies. Generally, mounting a wall mount involves drilling into the wall and securing the mount with screws or anchors. Certain mounts might also necessitate additional brackets or supports to be attached to the TV's back. 

If you're uncertain about the installation procedure, consider hiring a professional installer to guarantee the job is done correctly and securely. Additionally, a professional can assist you in selecting the right mount for your TV and living space and provide guidance on cable management and other essential aspects. 


### Do I need a special TV for a wall mount?

Most contemporary TVs are compatible with wall mounts designed for flat-panel TVs. Wall mounts usually come with pre-drilled screw holes that match the TV's VESA (Video Electronics Standards Association) mounting pattern. Make sure to verify the VESA measurements of your TV and ascertain that the wall mount you are considering is suitable before making a purchase. 

For special cases such as curved TVs or TVs with specific mounting requirements, you might need to research and purchase a mount explicitly developed to accommodate your TV's unique features. Contact the manufacturer or a professional installer to determine the most appropriate mount for your specific TV model. 


### What are the benefits of a low-profile wall mount?

Low-profile wall mounts are designed to be unobtrusive and minimally visible. They have a reduced profile when mounted on the wall, reducing the appearance of the mount and offering a neat, sleek look to the room. Low-profile mounts are ideal for viewers who prefer a more understated design in their living space. 

Moreover, low-profile mounts are generally simpler to install, as they require fewer components and tools. The minimal design also takes up less room, which can be beneficial in smaller living spaces. However, it's crucial to consider the weight and size of your TV when choosing a low-profile mount, as not all models are designed to support heavier or larger TVs. 


### How do I choose the ideal wall mount for my TV?

When selecting a wall mount, consider these factors: 
1) Type of TV (flat or curved), 2) VESA measurements (100x100, 200x200, etc. ), 3) Weight and size of the TV, 4) Mount type (fixed or full-motion), and 5) Additional features (cable management, low-profile design, etc. ). Examine the manufacturer's specifications to ensure compatibility with your TV model. 

Furthermore, consider your personal preferences and necessities, such as the demand for placement adaptability or simplicity of installation. Read customer reviews and consult with a professional installer to make an informed decision. It's essential to opt for the right wall mount for your TV to guarantee secure and safe installation while ensuring an optimal viewing experience.
