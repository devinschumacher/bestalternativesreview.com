When selecting a PVC pipe cutter, consider the following features to ensure the best fit for your requirements: 
1) Cutting length: PVC pipe cutters come in a range of cutting lengths, from small handheld models to larger benchtop units. Choose a cutting length that will best suit your needs without sacrificing portability if necessary. 2) Cutting capacity: Check the cutting capacity of the pipe cutter to ensure it can handle the diameter of the PVC pipes you plan to cut. Most models can cut pipes up to 1-1/2 or 2 inches in diameter, but some high-capacity models can handle larger pipes. 3) Material: PVC pipe cutters are typically constructed of steel or aluminum. Steel models may be more durable but heavier, while aluminum models are lighter and more cost-effective. 4) Safety features: Look for pipe cutters with safety features such as a guarded blade, non-slip handles, and locking mechanisms to prevent injuries during use. 


### Considerations

Before purchasing a PVC pipe cutter, consider the following factors to make the best choice for your project: 
1) Volume of cutting: If you need to cut a large number of pipes, you may want to invest in a more robust or higher-capacity model.

Look for lightweight and compact designs that can be easily stored and transported. 3) Ease of use: Choose a pipe cutter with a user-friendly design and easy-to-operate features.
