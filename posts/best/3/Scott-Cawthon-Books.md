The Silver Eyes by Scott Cawthon was a thrilling read for me. As a fan of the Five Nights at Freddy's games, I couldn't resist diving into this book that promised to fill in some gaps in the story. The book takes place ten years after the murders at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, and follows Charlie and her childhood friends as they revisit the abandoned pizza place on the anniversary of the event.

The descriptions of the animatronic mascots, now changed from their original forms, were both intriguing and unsettling. The story really immerses you in the world of the games and adds a new layer of depth to the lore. 

However, one thing I noticed was that the book assumes a certain level of knowledge about the games. If you're not familiar with the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise, some parts of the story might be confusing. I would recommend this book to fans of the games who are looking for more information about the world they love. 

Overall, The Silver Eyes was a fun and engaging read that added to my appreciation of the Five Nights at Freddy's universe. The detailed descriptions of the animatronics and the eerie atmosphere kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end.

### [Scott Cawthon's The Bones at Point No Point](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Scott+Cawthon+Books?utm\_term=scott-cawthons-the-bones-at-point-no-point)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Scott+Cawthon+Books?utm_term=scott-cawthons-the-bones-at-point-no-point"><img alt="the-bones-at-point-no-point-book-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/the-bones-at-point-no-point-book-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Apothecary Diaries 01: Manga Series by Scott Cawthon](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Scott+Cawthon+Books?utm\_term=apothecary-diaries-01-manga-series-by-scott-cawthon)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Scott+Cawthon+Books?utm_term=apothecary-diaries-01-manga-series-by-scott-cawthon"><img alt="the-apothecary-diaries-01-manga-book-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/the-apothecary-diaries-01-manga-book-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I had the pleasure of diving into The Apothecary Diaries 01, and I must say, it's more than just an anime for me now. The story is set in an era that resembles Ancient China, but with a touch of magic and mystery, which makes it more appealing. Our protagonist, Maomao, starts off as a humble servant with a knack for herbal medicine and eventually gets promoted to the role of food taster in the palace. Her life takes an unexpected twist, as she becomes entangled in the palace intrigues. 

The one aspect that stood out in my experience is the detailed illustrations by Nekokurage. The palace and its surrounding scenes are vividly depicted, and it feels as if you've walked right into a history book about Ancient China. The intricate clothing and background settings make the manga a visual treat. 

However, the story takes a bit of a mature turn when a scene involving Maomao and her fellow-ladies suggests a romantic encounter. Although the characters are fully clothed, the implication of their actions might not be suitable for younger audiences. 

Overall, The Apothecary Diaries 01 is a thrilling read with an interesting blend of comedy, mystery, and a hint of romance. The engaging plot is kept alive by engaging characters and breathtaking visuals. I can't wait to see what unfolds in the rest of the series.

The lessons in this book are applicable in various aspects of life, from business to personal relationships.

However, like any other product, it had its cons. The book I received was used, and its condition was not as good as I would have expected. The dust jacket was notably worn, and it seemed like it had been through many hands. Nevertheless, the content of the book made up for the minor imperfections. 

In summary, "Never Split the Difference" is a must-read for anyone who values effective communication, strategic negotiation, and making the most of every discussion.
