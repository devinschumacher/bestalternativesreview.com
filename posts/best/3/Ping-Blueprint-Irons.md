I found myself achieving higher ball flights and increased yardage with these irons compared to my previous set. 

One caveat: I did find that the vibration is a bit more pronounced with these irons, which may be off-putting to some golfers. However, for me, this did not detract significantly from my overall experience, and I quickly adapted to the new sensation. 

In summary, the Ping G430 Irons are a fantastic addition to any golfer's arsenal, offering a combination of distance, control, and forgiveness unlike any other iron I have used.
