### [Shark Matrix Robot Vacuum with Precision Mapping and Self-Cleaning Brushroll](https://serp.ly/amazon/Shark+Self+Cleaning+Vacuum?utm\_term=shark-matrix-robot-vacuum-with-precision-mapping-and-self-cleaning-brushroll)

I recently tried the Shark Matrix Robot Vacuum, and I must say, it's been quite the delight to have around the house. Being a pet owner, the self-cleaning brushroll immediately caught my attention, as it helped me tackle my pet hair woes. The suction is quite powerful, capturing even the tiniest specks of dirt and debris from my carpets and hardwood floors. 

One of the most impressive features of this vacuum is its precision mapping capabilities. It uses a grid to cover every inch of your home, ensuring no spot is left behind. The 360° LiDAR vision also allows the vacuum to detect and avoid obstacles in its path, making it perfect for homes with children and pets running around. 

The robot vacuum's ability to recharge and resume cleaning where it left off has been a lifesaver for me. It's convenient to not have to worry about the vacuum losing battery life mid-clean. The SharkClean app is user-friendly and allows you to schedule cleaning sessions, target specific rooms, and even use voice-activated assistants like Google Assistant or Alexa. 

However, there were a few cons I encountered. Despite the powerful suction, it sometimes struggled to pick up larger chunks of pet hair, leaving a few hair balls behind. It would be great to see an update in the future that can address this issue. Additionally, the vacuum's cleaning solution was neither included nor recommended, leaving me to search for an alternative. 

Overall, I'm happy with my experience using the Shark Matrix Robot Vacuum. It's a convenient, self-sufficient cleaning device that's been a big help in keeping my home tidy, especially for a pet owner like myself. It's definitely worth considering for those looking for a hands-free and efficient vacuuming solution.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Shark+Self+Cleaning+Vacuum?utm_term=the-shark-self-cleaning-upright-vacuum-with-duoclean-powerfins-by-az1810"><img alt="the-shark-vertex-speed-upright-vacuum-with-duoclean-powerfins-powered-lift-away-and-self-cleaning-br-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/the-shark-vertex-speed-upright-vacuum-with-duoclean-powerfins-powered-lift-away-and-self-cleaning-br-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently fell in love with my Shark Vertex Speed Vacuum. This powerful upright vacuum is fantastic for cleaning both hard floors and carpets, thanks to its DuoClean PowerFins technology. The combo of continuous cleaning contact and soft front roller provides deep carpet cleaning and hard floor engagement, meaning I don't miss a single dust particle. 

With its Active Glide technology, the vacuum glides smoothly on all surfaces while maintaining powerful suction, perfect for my daily cleaning routine. Additionally, the LED headlights help me spot hidden debris in various spaces around the house, a feature I appreciate. 

However, there are a few things that need improvement. Firstly, anti-allergen technologies could be better integrated to avoid releasing allergens back into the air. Secondly, the vacuum becomes a bit heavy after continuous use, making it challenging to maneuver.
