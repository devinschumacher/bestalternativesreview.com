But with this cleaner and polish, I've finally found a product that thoroughly cleans and leaves a protective barrier on the surface. 

I particularly appreciate that it's a pH neutral formula, which means it's gentle on my stainless steel while still being effective at removing dirt and grime.

However, the product did have a few downsides. The cleaner and polish had an unpleasant scent, which left me wondering about its environmental impact.

When I first encountered the Weiman Stainless Steel Wipes, I was both excited and a little uncertain. As someone who frequently uses stainless steel appliances in the kitchen, I was intrigued by the potential of cleaning and maintaining their shine with something more convenient than traditional cleaning methods. My initial skepticism quickly disappeared after giving these wipes a try. 

First impressions were positive, as the wipes are easy to unwrap from the resealable container and dispense. The dimensions are thoughtfully designed for flexibility while still providing ample cleaning surface. The pH neutral formula works effectively to clean, shine, and protect the stainless steel, leaving behind an invisible film that repels dust and dirt, preventing heavy build-up. 

As a user, I found these Weiman Stainless Steel Wipes to be efficient and noteworthy for their ability to remove fingerprints, watermarks, and grease without leaving any residue or streaks. However, there were a few minor downsides. The thinness of the wipes means they can't handle a very strong pressure or a deeply embedded stain, but their role as a daily cleaner outperformed my expectations. Although some may find the fragrance pleasant, others might consider it a drawback, but the scent was barely noticeable to me after just a few uses. 

In conclusion, these wipes are an excellent addition to any household with stainless steel appliances or accessories. Their convenient design and ability to restore shining finishes are highly appreciated. While there is still room for improvement in terms of stain removal or resistance to grease, the Weiman Stainless Steel Wipes prove to be a valuable and time-saving tool in the kitchen.
