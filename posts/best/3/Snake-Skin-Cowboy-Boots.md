I've had the pleasure of trying out the Roper Men's Peyton Python Exotic Western Boots, and let me tell you, they're quite the sight to behold.

The leather pull tabs and linings added bonus points, and I was impressed with the stitching pattern on the shaft. 

However, I couldn't say I was completely satisfied. The single stitch welt and the 3/4 welt sole nails and lemonwood pegs seemed a bit on the weaker side to me. I also found the REST removable insole a bit disappointing, as it felt a tad flimsy for my taste. But then again, it depends on individual comfort preferences. And yes, there was that unfortunate python skin issue mentioned in some reviews - something I hope gets addressed soon. Nevertheless, they're comfortable once on, and the Western heel adds a nice touch of cowboy charm.
