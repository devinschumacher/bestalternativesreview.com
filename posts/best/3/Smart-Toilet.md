I recently had the chance to try out the Woodbridge Intelligent toilet, and let me tell you, it's a game-changer. I've never been much of a fan of automatic flushing, but this one changed my mind. The foot sensor function is so convenient—I just had to give it a quick tap, and the toilet did the rest for me! 

One of my favorite features is the heated seat and warm air dryer. I can't tell you how cozy it feels after a chilly bathroom session. Plus, the water pressure is totally adjustable, so you can customize your wash to your liking. The fact that it's eco-friendly and uses filtered water is just the icing on the cake. 

However, there were a few minor issues I encountered. The auto-close and open feature is missing, which I found a bit disappointing. Also, the installation process could have been smoother, as it required a bit of elbow grease. But overall, I'm pretty impressed with this electric bidet toilet. It's sleek, modern, and sure to fit right in with your contemporary, transitional, or traditional bathroom theme.
