### [Stainless Steel Pizza Wheel by KitchenAid - Finger Safety Guard & Dishwasher-safe](https://serp.ly/amazon/Pizza+Cutter+Wheel?utm\_term=stainless-steel-pizza-wheel-by-kitchenaid-finger-safety-guard-dishwasher-safe)

You know the feeling when you're eagerly waiting for your oven-baked pizza pie, and finally, it's time to slice it up? The excitement turns into disappointment as the slicer skids along, barely slicing at all. This is where the KitchenAid Stainless Steel Pizza Wheel comes to the rescue. 

I'll be real with you - I was skeptical about how well the pizza wheel would work considering its compact size. But, to my surprise, the Stainless Steel Pizza Wheel performs exceptionally well. From the first slice I had, I could tell that something great was going on. This puppy slices in a matter of seconds, and the pizza evenly. It doesn't push the toppings forward instead of slicing them. It's like having a mini chefs in your kitchen! 

Using this pizza wheel is an absolute delight. The handle feels comfortable, and it's made with materials that give you a good grip, even with wet hands. The design is as practical as it is chic. The stainless steel material brings an element of durability, and thanks to the finger safety guard, there's no risk of accidentally cutting yourself. 

It's a dream to clean up after dinner. KitchenAid didn't just think about making a good pizza wheel, but also a hassle-free experience for you and me. It's dishwasher-friendly, which means you can easily toss it into the machine and forget it. 

However, I must admit there's a little bit of the 'too good to be true' feeling. There's a thin plastic protector on the blade, which feels a bit flimsy to me. Also, I'm not sure whether leaving it on the pizza while cutting or off before slicing would be safer. 

All in all, this small but mighty pizza wheel is a great addition to any kitchen. It's the perfect tool for handling pizza night, and it's built to last. It's simple, stylish, and most of all, it makes cutting up pizzas a piece of cake (or pizza, as the case may be).
