I recently had the chance to try out this spacious Extra Large Travel Backpack by Hanples on a trip. It's perfect for those who need a bit more room than a standard carry-on backpack, as it can expand to a capacious 40 liters! The zippers are durable, and the elastic, breathable sponge on the back makes it quite comfortable to wear, even on long walks. 

One of the highlights for me was the versatile port for charging and listening to music on my phone, which comes in handy during flights. Also, the backpack is waterproof and equipped with a wet and dry compartment, ensuring that your clothes stay fresh and dry on the go. 

However, one small downside is the absence of a charging cable and power bank, which would have made the charging port even more convenient. Overall, Hanples Extra Large Travel Backpack is a stylish and functional companion for all your travel needs.
