As a huge fan of baking, I recently invested in this small pie dish from the Casafina Cook & Host collection. As soon as I took it out of the box, the glossy white glaze caught my attention. It looked elegant and classy, perfect for any family gathering. 

The first time I used it, I baked a delicious pie for a dinner party. After the party, I had to wash up the dishes. To my surprise, the dish was remarkably easy to clean. The stain-resistant and chip-resistant features lived up to their promise. 

Being a busy cook, I sometimes throw my dishes in the microwave or the freezer. This pie dish is designed to handle those situations with ease. It's microwave-safe and freezer safe, so I can prep my meals ahead of time. 

The only downside I found was the need for hand washing. I prefer dishwashers for easy clean-ups, but this pie dish is not your typical dishwasher-safe item. Nevertheless, it's a small compromise considering the other pros. 

In conclusion, if you're looking for a stylish and functional pie dish, the Casafina Cook & Host Pie Dish Small is a great choice. Its glossy white finish, stain-resistant properties, and versatile use make it a must-have for any cook or host.

However, there were a couple of things that I found a bit frustrating. First, the lid doesn't fit snugly onto the dish, which makes storing the pie dish in the fridge a bit more challenging than I would have liked. Second, the lid has a number of large vent holes, which seemed unnecessary. While I understand the intention is to prevent condensation, it does limit its effectiveness when it comes to storing pies for an extended period.

### [The Pioneer Woman 9-inch Stoneware Pie Plate - Baking Perfection](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Pie+Dish?utm\_term=the-pioneer-woman-9-inch-stoneware-pie-plate-baking-perfection)

The sturdy stoneware construction ensures even heat distribution when you're cooking, leading to beautifully baked pies with a perfect texture. Additionally, the dish can easily handle high temperatures, both in the oven and the dishwasher, making it both safe and convenient to use. 

A major drawback, however, is that the dish has a larger capacity than standard glass pie plates, which can lead to overfilling and, in my experience, a much longer baking time. Despite its robust design, the large size may also make it harder to store in a smaller kitchen. 

I also recently encountered an issue with the dish when I used it for baking. It cracked in half after only a few uses, quite possibly due to its significant capacity. This has left me with concerns about the longevity of the product, despite its attractive design and top-notch performance. 

In conclusion, while I highly recommend The Pioneer Woman's 9-inch Stoneware Pie Dish for its beautiful design and exceptional cooking capabilities, its higher price compared to less durable alternatives and my personal experience with the dish cracking prematurely do cause some hesitation.

## Buyer's Guide

When it comes to baking pies, choosing the right pie dish is crucial to achieve the perfect result. In this buyer's guide, we will discuss important features, considerations, and general advice to help you find the best pie dish for your needs. 


### Sizes and Shapes

One of the primary factors to consider when selecting a pie dish is the size and shape of the dish. Common sizes range from 8-inch to 10-inch diameter with depths of about 1.5 to 2 inches. Shapes may include round, square, or rectangular dishes, depending on your desired pie style. Consider the size and shape that best suits your recipes and serving needs. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Pie+Dish"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Pie-Dish-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Pie-Dish-2" height="540"></a></div>


### Materials and Construction

The material of your pie dish will greatly impact its durability, heat resistance, and ease of use. Common materials include ceramic, glass, stainless steel, and aluminum. Ceramic and glass dishes are typically insulated to help retain heat, while metal dishes conduct heat more evenly. Stainless steel and aluminum dishes are lightweight and easy to clean, but may be more prone to scratching. Consider your personal preferences and the requirements of your recipes when choosing a material. 


### Preventing Stickiness

One common issue when baking pies is the sticking of the crust to the dish. To prevent this, look for pie dishes with a non-stick coating or those that can be easily rubbed with butter or oil before use. Another option is to use a removable-bottom pie dish, which allows for easy lifting and cleaning.

### Additional Features and Accessories

Some pie dishes come with additional features such as handles or fluted edges for an elegant presentation. Accessories like silicone mats or pie crust shields can also be helpful when baking pies. Consider these options when choosing a pie dish that maximizes your baking experience and results in a perfectly baked pie every time.

When it comes to pie dishes, you'll discover that there's a plethora of materials available, catering to all tastes and preferences. This diverse range includes options such as glass, ceramic, aluminum, and cast iron - each boasts its own unique set of benefits and drawbacks.


### How to Wisely Select Your Pie Dish Material

Determining the right material for your pie dish can be a crucial aspect of achieving the perfect bake.

### Viewing Made Simple: Glass Pie Dishes

In the world of baking, aesthetics can sometimes trump practicality. A delightful, glass pie dish provides the perfect opportunity for bakers to showcase their culinary creations in a visually appealing manner. While glass pie dishes do not boast the same level of heat retention as ceramic or metal alternatives, they still stand out as a popular choice.


### The Unique Charms of Cast Iron Pie Dishes

For those who value durability and versatility, cast iron pie dishes have long been a cherished choice. These dishes are not only heavy but also resistant to wear and rust. However, using a cast iron pie dish necessitates some considerations, such as seasoning and their somewhat hefty weight.

### To Dishwash or Not to Dishwash: That is the Question

When it comes to dish washing, not all materials are created equal. Some ceramic and cast iron pie dishes may be prone to chipping or discoloration, so it's always crucial to check the manufacturer guidelines before proceeding. Opting for a hand wash, particularly to prolong the lifespan of your pie dish, can be an excellent choice.


### Why Pie Dish Lids Matter

A pie dish lid, or pie crust protector, is a critical accessory in the baking world. This aluminum or silicone lid acts as a shield for your crust, preventing the crust from becoming too dark while it bakes. By using a pie dish lid, you can maintain a perfectly golden-brown and crispy crust, ensuring that your final creation is truly divine.


### Nailing Storage: Keep Your Pie Dishes Spick-and-Span

The key to preserving the life and look of your pie dishes lies in the proper storage. For ceramic or cast iron dishes, they should be kept in a dry and cool place, far from direct sunlight and extreme temperature changes, to prevent warping, cracking, or discoloration.


### Storing Your Aluminum or Stainless Steel Pie Dish: Tips & Tricks

For those with aluminum or stainless steel dishes, you can place them in a cupboard or pantry. To prevent scratches, ensure that you stack them carefully with soft cloths or wrapping in between. It is also important to note that you should avoid storing your dishes with utensils or heavy objects on top.
