### [Paqui One Chip Challenge: 2020 Release with Scorpion and Sichuan Peppercorn](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Peju?utm\_term=paqui-one-chip-challenge-2020-release-with-scorpion-and-sichuan-peppercorn)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Peju?utm_term=paqui-one-chip-challenge-2020-release-with-scorpion-and-sichuan-peppercorn"><img alt="paqui-one-chip-challenge-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/paqui-one-chip-challenge-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

A few days ago, I attempted the one chip challenge, Paqui's newest and hottest chip. The packaging was a bit worn, but I couldn't care less, as long as the product itself was up to the task. As I opened the chip bag, I noticed a pungent aroma filling the air, which had me eager for the imminent spiciness. 

Taking a cautious bite, I was immediately floored by the heat. Paqui spared no expense when it comes to spice, using a blend of scorpion pepper, sichuan peppercorn, and the notorious Carolina reaper. I've tried other incredibly spicy foods before, but this chip was in a league of its own, leaving my taste buds begging for mercy. 

While some enjoy the brutal heat, others appreciate the challenge of completing the task without discomfort. The chip, being the only one in the pack, makes the challenge that much more daunting, as it requires a tremendous amount of courage (or masochism, depending on your perspective) to tackle the spiciness head-on. 

However, while the chip's spiciness is undoubtedly noteworthy, the flavor itself was somewhat disappointing. The promise of a complex, spicy blend failed to materialize in my experience, and I found myself craving something more than just heat. 

In conclusion, the Paqui one chip challenge is a formidable foe for those brave enough to take it on. The heat is intense, but the lack of flavor made it a bit of a letdown. If you're up for the challenge or simply looking for the world's hottest chip, this could be worth a try, but be prepared to suffer the consequences.
