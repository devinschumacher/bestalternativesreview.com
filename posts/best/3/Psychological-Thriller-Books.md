### [Suspenseful Psychological Thriller: Behind Her Eyes](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Psychological+Thriller+Books?utm\_term=suspenseful-psychological-thriller-behind-her-eyes)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Psychological+Thriller+Books?utm_term=suspenseful-psychological-thriller-behind-her-eyes"><img alt="behind-her-eyes-a-suspenseful-psychological-thriller-book-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/behind-her-eyes-a-suspenseful-psychological-thriller-book-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently picked up "Behind Her Eyes" by Sarah Pinborough, a psychological thriller that quickly became an obsessive read. As a suspense-hungry reader, I found this novel to be both gripping and unique in its storytelling. 

First, let's talk about the book's structure: it's told from multiple perspectives - Louise, David, and Adele. This approach keeps the reader on their toes, constantly wondering which character is truly telling the truth. It's like being given a glimpse into the lives of these people, getting lost in their secrets and lies. 

One thing that stood out for me was the intricate web of relationships these characters share. David and Adele seem like the perfect couple until you dive deeper into their marriage. And then there's Louise, the woman who finds herself caught in the middle. The way Pinborough crafts these complex relationships is nothing short of ingenious. 

But there are times when the narrative becomes slightly confusing due to the constant switching between perspectives. It took me a while to remember who was narrating what and when. However, this didn't detract much from my overall enjoyment of the story. 

The biggest surprise, or rather shock, comes at the end. I won't spoil it for potential readers, but suffice it to say, it's a twist that will leave you reeling. It's one of those endings that make you question everything you thought you knew about the story. 

"Behind Her Eyes" is not without its flaws. The characters can sometimes feel one-dimensional, especially Adele, who largely exists to serve as a tool for the plot. And the pacing, while fast-paced for the most part, slows down significantly at times, making certain sections feel dull in comparison to the rest of the book. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, "Behind Her Eyes" is a thrilling read that keeps you guessing till the very end. It's a book that will leave you questioning everything, and that's the sign of a good psychological thriller.
