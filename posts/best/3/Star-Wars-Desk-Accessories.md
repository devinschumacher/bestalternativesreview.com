### [Star Wars Trilogy Glowing Drawing Desk](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Star+Wars+Desk+Accessories?utm\_term=star-wars-trilogy-glowing-drawing-desk)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Star+Wars+Desk+Accessories?utm_term=star-wars-trilogy-glowing-drawing-desk"><img alt="star-wars-trilogy-light-up-drawing-desk-rose-art-1672" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/star-wars-trilogy-light-up-drawing-desk-rose-art-1672/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Star Wars Yoda Paper Clip Holder](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Star+Wars+Desk+Accessories?utm\_term=star-wars-yoda-paper-clip-holder)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Star+Wars+Desk+Accessories?utm_term=star-wars-yoda-paper-clip-holder"><img alt="star-wars-yoda-paper-clip-holder-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/star-wars-yoda-paper-clip-holder-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Imagine strolling into the office one day, only to find an intergalactic warrior patiently awaiting you on your desk. No, it's not a Star Wars movie set, but rather a Paper Clip Holder in the shape of Yoda. Yes, you read that right - a paper clip holder shaped like the wisest Jedi Master of all time. 

The first thing that strikes you about this paper clip holder is its impeccable design. The likeness of Yoda is remarkably authentic, right down to the tiny details like his robes and the characteristic way he leans his head. However, the novelty factor doesn't end there. Instead of just being a quirky paperweight, this holder actually functions as it should. It comfortably holds about 36 paper clips within its grasp. 

One minor annoyance, though, is that the base of the holder lacks magnetic properties like some other similar products. This means you have to find a creative way to secure the clips, like hooking them over Yoda's hand or just placing them inside the well. Nevertheless, with a size of approximately 8.9cm wide, 12.7cm high, and 14cm deep, it takes up a small enough space to not be intrusive on your desk. 

In conclusion, this Star Wars Paper Clip Holder isn't just a functional item but also a piece of art that could liven up any office or workspace. Its quirky design, coupled with excellent craftsmanship, makes it a delight to have around.

As a Star Wars fan, I couldn't resist trying the Obi-Wan Kenobi Edition Desk Mat from Orbitkey.

One of my favorite features is the document hideaway, which provides a neat and organized spot to stow away loose papers and notes. The magnet in the cable holder does an excellent job of keeping your cables in place, making your workspace look more professional. However, I did notice that the backing of the mat, made from the beige felt-like material, tended to slide around easily on hard surfaces, which was a bit frustrating. 

Overall, this desk mat would be a great addition to any workspace, and the added Star Wars touch makes it even more exciting. While there are a few minor issues, the pros far outweigh the cons. So grab your lightsaber, prepare for your Jedi training, and organize your desk with this fantastic desk mat from Orbitkey.
