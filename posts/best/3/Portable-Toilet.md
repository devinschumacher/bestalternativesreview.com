When I went camping with my family last summer, I realized we needed a quick solution for when nature called, especially when we were in the middle of nowhere. That's when I discovered the Reliance Portable Toilet. This 6-gallon gem is a real lifesaver in the wilderness. 

Firstly, the large and deep toilet bowl added a level of comfort that I didn't expect from a portable toilet. The standard 17-inch seat height and 325-pound weight capacity made it a great choice for everyone in our family. But what really stood out was the T-slot flush nozzle, which ensured efficient draining of waste, providing a cleaner experience.

The new smooth uni-style ceramic bowl and plastic base design not only looks great, but also makes cleaning a breeze. Plus, the hand sprayer is a nice touch when it comes to cleaning the toilet. The soft close top and seat are a great addition, especially for late-night bathroom trips with my little ones. 

However, there are a couple of drawbacks. The toilet doesn't come with a hand sprayer, which I missed from my old one. And, unfortunately, some users have experienced issues with the ball valve breaking once the warranty ends. 

Overall, I'm very happy with my decision to upgrade to the Dometic 310 Series Standard toilet. It's well-made, easy to install, and provides a more comfortable and reliable experience compared to my old RV toilet.

However, there were a couple of minor drawbacks. The luggable loo seemed a bit low to the ground, which might not be comfortable for everyone. Additionally, the seat cover could have been a bit more secure, as it sometimes slipped off the lid. 

Overall, the Reliance Luggable Loo Portable Toilet proved to be a reliable and convenient option for my camping needs. While there were a few minor issues, the pros definitely outweighed the cons. It's a great choice for those who want a portable, economical, and easy-to-use toilet for camping, fishing, or emergency situations.

I recently stumbled upon the Trelino Origin M Composting Toilet and decided to give it a try on a weekend getaway. At first, I was a bit skeptical about the composting part, but as I started using it, I realized it was a game-changer for eco-friendly waste management.

Its lightweight build made it perfect for my adventure, and I appreciated the flexibility it offered for disposal.

However, the lack of handles made it slightly difficult to move, and the opening for the urine container was narrow. But those were minor inconveniences compared to the benefits.
