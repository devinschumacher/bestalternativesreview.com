### [ArtBin Paint Storage Tray for 120ml Bottles - Black](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Paint+Tray?utm\_term=artbin-paint-storage-tray-for-120ml-bottles-black)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Paint+Tray?utm_term=artbin-paint-storage-tray-for-120ml-bottles-black"><img alt="artbin-paint-storage-tray-white-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/artbin-paint-storage-tray-white-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the opportunity to try out the ArtBin Paint Storage Tray, and I must say, it's turned out to be quite the handy addition to my art supply storage. Designed to hold 120ml paint bottles and paint tubes, the trays fit seamlessly into my workstation, creating an organized and tidy space for all my craft supplies. 

One of the key features that stood out to me was the trays' ability to stack well together, taking up minimal space. I also appreciate how they can be wall-mounted, providing an even neater solution when floor space is at a premium. It's a thoughtful touch that I'm grateful for as I navigate limited storage options. 

The trays are perfect for storing my 2oz craft paint bottles, and I particularly love how the individual compartments allow me to see each and every color at a glance. This ensures that I never run out of the exact shade I'm looking for, saving me time and effort in the long run. 

However, there are a couple of minor drawbacks I've noticed. Firstly, the trays do have a slight chemical smell when you first open them, which took a few days to dissipate completely. While it's not overwhelming, it's worth mentioning. Secondly, I've found that the paint tray doesn't fit in the Super Satchel 6990AB or 6925AB as the product description suggests. 

Overall, the ArtBin Paint Storage Tray has proven to be a valuable addition to my art supply storage. Its stackable and wall-mountable design, coupled with the individual compartments that allow me to see every color at a glance, make it a worthwhile investment. Despite the minor chemical smell and compatibility issues with the Super Satchel, the pros far outweigh the cons in my experience.

Plus, the non-slip bottom ensures it stays put while you're painting, which is a lifesaver when working with wet paint.

### [Merit Pro 998 Large Volume Paint Tray](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Paint+Tray?utm\_term=merit-pro-998-large-volume-paint-tray)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Paint+Tray?utm_term=merit-pro-998-large-volume-paint-tray"><img alt="merit-pro-998-4-qt-professional-metal-large-volume-paint-tray-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/merit-pro-998-4-qt-professional-metal-large-volume-paint-tray-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The tray is sized to fit 9-1/2 inch roller covers, and its large volume makes it perfect for painting in 3D spaces or for painting walls on both sides at once. 

One of the features that stood out the most during my experience was how easy it was to maneuver while keeping the paint on the walls, instead of the floor. The large roller cover held ample paint, which is great since I could cut down on the number of times I needed to go back for more paint. The tray's depth also ensured the paint didn't splash onto the walls, reducing the overall mess. 

However, the tray did not fit as snugly on my ladder as I would have preferred, causing extra caution during use. This is something that could be improved in the design. The fact that the tray is a bit more expensive compared to its plastic counterparts is also not ideal. 

On the whole, I would recommend the Merit Pro 998 paint tray for anyone involved in large-scale painting jobs, seeking a more professional and efficient experience. It’s the right tool for the job, with pros and cons like any product, but given the performance, I believe it’s worth the investment.

Plus, the fact that it's made from 100% recycled material is a great bonus for those who are environmentally conscious.

## Buyer's Guide

Painting can be a messy and time-consuming task, especially when working with small models or miniatures. A paint tray can make this process more efficient and enjoyable. In this buyer's guide, we will discuss the key features to consider when choosing a paint tray and provide some general advice to help you make the best purchase. 


### Material

Paint trays can be made from various materials, such as plastic, silicone, or metal. The material you choose will impact the durability, ease of cleaning, and overall user experience. Plastic trays are relatively inexpensive and lightweight, but they can be prone to cracking over time. Silicone trays are flexible and resistant to wear, making them a popular choice among hobbyists. Metal trays may be more heavy-duty, but they can be more challenging to clean due to their surface texture.

### Size

The size of the paint tray is an essential factor to consider, as it will determine how much paint you can store at once. If you plan on working on multiple models simultaneously, a larger tray may be preferable. However, if you need to transport your paint tray, a smaller size may be more convenient. Pay attention to the dimensions and volume of the tray to ensure it meets your needs. 


### Dividers

Dividers help to separate paint colors and prevent them from mixing together. Some paint trays come with built-in dividers, while others may require you to purchase them separately. Consider the number and size of compartments needed for your specific project and whether the tray you're considering has the appropriate dividers.

### Design

The design of a paint tray can significantly impact its functionality and convenience. Look for features such as grooves or channels to collect excess paint, non-slip bases to prevent the tray from moving during use, and handles or lids to make transportation and storage easier. Some trays also feature built-in wells for storing paintbrushes, which can be a handy addition.

### What is a paint tray?

A paint tray is a flat, shallow container designed to hold paint while working on a project. It allows for easier paint application and reduces the risk of spills and messes. Paint trays are typically made of plastic or metal materials and come in various sizes to suit different painting needs. They are commonly used in various DIY projects, like painting furniture or walls, and are a must-have tool for any painter. 

Some key features of a paint tray to look for include sturdy construction, an easy-to-clean surface, and a design that allows for easy pouring or dipping of paint. Proper storage is also important to maintain the integrity of the tray and prevent damage from impacts or moisture exposure. A good-quality paint tray can significantly improve the overall painting experience and help you achieve a smooth, professional finish. 


### What materials are paint trays made of?

Paint trays are usually made of plastic or metal materials. Plastic trays are lightweight, affordable, and easy to use, making them a popular choice for DIY enthusiasts. They come in various sizes and colors, and their easy-to-clean surface is great for reducing messes. Metal trays, on the other hand, offer better durability and heat resistance, making them suitable for professional painters dealing with high-temperature paints or heavy-duty projects. 

When choosing a paint tray, consider the materials' advantages and disadvantages. Plastic trays are generally more affordable and easier to maintain, while metal trays provide better resistance and versatility. Ultimately, the best material for a paint tray depends on the frequency of use, the type of paint, and the user's preferences.

### What size paint tray should I choose?

The size of the paint tray you need depends on the scope of your project. For smaller projects, such as painting furniture or a wall, a standard-sized paint tray (usually around 12 inches by 18 inches) will work well. For larger projects, like painting a room or a wall with multiple colors, a larger paint tray (up to 24 inches by 36 inches) will be more convenient and allow for more efficient paint application. 

If you're unsure about the size to choose, consider the paint coverage and the number of paint colors you'll be using. A larger tray will allow you to keep all the colors organized and reduce the risk of confusion or contamination during the painting process. Additionally, having a larger paint tray will make it easier to refill or clean if needed. 


### Are paint trays dishwasher-safe?

Most paint trays are dishwasher-safe, making them easily cleanable and a popular choice for DIY projects. However, it is crucial to follow the manufacturer's instructions to ensure the tray maintains its durability and functionality. While dishwasher-safe, some plastic or metal trays may be damaged or lose their color if placed in direct contact with cleaning agents or high temperatures. 

If you're unsure about your paint tray's dishwasher-safety, consider handwashing it using warm, soapy water. This method allows you to thoroughly clean the tray without the risk of damage, and it is also a gentler option for metal trays with intricate designs or decorative finishes. Be sure to dry the tray properly before storing it to prevent any residual moisture from causing damage.

### How do I store my paint tray when it's not in use?

Storing your paint tray in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture is essential to maintain its quality and prevent damage. Ideal storage locations include garages, sheds, or workshops with stable temperatures and humidity levels. Ensure that the tray is placed on a flat surface, such as a shelf or a table, to prevent any potential damage from falling or bending. 

Additionally, be sure to clean the paint tray thoroughly before storing it to remove any dried paint, dirt, or debris that may have accumulated during use. This step not only prolongs the tray's lifespan but also ensures a more straightforward cleaning process the next time it is used. Storing your paint tray properly will help you save time and money in the long run by preventing the need for frequent replacements. 


### Can I paint directly on the paint tray?

While it is possible to paint directly onto the paint tray surface, it is generally not recommended. Painting directly on the tray can result in uneven coverage, increased drying time, and difficulty in achieving clean edges or straight lines. Instead, it is advisable to use a high-quality brush or painter's tape to ensure a smooth, professional finish. 

Using paint trays as a surface to hold and transfer paint is a more effective and practical approach. By pouring or dipping paint into the tray, you can achieve better paint coverage and reduce the risk of spills or messes. Additionally, using a paint tray allows you to easily refill or clean the surface if needed, making it more efficient and convenient for your painting needs.
