### [Paxcess Cordless Robotic Pool Vacuum - Effortless Pool Cleaning](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Pool+Cleaners?utm\_term=paxcess-cordless-robotic-pool-vacuum-effortless-pool-cleaning)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Pool+Cleaners?utm_term=paxcess-cordless-robotic-pool-vacuum-effortless-pool-cleaning"><img alt="paxcess-cordless-robotic-pool-cleaner-automatic-pool-vacuum-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/paxcess-cordless-robotic-pool-cleaner-automatic-pool-vacuum-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently gave the Paxcess Cordless Robotic Pool Cleaner a try, and I must say it's been quite the experience. This little cleaning machine has certainly made its mark on my in-ground pool. With its impressive 150 square feet of coverage per hour, I was eager to see how it would fare with the layer of dirt and debris that had built up over time. 

The cleaner's built-in floating handle and rechargeable battery made it easy to maneuver around the pool, and the advanced battery detection technology meant I never had to worry about low power notifications. However, I noticed that the product's durability was not up to par with other pool cleaners I've tried in the past. After about two weeks, the cleaner stopped working altogether, leaving me with a pool that no longer had any dirt or debris on the floor. 

Despite its shortcomings, the Paxcess Cordless Robotic Pool Cleaner managed to pull up some impressive results. Its ability to detect and pick up dirt in areas that would have been nearly impossible with a net was quite impressive. If you have a smaller pool and are looking for a cost-effective option, this cordless robotic pool cleaner may be worth a try. However, if you're dealing with larger pools or areas prone to wind-blown debris, you may want to consider another pressure-side cleaner for optimal performance.

The large filter basket that's easy to clean is also a highlight, as it keeps the filtration process hassle-free. 

What I found impressive is the brush spinning at twice the speed of the robot. It ensures effective scrubbing and cleaning, and it's noticeable when you compare it to competitors. Although the cleaner might be a bit heavy when wet, the water quickly drains. The programmable timer is another feature I appreciate, as it saves energy and ensures my pool gets cleaned at the right time.

### [Dolphin Triton PS: Superior Above Ground Pool Cleaner](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Pool+Cleaners?utm\_term=dolphin-triton-ps-superior-above-ground-pool-cleaner)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Pool+Cleaners?utm_term=dolphin-triton-ps-superior-above-ground-pool-cleaner"><img alt="dolphin-triton-ps-robotic-pool-cleaner-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/dolphin-triton-ps-robotic-pool-cleaner-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Dolphin Robotic Cleaner caught my attention not only for its top-notch reputation but also its innovative design. Sleek and petite, the Triton PS looked like it could whirl around our pool without any obstacle in its way. 

The first thing I noticed was how user-friendly it was. I mean, who wouldn't wanna say goodbye to the traditional suction cleaners that always seemed to leave a little dust behind? The remote control added a cherry on top; it let me customize the cleaning schedule with just the touch of a button. 

Now, let's talk about the fun part - the actual cleaning! The Triton PS is an underwater cleaning machine that effortlessly climbs up walls and scrubs waterline and steps (although it's not perfect, just a foot or so off on the latter). Not only did it pick up even the tiniest of debris, but it also managed to clean our in-ground pool in a mere two hours. 

Honestly, the best part was knowing that the power source was energy-efficient, and it extended our pool filtration system's life. The filtration system might have been a little noisy at first, but it wasn't so loud that it disrupted our pool time. 

Despite all the positives, there's one downside I'd like to address - the cord. It's a design flaw that left me quite unsatisfied. A year into it, the cord started to wear, causing blue grit to fall into our pool; not exactly pool cleaner-like. 

Overall, the Dolphin Triton PS Robotic Pool Cleaner is a game-changer in pool maintenance, provided the cord issue doesn't become a major problem. With its nimble, deep cleaning tactics, the Triton PS is a welcome addition that will undoubtedly be getting its fair share of pool parties.

One of the standout features is the ease of adjusting suction power - a big thumbs up for customization! Not only does it save you time, but it also helps tailor the cleaning experience to your preferences. 

However, this Pool Vacuum Cleaner isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. It struggles with leaves and can make some noise while operating. But hey, for the price it comes at, I'm happy to overlook the occasional leaf and the lack of a silent sweep. 

The weight block included with the Vacuum Cleaner is a fantastic addition as it allows me to adjust the buoyancy according to my pool's depth, ensuring it stays in place and does its job effectively. 

And let me tell you, this cleaning machine is a steal! The cost-effectiveness is hard to pass up, and considering the impressive features it offers and the results it delivers, I highly recommend it.

The frequency of pool cleaning will depend on various factors such as the size of the pool, the level of use, and the type of debris in the pool. As a general rule, pools should be cleaned regularly during the swimming season to maintain their cleanliness and to prevent buildup of debris. This may be once or twice a week for most pools. 

It's essential to be proactive in maintaining your pool by regularly inspecting its water quality, checking and maintaining chemical levels, and removing debris and dirt buildup. Doing so will ensure a clean and safe swimming environment for you and your family, and help extend the life of the pool. 


### What features should I look for when buying a pool cleaner?

When purchasing a pool cleaner, consider its size, durability, and power source. For larger pools, a more powerful cleaner may be necessary to achieve thorough cleaning. Additionally, look for features such as variable suction power, adjustable nozzle, and a bag or cartridge filtration system that makes cleaning easier and more efficient. 

It's also important to consider the ease of operation and maintenance of the pool cleaner, as well as its ability to handle debris and dirt efficiently. Finally, consider your budget and the cost of replacement parts and filters over time. By evaluating these factors, you can choose the best pool cleaner for your pool and ensure it meets your needs and preferences. 


### Can I use a pool cleaner in a saltwater pool?

Yes, you can use a pool cleaner in a saltwater pool, but it's essential to choose one designed for saltwater pools, as they are specifically designed to handle the unique properties of saltwater. Additionally, saltwater pools may require more frequent cleaning due to the dissolution of salt, which can create a buildup of residue and algae. As a result, it's essential to choose a pool cleaner that can handle this increased demand and provide effective cleaning. 

When cleaning a saltwater pool, it's also important to avoid using harsh or abrasive chemicals, as they can damage the pool's surfaces and equipment. Instead, rely on natural cleaning methods and regular maintenance to keep your saltwater pool clean and healthy. By doing so, you can ensure a clean and safe swimming environment for you and your family, and extend the life of your pool. 


### What is the cost of operating a pool cleaner?

The cost of operating a pool cleaner will vary based on the type of cleaner and the frequency of use. Generally, manual and automatic pool cleaners are the most affordable options, while robotic cleaners can be more expensive. However, robotic cleaners offer a balance between affordability and efficiency, making them a popular choice for many pool owners. 

In addition to the upfront cost of the cleaner, pool owners should also consider the cost of replacement parts and filters over time. These expenses can vary depending on the frequency of use and the lifespan of the cleaner's components. By choosing a pool cleaner that is reliable and easy to maintain, pool owners can keep operating costs to a minimum and maximize the long-term benefits of owning a pool cleaner.
