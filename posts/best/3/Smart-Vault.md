### [Liberty Safe HDX-250 Smart Vault with Biometric Security](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Smart+Vault?utm\_term=liberty-safe-hdx-250-smart-vault-with-biometric-security)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Smart+Vault?utm_term=liberty-safe-hdx-250-smart-vault-with-biometric-security"><img alt="liberty-safe-hdx-250-biometric-smart-vault-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/liberty-safe-hdx-250-biometric-smart-vault-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently bought the Liberty HDX-250 Biometric Smart Vault, and let me tell you, it has been a game-changer in my home! The biometric finger swipe technology works like a charm, allowing me to access my vault in just a few seconds. I appreciate how the safe can store 15 different fingerprints so that my wife and I can have separate access to our firearms. 

One thing that stood out to me is the heavy-duty steel construction. It's not only sturdy but also tamper resistant, offering me the peace of mind I need when storing my firearms. The lighted interior is a nice touch, especially when finding something in the safe in low light conditions. 

However, I've encountered a couple of issues as well. Firstly, the interior light isn't as bright as I'd like, and I find myself reaching for my phone light when I need to grab something from the safe. 

Secondly, I was disappointed to learn that the mounting hardware wasn't included with the safe. I believe it should be standard to have the necessary hardware for safe installation. 

Overall, I'm pleased with the Liberty HDX-250 Biometric Smart Vault and would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a secure and quick way to access their firearms at home. Just remember to take note of the minor gripes I mentioned earlier, and you'll be good to go!

I recently had the opportunity to try out the Vaultek RS500i WiFi Biometric Smart Rifle Safe. This safe is not only sleek and stylish, but also incredibly useful for securing my firearms. 

One of the highlights of using the RS500i is its smooth, spring-loaded AR mount. This feature makes it incredibly easy to store and access my guns, with minimal effort required. Another beneficial feature is the included pistol holster and AR [magazine rack](https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativesreview.com/blob/main/posts/best/2/Magazine-Rack.md). They provide convenient storage options for various guns and magazines. 

However, the safety features could be improved, especially for those who prioritize security. The fingerprint scanner sometimes struggled to recognize my fingers, which made accessing the safe less efficient. Nonetheless, the overall build quality of the RS500i is solid, and I appreciated the anti-pry design to prevent unauthorized access. 

In summary, the Vaultek RS500i WiFi Biometric Smart Rifle Safe is a great option for those seeking a stylish and convenient storage solution for their firearms. While the security measures may not be perfect, the ease of use and smart features make it a worthwhile investment for protecting your valuable possessions.
