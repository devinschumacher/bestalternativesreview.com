### [Chuck Taylor All Star High Top Platform Clean Leather White Women's Size 10.5](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/White+Converse+High+Tops+Platform?utm\_term=chuck-taylor-all-star-high-top-platform-clean-leather-white-womens-size-10-5)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/White+Converse+High+Tops+Platform?utm_term=chuck-taylor-all-star-high-top-platform-clean-leather-white-womens-size-10-5"><img alt="chuck-taylor-all-star-platform-clean-leather-high-top-white-size-womens-10-5-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/chuck-taylor-all-star-platform-clean-leather-high-top-white-size-womens-10-5-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a woman who loves fashion, I found myself attracted to these Chuck Taylor All Star Platform Clean Leather High Tops in White Size 10.5 for a variety of reasons. First and foremost, their high-top design gave me a sense of confidence and protection, ensuring that my ankles were well-supported during any physical activities. The cushioned footbed provided by the EVA insole was a fantastic surprise, providing me with amazing comfort and support while I walked around. In fact, these shoes were so comfortable that I felt like I could wear them all day long without any discomfort at all. 

However, there were a few aspects of these sneakers that I wasn't too fond of. For instance, the canvas material, while lovely to look at, was prone to staining easily. This meant that I needed to be extra careful when wearing them out, since any accidental spills could ruin the beautiful white color. Another minor issue that I encountered was with the laces – they seemed to fray quite easily, which was a bit frustrating. 

Despite the few cons, I overall enjoyed wearing these Chuck Taylor All Star Platform Clean Leather High Tops. They were stylish, comfortable, and offered the right blend of protection and support that I needed. I highly recommend them to anyone who is looking for a versatile pair of sneakers that can be worn both casually and for more active endeavors.

Recently, I tried out the Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Lift High Top Platform Sneaker in Egret/Phantom Violet/Egret. At first, I was a bit skeptical about the suede upper, but once I put them on, I was pleasantly surprised by their comfort and style. The contrast piping adds a utility-inspired touch, and the subtle earthy tones make it perfect for autumn. 

One of the best features of these sneakers is the OrthoLite cushioning, which keeps my feet comfy even after a long day of walking. The tonal design also makes it easy to match with any outfit, and the iconic Chuck Taylor ankle patch is a nice touch. The high-top design provides extra support and a trendy look. 

However, I did find that the sizing was a bit off for me; I usually wear an 8.5, but these sneakers felt a bit snug. I would recommend sizing down for the best fit. Additionally, some users have mentioned that the shoes run larger, so it's worth considering that as well. 

Overall, I'm happy with my purchase of the Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Lift High Top Platform Sneaker. The style, comfort, and quality are all excellent, and they've quickly become a staple in my wardrobe. With their affordable price and versatile design, I would definitely recommend these sneakers to anyone looking for a comfortable and stylish addition to their footwear collection.

### [Elevated Platform Canvas Sneakers for Women - White Converse High Top](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/White+Converse+High+Tops+Platform?utm\_term=elevated-platform-canvas-sneakers-for-women-white-converse-high-top)

I recently tried out the Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Lift High Top Platform Sneakers in black/white/white at Nordstrom, size 6. I was really excited to try this iconic shoe, known for its comfortable and stylish design. To my delight, the sneakers were indeed both comfortable and stylish, thanks to the round toe shape that gave ample room for my forefoot. The authentic logo at the heel added a touch of classic charm to the shoes. 

One of the standout features of the Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars was its canvas material. The canvas was both refined and edgy, depending on how I styled it, and the double-stacked sole took me higher than I expected. The platform provided a nice lift, making me feel a bit more confident in my step. The lace-up closure allowed for a snug yet adjustable fit, and the star ankle patch added a fun pop of style. 

While I enjoyed wearing these sneakers, there were a couple of drawbacks. One, the canvas material might not be the most durable, as I noticed a few fraying areas after just a few months of wear. Two, the platform's height may not be ideal for everyone, and those less comfortable with higher shoes might need to adjust their stride. 

Overall, my experience with the Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Lift High Top Platform Sneakers in black/white/white was a mix of enjoyment and disappointment. While I was pleased with the style and comfort aspects of the shoe, the durability and height might not be suitable for everyone.

### [Converse White High Tops Platform - Women's Size 7 'Autumn Embroidery'](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/White+Converse+High+Tops+Platform?utm\_term=converse-white-high-tops-platform-womens-size-7-autumn-embroidery)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/White+Converse+High+Tops+Platform?utm_term=converse-white-high-tops-platform-womens-size-7-autumn-embroidery"><img alt="converse-wmns-chuck-taylor-all-star-lift-platform-high-autumn-embroidery-white-womens-size-7-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/converse-wmns-chuck-taylor-all-star-lift-platform-high-autumn-embroidery-white-womens-size-7-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased a pair of these charming Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Lift Platform sneakers in the size 7, and I must say, I am absolutely in love with them! The texture-rich fabric at the upper with the signature logo patch and sparse touches of floral embroidery adds a splash of charm and character to the classic design. The mid-height platform provides a subtle boost, making me feel as if I'm walking on air. The lace-up closure ensures a comfortable and secure fit. 

One of the highlights of this product has got to be the platform height. At 1.5 inches or 40mm, it provides the perfect amount of lift without feeling too much like wearing platform shoes. The removable insole is a great touch, offering extra comfort for those who require it. Another standout feature is the contrast embroidery on the signature logo patch, which adds a unique and modern twist on the classic Converse aesthetic. 

However, there are a couple of cons that I've noticed during my time with these shoes. The first is the lack of waterproofing. As a frequent runner, this can be a bit problematic, but I've found that using a waterproofing spray does help to combat this issue. Another minor inconvenience is the somewhat tight fit around the ankle, but this can be rectified by going up half a size when ordering. 

All in all, these adorable and comfortable sneakers have quickly made their way into my daily wardrobe, and I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a stylish and practical upgrade to their Converse collection.

In the last few months, I've been rocking the Converse Run Star Hike Hi sneakers, and they've been quite the ride. I remember when I was younger, I used to wear regular Converse but found them to be quite uncomfortable, leading me to abandon that brand. However, these high-tops changed all that. 

The first thing that stood out to me was the unique design. The two-tone outsole and rounded heel added a modern touch to the traditional high-top silhouette, making them a stylish choice. I've worn them to casual gatherings and even to a formal event, and they effortlessly elevated the look. 

Another feature that impressed me was the comfort level. The shoe's maximum comfort design allowed me to walk miles without feeling any fatigue. The cushioning and support were outstanding, ensuring that I could enjoy every step. 

One minor downside I encountered was the lack of a lace tab to hold the laces in place on the tongue. This made the laces slide out frequently during the first few weeks of use, but once I sewed in a loop, the problem was solved. 

Overall, these Converse sneakers left me genuinely satisfied with their comfort, style, durability, and traction. The fit was perfect, and the versatility made them my go-to choice for both casual and formal events. I highly recommend the Converse Run Star Hike Hi sneakers to anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable pair of high-tops.
