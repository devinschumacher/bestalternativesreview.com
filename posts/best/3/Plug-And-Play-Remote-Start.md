### [Ford Plug & Play Remote Start System for 2013+ Vehicles](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Plug+And+Play+Remote+Start?utm\_term=ford-plug-play-remote-start-system-for-2013-vehicles)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Plug+And+Play+Remote+Start?utm_term=ford-plug-play-remote-start-system-for-2013-vehicles"><img alt="fortin-remote-start-module-t-harness-combo-for-select-2013-ford-vehicles-evo-fort3-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fortin-remote-start-module-t-harness-combo-for-select-2013-ford-vehicles-evo-fort3-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a car owner living in a cold climate, I can attest to the value of having a remote start module for my Ford vehicle. The Fortin EVO-FORT3 fits my 2013+ Ford perfectly and is an all-in-one package - an alarm, data bypass, and remote start module all rolled into one. Its included THAR-FOR3 T-harness made installation quick and easy, and the CrimeStopper compatibility was an added bonus for peace of mind. 

However, I must admit that the 3x start feature had its quirks. Sometimes, the delay between hitting the button combination and the truck starting felt inconsistent, fluctuating from 5 seconds to 15 seconds. This wasn't entirely related to the distance or line of sight, but rather the state of the truck itself. For example, if I left the heater on, it wouldn't work. This was somewhat disappointing because I was left in the cold truck before, trying to warm up. 

That said, the price of the Fortin EVO-FORT3 is a fraction of what I would have paid for a Ford dealership to install a similar system. Furthermore, no extra key fob or antenna is required. In fact, the lack of honking when the truck starts was a significant plus for anyone looking for discretion. 

Overall, if you consider yourself an early riser and someone who likes to hop into a warm vehicle before your coffee, the Fortin EVO-FORT3 remote start module is a great choice to have in your garage. Just remember to account for the variability in the delay time when using the 3x start option.

I've recently started using the Start-X Remote Starter for my 2009 Silverado, and let me tell you, it has been a game changer for those chilly mornings. The "plug n pay" feature really lives up to its name, making installation a breeze with just a few minor disassemblies to my vehicle. 

One of the best parts about this remote starter is its compatibility with my Silverado's automatic transmission. It's nice to not have to worry about any potential issues with the vehicle's overall mechanics. The T-Harness also eliminates the need for any wire cutting or splicing, making the installation process even smoother. 

The instructions provided are clear and easy to follow, and the installation video available online is a helpful tool for those who may need a little extra guidance. I've found myself appreciating the remote starter's convenience and the ability to defog my windshield before even stepping outside. 

However, there is a catch: this remote starter is only compatible with specific years of Silverado and Sierra, making it a bit limiting for those looking for a versatile option. While this particular remote starter has served me well, I do wish it was compatible with a wider range of vehicles. 

Overall, the Start-X Remote Starter has been a fantastic addition to my daily routine, but I'll just have to keep an eye out for other options if I were to ever switch to another vehicle.

The HCX control module, with its built-in bypass module, ensures a smooth integration of the system into your car. 

However, there were a few downsides to my experience. Firstly, the product can be quite pricey, including the cost of additional parts and labor for professional installation.

One of the critical features of this remote that stood out to me is the 'Virtual Tach' which eliminates the need for a tach wire in most installations. Now, I know this might sound simple, but it's a lifesaver when it comes to installation - no more messing around with wires, and the installation process is much smoother. 

The remote comes with two 4-button remotes, each with auxiliary outputs for added convenience. The range of the remote is impressive, and I was able to start my car from quite a distance without any issues. 

However, there were a couple of drawbacks to this product. Firstly, it could be a bit more durable - I've seen remotes made from sturdier materials that can withstand a few drops or bumps. But this is a personal preference and may not be a deal-breaker for everyone. 

Secondly, the instruction guide could have been clearer and more user-friendly. If you're not experienced with installing remote start systems, the instructions may leave you feeling a bit lost. But once you've wrapped your head around it, the installation becomes relatively straightforward. 

Overall, I'm happy with my purchase of the Avital 4105L remote start system. With its easy-to-use interface, impressive range, and versatile features, it's definitely a great choice for anyone looking for a reliable and efficient remote start system. Just remember to be patient during installation, and don't be afraid to seek help if you're not confident enough to do it yourself.

The kit also comes with bypass module for installation, which was a breeze. However, I did have one minor issue - the trunk unlock feature, the wiring of which didn't seem to function as intended. It's a shame that, despite easy installation and understanding, I needed to depend on my own troubleshooting skills because of a lack of product support. 

Overall, the Compustar CS920-S is a great product if you're capable of figuring things out on your own. It has its quirks but offers a high level of security and a sense of luxury one usually associates with flashy car models.
