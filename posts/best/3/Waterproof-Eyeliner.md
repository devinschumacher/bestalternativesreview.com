### [NYX Retractable Waterproof Eyeliner - Black MPE02](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Eyeliner?utm\_term=nyx-retractable-waterproof-eyeliner-black-mpe02)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Eyeliner?utm_term=nyx-retractable-waterproof-eyeliner-black-mpe02"><img alt="nyx-eye-liner-retractable-water-proof-black-mpe02-0-01-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/nyx-eye-liner-retractable-water-proof-black-mpe02-0-01-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer, I've been using the NYX Retractable Eyeliner on a daily basis and have to say, it's been an absolute game-changer for my makeup routine. The eyeliner glides on smoothly, offering a precise application that's effortless to achieve. The color payoff is outstanding in this product, giving me the ability to create bold and beautiful winged eyeliner looks or more natural, subtle lines. 

One of my favorite features of this eyeliner is its smudge-proof and waterproof properties. I've tested this product through the toughest scenarios - hot summer days and even teary-eyed moments - and it's remained intact, looking as vibrant and bold as when I first applied it. The formula never feels drying to my skin, which I appreciate, especially since I have more sensitive eyelids. 

However, I will mention a minor downside. The pencil has a tendency to dry out quickly if left open for too long. It's crucial to close the cap after usage to prevent this from happening. Other than that, I haven't encountered any other issues with the product. Overall, the NYX Retractable Eyeliner is a high-quality, affordable, and effective product that I can't get enough of!

The rich, black hue was indeed very pigmented and provided a bold look that lasted all day long. No smudge or smear could shake this eyeliner, making it a true game-changer in my makeup routine. 

However, I did encounter a slight downside to this otherwise great product. While the product's softness made it easy to blend, it also led to the eyeliner breaking easily. I found that the eyeliner would crumble off if I applied too much pressure while applying it to achieve a sharp line. 

Additionally, the eyeliner started to come off in tiny specks once it had set, which was quite frustrating. This caused a minor inconvenience when I tried to correct any mistakes or touch-ups, and I had to be very careful in doing so.

## Buyer's Guide

Welcome to our buyer's guide for waterproof eyeliners! In this section, we will be discussing the important features to consider when purchasing a waterproof eyeliner, as well as providing some general advice for getting the most out of your product. Remember, the goal of this guide is to help you make an informed decision when choosing a waterproof eyeliner, without mentioning specific products or external resources. 


### Considerations

1. Water resistance: This is the primary feature you should look for when purchasing a waterproof eyeliner. The higher the water resistance rating, the longer your eyeliner will last in water or sweaty conditions. Look for eyeliners with a rating of at least 12 hours water resistance for the best results. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Eyeliner"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Waterproof-Eyeliner-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Waterproof-Eyeliner-2" height="540"></a></div>


### Application Types

2. Liquid liners: These are typically felt-tip or brush-tip applicators that allow for precise application and control. Liquid liners are great for creating sharp, defined lines, but they may require more practice to master the application technique. Look for a liquid liner with a flexible, smudge-proof formula for the best results. 


### Application Types

3. Pencil liners: Pencil liners are typically easier to apply and require less practice than liquid liners. They come in various shades and formulas, including waterproof and smudge-proof options. Look for a pencil liner with a soft, smudgeless formula for the best results. Pencil liners can also be used to create subtle, natural looks or more dramatic, bold lines. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Eyeliner"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Waterproof-Eyeliner-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Waterproof-Eyeliner-3" height="540"></a></div>


### Application Types

4. Gel liners: Gel liners are a long-lasting option that offers flexible, smudge-proof wear. They can be used with a variety of applicators, including brushes or felt-tip pens. Look for a gel liner with a creamy, blendable formula for the best results. They are ideal for creating natural or glamorous looks that last all day. 


## FAQ

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Eyeliner"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Waterproof-Eyeliner-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Waterproof-Eyeliner-4" height="540"></a></div>


### How does waterproof eyeliner differ from regular eyeliner?

Waterproof eyeliner is designed to stay put even in the presence of water or sweat, making it an ideal choice for those who lead an active lifestyle or have a natural tear flow. Unlike regular eyeliner that may smudge or wash off easily, waterproof eyeliner offers long-lasting wear and keeps its shape throughout the day. 

Waterproof eyeliners typically contain water-resistant ingredients such as wax and silicone, which create a barrier against moisture. They're ideal for special events, outdoor activities, or any time you want your makeup to stay put for a longer period. However, they can sometimes be more difficult to remove at the end of the day. 


### Is there a difference between waterproof liquid and waterproof pencil eyeliner?

Yes, there is a difference between waterproof liquid and waterproof pencil eyeliner. Waterproof liquid eyeliner is a smooth, liquid formula that applies quickly and easily with a thin brush or felt-tip applicator. It dries quickly, allowing for precise, straight lines or winged looks. Once dried, it's highly resistant to water and sweat, offering long-lasting wear. 

On the other hand, waterproof pencil eyeliner is a soft, waxy pencil that glides on easily and offers a more smudgy, natural look. It's particularly useful for creating subtle winged liner or natural-looking daytime looks. However, because it's made from waxy ingredients, it's not as waterproof or long-lasting as liquid counterparts, but it is generally easier to remove at the end of the day. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Waterproof+Eyeliner"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Waterproof-Eyeliner-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Waterproof-Eyeliner-5" height="540"></a></div>


### How do you remove waterproof eyeliner?

Removing waterproof eyeliner can be a bit more challenging than removing regular eyeliner, but it's definitely possible. Start by using a gentle makeup remover that is specifically designed for waterproof makeup. Soak a cotton pad with the remover, press it gently onto your eyeliner without rubbing, and let the product sit for a minute. Then, apply gentle pressure and use the pad to wipe the eyeliner away. If needed, dip a cotton swab in makeup remover and use it to clean up any stubborn lines along your lash line. 

If you prefer a more traditional method, you can also use an oil-based makeup remover or a thin layer of coconut oil to break down the eyeliner before cleansing with a makeup remover. Remember to always be gentle around the eye area and avoid rubbing too hard, as this can cause irritation or damage your delicate skin. 


### Can I use waterproof eyeliner for a smokey eye look?

Absolutely! Waterproof eyeliner is perfect for achieving a bold, smokey eye look, as it stays put even as you blend and layer colors. For a classic smokey eye, start by applying a dark liquid or pencil liner along your upper lash line, then smudge it slightly with a small brush or your finger to create a soft, smudged effect. You can also use a waterproof eyeshadow for a more subtle, gradient smoked-out effect. Just be sure to remove the liner carefully at the end of the day to avoid staining or irritation. 

If you prefer a more dramatic, colorful smokey eye, consider using colorful waterproof eyeliners for a bold, graphic look. Blend the colors together gently and use them to create a gradient effect along the upper lash line or the entire lid. This technique is ideal for a party or a night out when you want your makeup to truly stand out.

### Are there any hypoallergenic waterproof eyeliners?

Yes, there are hypoallergenic waterproof eyeliners available on the market designed for people who have sensitive skin or allergies. Look for products that are labeled 'hypoallergenic' or 'allergy-tested' and are free from common irritants like fragrances, alcohol, and parabens. These products typically contain natural ingredients and are formulated to be gentle on the skin without causing redness, itching, or other allergic reactions. Remember, it's always a good idea to perform a patch test before using any new makeup products to ensure that they're suitable for your skin and won't cause any adverse reactions. 

Additionally, some brands offer certified cruelty-free and vegan waterproof eyeliners for those concerned about animal welfare. These products are usually clearly labeled and can be found in most major beauty retailers or online stores. Look for brands such as Kat Von D, Tarte, or Maybelline, which have a variety of hypoallergenic, cruelty-free, and vegan makeup products to choose from. 


### How do I choose the best waterproof eyeliner for my eye shape?

Choosing the right waterproof eyeliner for your eye shape depends on your personal preferences and the desired effect. If you have a monolid eye shape, a flick of liquid liner or a precise pencil line around your lids can help create the illusion of a crease and add dimension to your eyes. For a cat-eye winged effect, consider using a black or dark brown liquid liner and follow the natural curve of your lash line. For almond-shaped eyes, you can enhance the shape with a winged liner that starts from the outer corner of your eye and extends slightly upward. 

If you have a deep-set eye shape, choose a pencil liner with a slightly shimmery finish to reflect light and make your eyes appear more open and bright. For hooded eyes, opt for a liquid liner that is thicker at the lid and thinner at the outer corner, to help avoid the eyes looking smaller. Use a pencil liner or a thin liquid line for the upper lash line to create the appearance of a full, open-eyed look. Lastly, for round eyes, avoid winged liners that extend too far out, as this can make your eyes look even rounder. Instead, opt for a slightly winged line that starts at the outer edge of your eye, which will give the illusion of a longer, pointed shape.
