Despite this minor inconvenience, I would highly recommend LOMA's Violet Collection Duo to anyone looking to maintain their hair color. It's a small price to pay for the stunning results.

One of the things I loved the most about this shampoo is its rich, pleasant smell. It doesn't overpower your senses, and it's a nice change from typical hair products with harsh scents. 

However, there's one thing I'd like to mention as a slight drawback. While it's great that the shampoo leaves my hair feeling hydrated, it can be quite difficult to rinse out completely.

Overall, the TIGI Catwalk Fashionista Violet Shampoo has made a significant difference in my hair care routine, and I can't help but recommend it to anyone who's struggling with brassy tones and dull-looking highlights. The benefits definitely outweigh the minor drawbacks, and I'll definitely continue to use it in the future.

### [Aluram Violet Color Enhancing Shampoo, 33.8 oz](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Violet+Shampoo?utm\_term=aluram-violet-color-enhancing-shampoo-33-8-oz)

I recently gave the Aluram Purple Shampoo a try in my daily hair care routine, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for me. As someone who has struggled with finding the right shampoo for my highlighted hair, I was pleasantly surprised by the results of this product. 

One of the first things I noticed about the Aluram Purple Shampoo is its vibrant, almost electric purple color. It reminded me of the shades you'd see in a 90's sci-fi movie. But don't let that fool you; this shampoo is not just a pretty color, it's packed with effective ingredients. 

One of the highlights of this product is its ability to maintain and enhance the brightness of my highlights without drying out my hair. I've tried other purple shampoos in the past that have left my hair feeling stripped and frizzy. Not the case with the Aluram Purple Shampoo. It left my hair feeling strong and silky, and the deep conditioning properties ensured it didn't dry out. 

While the product did provide impressive results, there were some notable cons. Firstly, it took a bit of adjustment to figure out the right amount to use. Too much and it turned my hair into a vibrant shade of purple, not my natural blonde. Secondly, the shampoo did leave a slight purple tint on some of my towels, which wasn’t ideal. 

Despite these minor issues, the Aluram Purple Shampoo definitely proved to be a helpful addition to my hair care routine. With a blend of Rose Hip and Biotin to add shine and strength, the shampoo didn't just change my hair color, but it also changed the way I felt about my blonde locks. It's a worthy investment for anyone looking to enhance and maintain their blonde hair. 

In conclusion, the Aluram Purple Shampoo is a versatile, effective product that has helped me achieve the blonde glow I've always desired. While it had some minor shortcomings, I believe the pros outweigh the cons. It's definitely a shampoo worth considering if you're a blonde beauty like me.

I recently tried out The Beachwaver Co. 's BRB Blonde Purple Shampoo, and I was pleasantly surprised! As someone who has bleached and colored hair, it's always a challenge to find the right purple shampoo that actually makes a difference. 

The first thing that caught my attention was the shampoo's consistency. It's thicker than most shampoos I've used, which initially made me hesitant. However, a little goes a long way, and it lathers up nicely. The violet pigment in the shampoo helps to cancel out any brassy tones in my hair, giving it a bright, blonde glow. I love that it's infused with shea butter, which adds moisture and helps to keep my hair from feeling dry or brittle. 

One of the standout features of this shampoo is the HIx Bond Multipliers. These help to strengthen my hair while also improving its tone. I've noticed that my hair feels stronger and more manageable since I started using this product. Plus, the Hydro + Ionic Alpha Bond Multiplier technology strengthens the internal hair structure, providing my hair with extra support and shine. 

The fragrance of the shampoo is also something to note. It's a fresh, fruity blend of sun-kissed Brazilian blackberries, French apricots, and flowering jasmine sambac. It's the perfect balance of tropical and floral notes that leaves my hair smelling lovely. The included conditioner complements the shampoo perfectly, leaving my hair soft and silky without weighing it down. 

Overall, I'm really impressed with The Beachwaver Co. 's BRB Blonde Purple Shampoo. It's a great product for those of us with bleached and colored hair who want to maintain a bright, blonde hue. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an effective purple shampoo. 


### [Joico Violet Shampoo for Blondes (10.1 oz)](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Violet+Shampoo?utm\_term=joico-violet-shampoo-for-blondes-10-1-oz)

As someone with blonde hair, I know all too well the struggle of maintaining vibrant, brass-free locks. This shampoo promises to deliver just that, and I'm happy to report that it does not disappoint. 

The first thing I noticed about this shampoo is its luxurious texture. It's so smooth, it's almost like a cream, making it a joy to apply and massage into my roots. The subtle violet scent is another positive aspect, making my shower experience feel a bit more like a spa treatment. 

As I rinsed the shampoo out, I could already see the difference in the tone of my hair. The yellow tones that had been creeping in were gone, and my blonde locks looked brighter and more vibrant than ever before. In terms of cleansing, the shampoo does a great job of removing dirt and impurities, leaving my hair feeling fresh and clean. 

Now, for the cons. With a price tag of $10, it's not the cheapest shampoo on the market. While it's effective, I'm not sure it's worth the extra cost when compared to other options out there. Also, if you're sensitive to sulfates, be aware that this shampoo contains sulfates – some users have reported irritation as a result. 

Overall, the Joico Blonde Life Violet Shampoo is a solid choice for those looking to maintain and enhance their blonde hair. While it's a bit pricier than some other options, the results are worth it. Just be mindful of the sulfate content if you're sensitive to it.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Violet+Shampoo?utm_term=kerastase-blond-absolu-ultra-violet-violet-shampoo-for-blond-or-discolored-hair"><img alt="kerastase-blond-absolu-bain-ultra-violet-shampoo-1000-ml-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/kerastase-blond-absolu-bain-ultra-violet-shampoo-1000-ml-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

In my quest for the perfect daily care for my lovely blonde hair, I stumbled upon the Kerastase Blond Absolu Bain Ultra-Violet. I decided to give it a try as it boasted some serious anti-yellow and anti-copper benefits, an essential element for my hair type. 

This shampoo is like a superhero that turns the tide for an unwashed blonde. Its unique blue and purple pigments swiftly neutralise unwanted yellow and copper hues that can appear post-bleach, making it the perfect ally for cold blondes and grey hair. The shampoo does not disappoint as it offers a lasting anti-yellowing effect, ensuring the brightness lasts all day long. 

I was astounded by this shampoo's ability to protect my hair from daily oxidation and pollution. Combined with the hydrating hyaluronic acid and nurturing Edelweiss extract, it leaves my hair feeling incredibly soft, shiny and healthy. 

However, do not be fooled by the luxurious lather it provides. A little goes a long way, so applying too much can lead to a more difficult rinsing process. It's a small price to pay for the superb softness and shine it gives my hair though! 

Despite the price tag, it's definitely a product that's worth the investment. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a shampoo that goes beyond just washing, promising to keep your blonde radiant and nourished. It is truly a game-changer for those with blonde hair! 


### [L'ange Purple Toning Shampoo](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Violet+Shampoo?utm\_term=lange-purple-toning-shampoo)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Violet+Shampoo?utm_term=lange-purple-toning-shampoo"><img alt="lange-hair-violet-purple-toning-shampoo-restores-hair-color-tone-correcting-shampoo-removes-yellow-o-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lange-hair-violet-purple-toning-shampoo-restores-hair-color-tone-correcting-shampoo-removes-yellow-o-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I decided to give L'ange Violet Purple Toning Shampoo a try, as it seemed like a popular choice for people trying to maintain their blonde or gray hair color. The first thing I noticed was the packaging, which looked quite attractive and professional. However, upon opening the bottle, I was met with disappointment. The bottle was significantly smaller than I expected, especially considering the price. 

When I started using the shampoo, I followed the instructions carefully, massaging it into my hair and letting it sit for a few minutes before rinsing. I noticed an immediate difference, as my hair looked noticeably brighter and more vibrant. However, as I continued to use it, I started to notice a downside. The shampoo left my hair feeling quite dry and brittle, causing it to break easily. This was surprising, as the product claims to moisturize and enhance shine. 

Another concern I had was the scent. While it was described as having a light, fresh scent, I found it to be quite overpowering and almost too strong. It made me concerned about how it might affect my scalp and overall hair health. 

Despite these drawbacks, the shampoo did perform well in toning down yellow tones in my hair, giving it a more natural, blonder appearance. However, the negative aspects outweighed the positive for me. I would not recommend this product to others, as there are better options available in the market that provide the same results without causing dryness and an overpowering scent.

Using this shampoo and conditioner set has been quite the adventure and I've noticed a significant improvement in the overall health and appearance of my hair. The deep rich purple hue of the shampoo has made my highlights look brilliant, and the conditioner leaves my hair feeling bright, soft, and bouncy. 

The key ingredients like coco nucifera oil, hydrolyzed keratin, quinoa seed extract, and biotin have all contributed to nourishing and moisturizing my hair, leaving it feeling renewed and refreshed. The set is cruelty free and has made a significant improvement in the overall health and appearance of my hair. 

However, one minor downside is the packaging. While it still gets the job done, I would have preferred a pump instead of having to pick up the bottle and squeeze it. Overall, this Luseta Color Brightening Purple Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Blonde and Gray has been a great addition to my hair care routine.

For the best results, apply the shampoo to wet hair, massage it in, and leave it on for 1 to 3 minutes before rinsing. Be sure not to let it dry out your hair further, however, as this can be an issue for some users. Make the most of this shampoo with the conveniently sized 12 fl oz bottle and enjoy the long-lasting benefits of radiant blonde hair.

Another standout feature is the toning power of the shampoo. It's great for counteracting brassiness and increasing brightness in blonde hair. It's been a lifesaver for me since I've noticed my hair starting to look a bit dull in some areas. 

However, there are a couple of downsides to mention. Firstly, the scent is quite strong, and some might find it overpowering. Personally, I'm not a fan of strong fragrances, so I usually opt for a more subtle scent. Secondly, the price point is a bit higher than some other shampoos on the market. But when you consider the quality of the product, it's definitely worth the extra cost. 

Overall, I'm really happy with this shampoo and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to brighten their blonde hair. Just make sure to rinse it thoroughly, as the violet dye can be a bit stubborn. Apart from that, it's a fantastic product that I'm excited to continue using.

The first thing I noticed was the pleasant scent of the shampoo and conditioner; it had a light, refreshing fragrance that lasted even after washing. 

One of the standout features of this set is that it's sulfate-free, which was important to me as I've noticed that sulfates can sometimes strip my hair of its natural oils.

I've been using it for about two weeks, and I have definitely noticed a difference in my hair's volume and softness. 

While the shampoo is quite thick and requires a good amount to lather up, I found that it didn't dry my hair out, which was a concern I had. The conditioner left my hair feeling moisturized and detangled, making it easy to style. 

One downside I encountered was that the conditioner pump seemed to be broken right out of the box, resulting in a messy situation when I first tried to use it. However, I was able to find a workaround by transferring the product to a different container. 

Overall, I'm very pleased with the Purple Shampoo and Conditioner Set from BELLISSO. It has added volume to my hair and left it feeling soft, moisturized, and stronger.
