I recently discovered the Glenwillow Home Upholstered Platform Bed and was intrigued by its promise of blending traditional and modern elements. Upon unboxing it, I couldn't help but notice the meticulous craftsmanship that went into constructing this beauty. With its rich color palette, it perfectly complemented the room's theme, making it a statement piece in my bedroom. 

Assembling the bed was a breeze, taking only a few minutes thanks to its simple instructions and easy-to-find parts. One exciting feature was the zippered compartment on the back of the headboard, which housed all pieces of the bed – proving handy when it's time to clean or relocate the bed. 

However, my experience wasn't perfect. I did face some issues with the mattress itself – it felt quite firm for my liking, making it difficult for me to get a comfortable and restful sleep. In addition, I noticed some construction flaws in the frame, causing it to wobble slightly. While customer service was extremely helpful, they were unable to provide a long-term solution that would ensure my bed remains stable. 

Overall, I found the Glenwillow Home Upholstered Platform Bed to be a visually appealing and well-crafted piece of furniture. Despite its flaws, I did appreciate the ease of assembly and the zippered compartment – but the firm mattress and structural issues were significant enough drawbacks to prevent me from giving this bed a glowing recommendation.

### Sizing and Measurements

Ensure the bed frame you choose is the right size for your mattress. Upholstered king bed frames are designed to accommodate a standard king-sized mattress, which typically measures 76 inches wide and 80 inches long.

Also, consider the clearance needed between the bedframe and the wall to allow for easy movement and to avoid damage to your walls or furniture. 


### Comfort and Support

The main purpose of a bed frame is to provide comfort and support. Consider factors such as spring tension, mattress height, and internal support beams. A higher spring tension offers more support while a lower tension is more focused on comfort. Mattress height is another essential factor, as it can impact the overall feel of the bed. Lastly, internal support beams help distribute weight evenly across the entire frame, providing better support for both you and your mattress.
