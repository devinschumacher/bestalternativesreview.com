### [Rough Country Ultimate Protection Bed Mat](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Truck+Bed+Mat?utm\_term=rough-country-ultimate-protection-bed-mat)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Truck+Bed+Mat?utm_term=rough-country-ultimate-protection-bed-mat"><img alt="rough-country-rcm674-bed-mat-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rough-country-rcm674-bed-mat-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a truck owner looking for a bed mat to protect my vehicle from scratches, I came across the Rough Country RCM674 Bed Mat. The first thing that caught my eye was the description of it being made from 100% post-production recycled rubber/nylon material, which was an interesting touch. 

Once I got the mat installed, I noticed the precise fitment and custom molding, as well as the textured surface and true non-skid liner. These features made it a breeze to keep my cargo secure and in place. The abrasion and tear resistance of the knobby underside was a huge plus, as I knew this would keep my truck bed dry no matter what. 

While the full 3/8" thick recycled material was impressive, it was a bit heavy to handle, especially when trying to lay it flat in the bed. The rubber material also had a tacky feel, which made it great for preventing items from sliding around but could be less than ideal for maneuvering things to the front of the bed. 

Overall, the Rough Country RCM674 Bed Mat is an excellent choice for anyone looking to protect their truck bed from scuffs, scrapes, and scratches. With its precise fitment, durable materials, and non-skid liner, it keeps your cargo secure and your truck looking great.

This BedRug bed mat is a great alternative to a traditional carpet liner for your truck bed. The 100% polypropylene construction provides durability that stands up to wear and tear while maintaining a cushioned, knee-friendly surface. Its slip and skid-resistant fiber ensures that items stay in place and provides a comfortable work surface. The waterproof, chemical, and stain-resistant material makes cleanup a breeze, and the mat's designed exterior ensures it won't absorb water.

### [Rough Country Truck Bed Mat](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Truck+Bed+Mat?utm\_term=rough-country-truck-bed-mat)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Truck+Bed+Mat?utm_term=rough-country-truck-bed-mat"><img alt="rough-country-rcm679-bed-mat-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rough-country-rcm679-bed-mat-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out Rough Country's RCM679 Bed Mat for my Dodge Ram 1500, and I have to say, I was quite impressed. Installing the mat was a breeze, as it just rolled out in my truck bed and fit perfectly. The textured surface and superior abrasion resistance ensure that my cargo stays secure and my truck bed stays dry. 

One of the things that really stood out to me was the thickness and durability of the mat. Made from a recycled rubber compound, the RCM679 Bed Mat is nearly indestructible. The heavy-duty construction allows it to hold up to heavy equipment and harsh weather conditions, ensuring long-lasting protection for my truck's bed. 

However, there were a few downsides to my experience with the mat. Firstly, the RCM679 Bed Mat came with a strong rubber odor, which I found quite potent. While the odor may dissipate over time, it was noticeable immediately upon installation. Secondly, the mat was quite heavy, making it a bit difficult to handle alone. I recommend having a friend help you with the installation to avoid any strain or discomfort. 

Overall, I would say that the Rough Country RCM679 Bed Mat is a great investment for anyone looking to protect their truck's bed from scuffs, scrapes, and scratches. Despite some minor concerns, the mat has proven to be durable, effective, and easy to install.

But overall, the Dee Zee DZ86974 Bed Mat is a solid choice for anyone looking to give their truck bed the protection it deserves. 


### [Resilia Universal Truck Bed Mat - Durable Protection for All Vehicles](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Truck+Bed+Mat?utm\_term=resilia-universal-truck-bed-mat-durable-protection-for-all-vehicles)

Recently, I tried out the Resilia Truck Bed Mat Liner for my SUV, and let me tell you, it was quite the experience.

This heavy-duty, all-weather mat is made from industrial-strength PVC material, making it super durable and easy to customize to fit any size. 

What really stood out to me was how easy it was to clean. Even with the most stubborn stains, a quick hose rinse did the trick. However, I did notice that it can be a bit slippery when wet. Other than that, I was quite satisfied with the performance of this product. Plus, the fact that it's proudly made in the U. S. A. adds a nice touch. 

Of course, there were a couple of drawbacks. I found the sizing to be a bit inconsistent, and I had to return the one I received. Also, the installation process was a bit tricky, and I wish I had received more assistance with that. But overall, I'd say the Resilia Truck Bed Mat Liner is a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to keep their vehicle in tip-top shape.

Made from a 100% post-production recycled rubber, this product makes an environmentally friendly choice. The mat may contain trace fibers from recycled materials, which could be a minor concern for some users, but it does not impact the overall performance of the product. 

Installation of the Rough Country Bed Mat is a breeze, as it's easy to roll out and place in your truck bed. The mat is designed to fit models with a 5' bed and does not work with trucks equipped with drop-in bed liners. The mats are made in the USA, further adding to their appeal.

I've been using Rough Country's RCM680 Bed Mat in my truck for a while now, and let me tell you, it has made quite the difference in keeping my truck bed protected and clean. This heavy-duty mat is made from a 100% post-production recycled rubber and nylon material, ensuring its durability and eco-friendliness. 

One feature that stood out to me was the precise fitment and custom molding, which has made the installation process a breeze. The mat's textured surface and true non-skid liner have prevented my cargo from sliding around in the back and kept my truck bed nice and dry, even during the muddiest of adventures. 

Another aspect I loved was the abrasion and tear resistance. The knobby underside of the mat has provided excellent protection against scuffs, scrapes, and scratches, while the full 3/8" thick recycled material has proven virtually indestructible. The large Rough Country logo on the mat adds a touch of style without compromising the protection it offers. 

However, there were a few cons I noticed during my experience with the product. Firstly, the rolled-up mat took some time to fully lay flat in my truck bed due to the rubber's thickness and shape. Second, the mat may contain trace fibers from recycled materials, which might not be appealing to all users. 

Overall, the Rough Country RCM680 Bed Mat has been a game-changer for keeping my truck bed in prime condition. Its durability, eco-friendliness, and ease of installation have made it well worth the investment. Despite a couple of minor drawbacks, this mat has proven to be an excellent addition to my vehicle and I highly recommend it.

I recently put a BedRug Bed Mat in my truck, and I gotta say, it's been a game-changer. The 100% polypropylene surface seemed a bit pricey, but it's proven to be exceptionally durable.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a heavy-duty truck bed mat that offers a perfect fit and protection for your cargo, the Rough Country RCM673 Bed Mat is a great choice. Just be prepared to let it air out for a few days before using it for the first time.
