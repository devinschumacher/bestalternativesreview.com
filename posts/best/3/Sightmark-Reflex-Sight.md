<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Sightmark+Reflex+Sight?utm_term=redline-rl-torch-long-range-2-pin-sight-with-grey-lh-dovetail-mount"><img alt="redline-rl-torch-dovetail-sight-2-pin-grey-lh-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/redline-rl-torch-dovetail-sight-2-pin-grey-lh-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

One of the highlights of this sight is the two different pin sizes, both green, and the micro-adjustable feature. This makes shooting different distances easier and more accurate. The metal sight tapes or the option to use paper on the wheel is another nice touch, as it eliminates the need for heavy sight light knobs. 

However, the noise and stiffness of the dial can be quite annoying. Although I loosened the set screws, it's still not as smooth as I'd like. Additionally, the durability aspect of the sight is questionable. It doesn't feel as durable as the Black Gold slider sights I've used in the past. Furthermore, there was no manual provided for set up and adjustments, which would have been helpful. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, the features, adjustability, and vertical two pin sight under $300 make this sight a great option for the price. Overall, I'd give it a solid 4 stars for its performance, even with the issues I've encountered.
