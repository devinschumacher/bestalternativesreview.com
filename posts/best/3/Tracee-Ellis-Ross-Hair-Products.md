### [Strong Hold Hair Gel by Tracee Ellis Ross - 15 oz/425 G](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Tracee+Ellis+Ross+Hair+Products?utm\_term=strong-hold-hair-gel-by-tracee-ellis-ross-15-oz-425-g)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Tracee+Ellis+Ross+Hair+Products?utm_term=strong-hold-hair-gel-by-tracee-ellis-ross-15-oz-425-g"><img alt="pattern-by-tracee-ellis-ross-strong-hold-hair-gel-15-oz-425-g-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/pattern-by-tracee-ellis-ross-strong-hold-hair-gel-15-oz-425-g-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Last week, I decided to switch up my hair care routine and try out Tracee Ellis Ross's Pattern Strong Hold Gel. As someone who struggles to maintain her natural curls, I was curious to see if this product would make a difference. 

As soon as I opened the bottle, I was pleasantly surprised by the refreshing scent. The gel was smooth and easy to distribute through my hair, leaving it looking shiny and well-defined. However, what really stood out to me was the strong hold it provided – my curls stayed in place all day without any flaking. 

One downside I noticed was that the product is quite heavy, and I felt like I needed less product than instructed in some places. But overall, the strong hold, shine, and overall manageability of my hair were worth it. I'll definitely be incorporating Tracee Ellis Ross's Pattern Strong Hold Gel into my hair care routine in the future. 


### [Pattern by Tracee Ellis Ross Mini Wide Tooth Comb - Hair Care Essential](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Tracee+Ellis+Ross+Hair+Products?utm\_term=pattern-by-tracee-ellis-ross-mini-wide-tooth-comb-hair-care-essential)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Tracee+Ellis+Ross+Hair+Products?utm_term=pattern-by-tracee-ellis-ross-mini-wide-tooth-comb-hair-care-essential"><img alt="pattern-by-tracee-ellis-ross-mini-wide-tooth-comb-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/pattern-by-tracee-ellis-ross-mini-wide-tooth-comb-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the PATTERN Mini Wide Tooth Comb by Tracee Ellis Ross, and my experience was quite positive. One highlight for me was how travel-friendly this comb is. I've tried a few others in the past, but they were always too large and bulky for my on-the-go needs. This stylish mini comb was perfect for tucking into my purse or suitcase, making it a convenient choice for my beauty routine. 

As someone with naturally curly hair, this comb truly shined when it came to detangling my locks. The wide-set prongs glided effortlessly through my hair, gently separating and encouraging volume without causing any pain or damage. Whether I used it on wet or dry hair, I always felt confident that my curls would remain intact and not get frizzy or tangled up. 

One aspect of this comb that stood out was its design, which was specifically created for curls, coils, and tight textured hair - making it an ideal choice for those of us with curly hair. I also appreciated the recyclable packaging, as it's a nice touch knowing that the product's packaging is eco-friendly. 

While I had a great experience using this comb, there were a couple of drawbacks. First, the comb's size seemed to be somewhat limiting for those with thicker hair, as the teeth weren't long enough to effectively detangle them without making small sections. Second, the handle was a bit long, which made it slightly less comfortable to use for those with smaller hands. 

Overall, the PATTERN Mini Wide Tooth Comb by Tracee Ellis Ross proved to be a fantastic addition to my curly hair routine, and I highly recommend it for those looking for a travel-friendly comb that won't cause any damage to their curls. 


### [Tracee Ellis Ross Hair Pick by Pattern Beauty: The Go-To Hair Accessory](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Tracee+Ellis+Ross+Hair+Products?utm\_term=tracee-ellis-ross-hair-pick-by-pattern-beauty-the-go-to-hair-accessory)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Tracee+Ellis+Ross+Hair+Products?utm_term=tracee-ellis-ross-hair-pick-by-pattern-beauty-the-go-to-hair-accessory"><img alt="pattern-beauty-by-tracee-ellis-ross-hair-pick-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/pattern-beauty-by-tracee-ellis-ross-hair-pick-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer, I recently had the pleasure of trying out the Tracee Ellis Ross Hair Pick, and I must say, it's a game-changer for those with curly hair. The product exceeded my expectations in terms of ease of use and effectiveness. The extra-long prongs are a real highlight, as they help to shape styles, add volume, and elongate curls in a way that I've never experienced before. 

The luxurious large size of the Hair Pick is also a pro, as it allows you to cover a larger area while styling, eliminating the need to focus on small sections like you would with other brands. The thumb grip is a thoughtful detail, providing a comfortable and secure hold as you work your way through your hair. 

However, there are a couple of cons to mention. Firstly, the strength of the comb needs to be improved, as it does not manage thicker, curlier crowns well. I've had issues with the picks on the outside breaking, which is disappointing. Secondly, the size of the pick might be too large for some users, and it can be a bit cumbersome to use at times. 

In conclusion, despite these minor drawbacks, the Tracee Ellis Ross Hair Pick stands out as a valuable addition to any curly hair routine. Its ability to add volume, shape, and elongation to curls is truly impressive, and I would recommend it to anyone looking to elevate their hairstyling game. 


### [Portable Tracee Ellis Ross Mini Shower Brush for Easy Detangling and Defined Curls](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Tracee+Ellis+Ross+Hair+Products?utm\_term=portable-tracee-ellis-ross-mini-shower-brush-for-easy-detangling-and-defined-curls)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Tracee+Ellis+Ross+Hair+Products?utm_term=portable-tracee-ellis-ross-mini-shower-brush-for-easy-detangling-and-defined-curls"><img alt="pattern-by-tracee-ellis-ross-mini-shower-brush-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/pattern-by-tracee-ellis-ross-mini-shower-brush-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently gave the Pattern by Tracee Ellis Ross Mini Shower Brush a try. The first thing that caught my attention was its travel-friendly size, perfect for my on-the-go lifestyle. The premium features and comfortable handle made it feel luxurious in my hands. 

This little brush is a game-changer for detangling my curls – no more wrestling with knots in the shower! The heavy-duty material is gentle on my hair, ensuring that I keep all my curls intact. It helped define my curls and made them clump together for an effortlessly chic look. 

However, I did face a bit of a challenge when it came to cleanup. The bristles, while perfect for detangling, seemed to hold residue from my styling products, making them harder to clean. It's definitely a tradeoff to have such sturdy bristles that make my curls look so great. 

But overall, I'm very happy with this Mini Shower Brush. It's a great addition to my hair care routine, and I can easily carry it with me wherever I go. Despite the cleaning challenge, the pros outweigh the cons for me. 


### [Tracee Ellis Ross: Bounce Back Pre-Poo for Enhanced Hair](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Tracee+Ellis+Ross+Hair+Products?utm\_term=tracee-ellis-ross-bounce-back-pre-poo-for-enhanced-hair)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Tracee+Ellis+Ross+Hair+Products?utm_term=tracee-ellis-ross-bounce-back-pre-poo-for-enhanced-hair"><img alt="pattern-beauty-by-tracee-ellis-ross-bounce-back-pre-poo-10-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/pattern-beauty-by-tracee-ellis-ross-bounce-back-pre-poo-10-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried the Pattern Bounce Back Pre-Poo by Tracee Ellis Ross, and I must say, my curls are loving it! This product is a game-changer for my hair. The pre-poo formula is infused with elasticity-promoting oat extract and frizz-smoothing hibiscus flower extract, ensuring that my curls pop and my waves are prominent. The murumuru seed butter nourishes my ends, giving them a healthy shine. 

One of the standout features of this product is the scent. It's so pleasant that I even catch myself sniffing it throughout the day, feeling like I'm walking around with a bouquet of flowers. As for the packaging, it could use a little innovation. The current design makes it challenging to apply the product precisely to my hair without dripping through my fingers, but I managed to make it work. 

Another slight downside is the lifespan of the product. I found that I used nearly two-thirds of the bottle after just one use, which is a little disappointing. However, the results are worth it, and for that reason, I'll continue using this pre-poo to give my curls the bounce they deserve. 

Overall, I absolutely love this product and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a miracle worker for their curly hair. It's a must-have for those seeking softness, elasticity, and an effortless bounce in their curls.

I recently added Tracee Ellis Ross' Lightweight Conditioner to my hair care routine and I could not be happier with my decision. After struggling with overly heavy conditioners in the past, I finally found the perfect balance with this product. The creamy formula is great for detangling and hydrating my curls, without weighing them down. I also love the fact that this conditioner is silicone-free and free of parabens, phthalates, mineral oil, and other harsh chemicals. 

One of the standout features of the Lightweight Conditioner is its light and delicate scent, which is a nice change from the strong fragrances found in some other hair care products. The conditioner lathers up easily, leaving my hair feeling incredibly soft and manageable. The packaging is both eco-friendly and sleek, making it a great addition to my bathroom. 

However, there is a downside to this otherwise fantastic product. On occasion, the conditioner leaks during transit, resulting in a mess. While this does not affect the quality of the product, it can be quite inconvenient. 

Overall, the Tracee Ellis Ross Lightweight Conditioner is a great choice for anyone looking to nourish and strengthen their curls without weighing them down. Despite the occasional leak, it's an excellent product that I highly recommend.

First, I tried the hydration shampoo, which I found to be quite gentle on my hair. It lathered up nicely and left my hair feeling clean without stripping it of its natural moisture. However, I did feel like I needed to use a bit more to really get a good lather going. 

Next, I tried the leave-in conditioner, which quickly became my favorite part of the set. It has a light, refreshing scent that I found to be quite invigorating. I liked that it didn't weigh down my hair, but instead provided it with a nice level of hydration. My curls were left feeling soft, bouncy, and defined, which was a major improvement for me. 

Overall, I would highly recommend this Wash Day Essentials kit to anyone with curly hair. The hydration shampoo is a gentle, effective cleanser for curly hair, while the leave-in conditioner is a game-changer for anyone looking to define their curls and keep them looking fabulous. 


### [Pattern Beauty by Tracee Ellis Ross Hair Treatment Mask](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Tracee+Ellis+Ross+Hair+Products?utm\_term=pattern-beauty-by-tracee-ellis-ross-hair-treatment-mask)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Tracee+Ellis+Ross+Hair+Products?utm_term=pattern-beauty-by-tracee-ellis-ross-hair-treatment-mask"><img alt="pattern-beauty-by-tracee-ellis-ross-treatment-mask-15-0-fl-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/pattern-beauty-by-tracee-ellis-ross-treatment-mask-15-0-fl-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a beauty enthusiast, I've been using the Pattern Beauty by Tracee Ellis Ross Treatment Mask for a while now. The name itself caught my attention, and I was curious to see if the luxurious ingredients would live up to their promise. Overall, I'd say it's a pretty good product - not perfect, but definitely worth trying. 

One of the first things that stood out to me was the consistency of the mask. It's quite thick and gel-like, which took some getting used to, but once I got the hang of it, it worked well for my hair type. The subtle fragrance of orange blossom and geranium was also a pleasant surprise; it added a touch of luxury to my haircare routine. 

The key features that really stood out to me were the infusion of rice water ferment and moringa seed extract. These ingredients worked together to soften and strengthen my curls, leaving them feeling healthier and more resilient. I noticed an improvement in the elongation and definition of my curls, too, which was a nice bonus. 

However, there were a couple of downsides to using this treatment mask. For one, it did take a bit longer to rinse out than I would have liked, although I'm not sure if that's just a personal preference or if it's a more universal issue. Additionally, the mask does come with a hefty price tag, which might be a deterrent for some people. 

Despite the minor drawbacks, I'd definitely recommend the Pattern Beauty by Tracee Ellis Ross Treatment Mask to anyone looking for a luxurious hair care experience. [It's a great option for those with curly or coily hair types who are seeking to restore some moisture and strength to their locks.](https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativesreview.com/blob/main/posts/best/3/Shampoo-And-Conditioner-For-Curly-Hair.md) Just be prepared to budget for it, and to experiment a bit with the application process to get the hang of it.

Pattern Beauty by Tracee Ellis Ross's Scalp Serum is a delight to use and offers a refreshing solution for soothing scalp relief. The hydrating formula, featuring Peppermint, Rosemary & Lavender oils, invigorates and cools the hair roots while providing a calming touch. 

This dermatologist-tested product stands out due to its antioxidant-rich ingredients such as Matcha Green Tea, Aloe Vera, and Panthenol, offering nourishing benefits. The serum's tingly sensation leaves your scalp feeling refreshed and free from itching, making it great for all hair types and styles. While some users have mentioned the consistency of the product, the overall benefits seem to outweigh any minor concerns. 


### [Tracee Ellis Ross' Pattern Beauty Blow Dryer for Curly Hair](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Tracee+Ellis+Ross+Hair+Products?utm\_term=tracee-ellis-ross-pattern-beauty-blow-dryer-for-curly-hair)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Tracee+Ellis+Ross+Hair+Products?utm_term=tracee-ellis-ross-pattern-beauty-blow-dryer-for-curly-hair"><img alt="pattern-the-blow-dryer-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/pattern-the-blow-dryer-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a lover of Tracee Ellis Ross' hair products, I was excited to try her Pattern Beauty The Blow Dryer. In my daily routine, I have long, thick, curly hair that often takes ages to dry. I've always wanted a powerful blow-dryer to make the process less time-consuming, and this product seemed like the answer. 

Upon first use, the blow-dryer was a game-changer. With its powerful Ac motor, it dramatically cut down the time I spent blow-drying. Additionally, the ion generator smoothed my hair cuticles, resulting in a silky, frizz-free finish. The lightweight design and ergonomic handle made it easy to maneuver through my hair without causing any strain on my wrist. 

However, despite the many positive aspects, I did encounter a few drawbacks. The heat distribution was not even, which meant some sections of my hair took longer to dry than others. Furthermore, the attachments, although useful, didn't hold up to my extra thick hair. The brush attachment, in particular, had trouble handling my voluminous curls, leaving them tangled and unmanageable. 

In conclusion, Pattern Beauty The Blow Dryer is an impressive tool that can significantly reduce blow-drying time for those with curly or coily hair types. While it may not be perfect, with a few tweaks and enhancements, it has the potential to become a top choice among hair care enthusiasts.

Pattern by Tracee Ellis Ross Leave-in Conditioner stands out as a versatile hair product designed to hydrate and define curls without weighing hair down. With its subtle woody scent, reminiscent of Palo Santo, users can experience a luxurious and soothing fragrance while nurturing their locks. 

Tracee's passion for styling is evident in this product, as it not only hydrates but also adds soft-curl definition. Formulated with natural ingredients like jojoba oil, honey, and biotin, it promotes a healthy, moisturized appearance without resorting to harsh chemicals. It proves to be a popular choice among those with coily, curly, and wavy hair types, catering to a wide range of hair textures and thicknesses. 

Despite being slightly denser than some other leave-in conditioners, the formula effectively seals in moisture to combat frizz and dryness. This leave-in product fosters a sense of luxury and helps to reduce the lengthy process of curly hair care routines. Users appreciate the dispenser bottle and pump, as they facilitate easy and precise application. 

The most notable benefit of this product, as numerous reviewers point out, is its ability to leave hair soft, hydrated, and refreshed in a natural-looking way. Furthermore, it caters to sensitive skin, as its scent is rather subtle. This appealing feature ensures that it can be enjoyed by a broad range of users. 

Developed by Tracee Ellis Ross, this product is a worthy addition to any curly or coily hair routine.

### [Pattern Beauty by Tracee Ellis Ross Shine Spray](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Tracee+Ellis+Ross+Hair+Products?utm\_term=pattern-beauty-by-tracee-ellis-ross-shine-spray)

[Pattern Beauty by Tracee Ellis Ross Shine Spray is a versatile product that caters to a variety of hair types, making it a popular choice among users.](https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativereviews.com/blob/main/posts/best/2/Hair-Shine-Spray.md) With its lightweight formula, this spray provides the perfect sheen to enhance hair luster and protect against frizz. The absence of SLS/SLES, silicone, phthalates, and parabens in its formulation make it suitable for color-treated hair, ensuring a healthy and radiant appearance. 

One of the key features of this Shine Spray is its non-greasy sheen, which provides a natural glow to the hair without weighing it down. The formula contains Castor Oil and Plumeria Flower Extract, which work together to improve overall hair health and resist humidity. 

Using this spray is a breeze, as it comes with a convenient pump applicator. Simply hold the bottle 6-12 inches away from your hair and lightly mist the product in quick, uniform strokes. Reapplication is possible as needed for a refreshed shine. 

Apart from its shine-enhancing properties, this Pattern Beauty Shine Spray also helps detangle the hair, making it a two-in-one product for those who struggle with knots and tangles. Moreover, it leaves hair feeling soft and manageable, making it a great choice for styling as well. 

However, despite its many benefits, the Shine Spray has drawn mixed reviews regarding its scent. While some users appreciate its pleasant aroma, others find it too strong and lasting. Nonetheless, this minor drawback does not seem to outweigh the overall positive experience with the product. 

In conclusion, the Pattern Beauty by Tracee Ellis Ross Shine Spray offers a lightweight, non-greasy sheen that caters to different hair types. Combined with its ability to protect against humidity, detangle, and provide a soft finish, this spray is a must-have addition to any hair care routine. The only caveat is its potentially overpowering scent, but this does not detract from its overall effectiveness and popularity. 


### [Pattern Beauty by Tracee Ellis Ross Curl Mousse - Ultra-Light Volume for Textured Hair](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Tracee+Ellis+Ross+Hair+Products?utm\_term=pattern-beauty-by-tracee-ellis-ross-curl-mousse-ultra-light-volume-for-textured-hair)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Tracee+Ellis+Ross+Hair+Products?utm_term=pattern-beauty-by-tracee-ellis-ross-curl-mousse-ultra-light-volume-for-textured-hair"><img alt="pattern-beauty-by-tracee-ellis-ross-curl-mousse-8-0-fl-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/pattern-beauty-by-tracee-ellis-ross-curl-mousse-8-0-fl-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried Tracee Ellis Ross' Curl Mousse and was pleasantly surprised by the results. As someone with fine, wavy hair, I often find mousse to be too heavy and weigh my hair down, but this product was different - lightweight and fluffy, it gave my hair just the right amount of volume without making it feel weighed down. 

One of the standout features of this mousse is its ability to dry quickly without leaving any flakes. This was a huge plus for me as I've tried other mousses in the past that left annoying flakes in my hair after styling. The formula also held my curls in place without making them feel crunchy or stiff, which I've experienced with some other curl-enhancing products. 

Another aspect I appreciated about this mousse is its pleasant scent. It has a subtle, clean aroma that reminded me of freshly washed hair, and I didn't detect any harsh or overpowering fragrances. 

However, there were a few areas where the mousse fell short for me. Despite claiming to work for all curl patterns from 3B to 4C, I felt that my hair needed a bit more definition at the roots. The product also didn't last as long as I'd have liked; by the second day, my curls had started to lose their bounce and shine. 

Overall, Tracee Ellis Ross' Curl Mousse is a great option for those with fine, wavy hair who are looking for a lightweight product to enhance their curls without weighing them down. With a few tweaks in formula or application, I believe this mousse has the potential to be even more versatile and effective for a wider range of curl types.

### [Deep Scalp Detox Hair Cleanser by PATTERN](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Tracee+Ellis+Ross+Hair+Products?utm\_term=deep-scalp-detox-hair-cleanser-by-pattern)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Tracee+Ellis+Ross+Hair+Products?utm_term=deep-scalp-detox-hair-cleanser-by-pattern"><img alt="pattern-beauty-by-tracee-ellis-ross-deep-scalp-detox-4-0-fl-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/pattern-beauty-by-tracee-ellis-ross-deep-scalp-detox-4-0-fl-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've recently given Tracee Ellis Ross' Deep Scalp Detox a try and I must say, it's been quite the journey! The first thing I noticed is its intriguing blend of ingredients. The Australian Tea Tree Oil, pH-balancing Pink Clay, and Lemon Peel Oil seemed like the perfect trifecta to detoxify and purify my hair and scalp. 

Using it on my first wash day, I was initially surprised by the potent smell. It's quite strong, even for someone who appreciates the aroma of essential oils. But, in no time, it started to grow on me and became part of my new hair care routine. 

One thing I found a little concerning was the bottle itself. It's quite small, and I had some difficulty getting it open at first. But once inside, the product was easy to apply. However, I must admit that the application process felt slightly messy. 

In terms of the results, I've noticed a subtle difference in my hair's cleanliness. It's not a dramatic shift, but it does seem cleaner overall. The only caveat here is that I've got dry hair, so I've been experimenting with ways to hydrate and condition my scalp at the same time. 

Although I've only just begun to explore the product, I must say that it's a unique addition to my hair care routine. It's not without its quirks, but overall, I'm enjoying the results thus far. Despite its minuscule size, it's definitely making a big difference. 


### [Tracee Ellis Ross Curl Cocktail Hair Set: Perfect for Your Curls](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Tracee+Ellis+Ross+Hair+Products?utm\_term=tracee-ellis-ross-curl-cocktail-hair-set-perfect-for-your-curls)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Tracee+Ellis+Ross+Hair+Products?utm_term=tracee-ellis-ross-curl-cocktail-hair-set-perfect-for-your-curls"><img alt="pattern-by-tracee-ellis-ross-curl-cocktail-hair-set-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/pattern-by-tracee-ellis-ross-curl-cocktail-hair-set-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried the Pattern by Tracee Ellis Ross Curl Cocktail Hair Set and I must say, it was quite the experience! As a curly-haired girl, I was excited to try out these three travel-friendly haircare essentials. 

The set has a lovely scent, with notes of neroli, rose, and patchouli. The curling gel was impressive, delivering defined curls with a medium hold. I noticed that it was a bit lightweight compared to other gels I've used, which was a pleasant change. 

The styling cream, on the other hand, did not work well for me. While it repaired some damage and left my hair shiny, it weighed down my curls, causing them to lose their definition. I ended up using less product than recommended, as more would lead to an oily buildup. 

Lastly, the leave-in conditioner seemed to dry out my hair, even though it was meant to repair damaged areas. Despite its rich formula, it left my hair feeling dry and brittle, which was surprising given the other positive attributes of the products. 

Overall, I enjoyed the curling gel and its lightweight formula, but I found the styling cream and leave-in conditioner to be less effective for my hair type. It's a shame, as I was really hoping to find a set that worked well for my curls. Nevertheless, the travel-friendly packaging and the delightful scent make it worth considering for those with similar hair types. 


### [Pattern Beauty by Tracee Ellis Ross Styling Cream](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Tracee+Ellis+Ross+Hair+Products?utm\_term=pattern-beauty-by-tracee-ellis-ross-styling-cream)

Living with kinky, coily hair can be quite the challenge. Trust me, I know all about it. But thankfully, the beauty industry keeps churning out products to help us tame our curls. I recently stumbled across the Pattern Beauty Styling Cream, and let me tell you, it has quickly become my go-to for those tricky twists and wash 'n' go styles. 

I initially fell in love with its lusciously creamy texture. It's just the right consistency, not too thick, not too sticky - it glides over my hair like a dream. The formula itself is packed with goodies like shea butter, cacay oil, and sweet almond oil, all of which work together to give my hair a serious dose of hydration and nourishment. 

But let's talk about the real star of the show: definition. This cream works wonders on my curl type. It helps me achieve those perfect ringlets or bouncy curl patterns that I've only dreamed about before. And the best part? It leaves my hair feeling incredibly soft, not at all sticky or greasy. 

However, no product is perfect, right? While this cream is great at locking in moisture, it does take a bit more product than other styling creams I've used. Also, I've noticed a slight residue left on my hair after using it, but nothing a quick wash won't fix. 

In conclusion, if you're grappling with kinky hair like me, the Pattern Beauty Styling Cream is worth a try. Its creamy consistency, moisture-packed formula, and knack for defining curls make it a top contender in the world of hair care. Now, let's hope they release a jumbo size option for those of us who can't get enough!

As a reviewer, I'd say the Tracee Ellis Ross Styling Cream for Curly & Coily Hair in the Palo Santo scent stood out for its luxurious feel and effective curl enhancement. Applying the cream to my freshly washed hair left me with touchable, moisturized curls that remained in place all day. One thing I particularly appreciated was the lightweight formula, which didn't leave my hair feeling weighed down. 

However, I will note that the scent, although pleasant, was quite strong for my personal preference. I felt like it was a bit much, especially when blending it with other hair care products. But overall, the cream effectively moisturized and helped define my curls with minimal fuss, making it a worthwhile addition to my hair care routine.

Next up, the Moisture Conditioner. This was a game-changer for me. I usually struggle with finding a conditioner that doesn't weigh my hair down, but this one was different.
