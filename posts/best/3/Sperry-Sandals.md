### [Sperry Men's Plushwave Dock Slide Sandal - All-Day Comfort for Poolside Wear](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Sperry+Sandals?utm\_term=sperry-mens-plushwave-dock-slide-sandal-all-day-comfort-for-poolside-wear)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Sperry+Sandals?utm_term=sperry-mens-plushwave-dock-slide-sandal-all-day-comfort-for-poolside-wear"><img alt="sperry-mens-plushwave-dock-slide-flat-sandal-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sperry-mens-plushwave-dock-slide-flat-sandal-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Oh, these Sperry Men's Plushwave Dock Slide [Flat Sandals](https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativesreview.com/blob/main/posts/best/2/Flat-Sandals.md), they're quite something! I've had the chance to try them out and let me tell you, they're the perfect blend of comfort and style. The leather and nubuck uppers give a premium feel, and the easy on/off design is a game-changer for those poolside adventures! 

While they're not the most stylish type of footwear, they do have their place. And hey, if you're looking for a classic, leather-upper slip-on, these might be worth a try. They're comfortable, lightweight, and simple - the perfect summer companion. 

One thing that did catch my attention, though, was the durability. I've had my eye on some Sperry slides in the past, and they were much sturdier and more comfortable. Not to mention, they lasted a whole lot longer. I can only hope Sperry brings back that old style for those who prefer sturdier slides. 

But all in all, it's a pretty good balance of comfort and style. And if you're looking for a no-frills slip-on to add to your collection, these might just be the perfect fit. Just remember, you'll need to size up - they tend to run a bit large.

### [Sperry Waveside Plushwave Backstrap Women's Sandals - Ivory (Size 8 M)](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Sperry+Sandals?utm\_term=sperry-waveside-plushwave-backstrap-womens-sandals-ivory-size-8-m)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Sperry+Sandals?utm_term=sperry-waveside-plushwave-backstrap-womens-sandals-ivory-size-8-m"><img alt="sperry-waveside-plushwave-backstrap-womens-sandals-ivory-8-m-b-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/sperry-waveside-plushwave-backstrap-womens-sandals-ivory-8-m-b-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been wearing the Sperry Waveside Plushwave Backstrap sandals for a few weeks now, and I must say they've been a game-changer for my summer footwear collection. The first thing that caught my attention was the textured leather upper; it not only looks great but also provides a snug fit that keeps my feet comfortable all day long. 

The open round-toe design and thong with tonal skip lacing make these sandals super easy to slip on and off, which is a major plus for those who are always on the go. The double strap upper with an adjustable back strap allows me to customize the fit to my preference, ensuring that these sandals stay in place even during my most active days. 

One of the most impressive features of these sandals is the PLUSHWAVE technology. It provides amazing cushioning and added bounce, enhancing my grip and rebound with every step I take. This feature alone makes these sandals a fantastic choice for those who need a bit of extra support during their daily activities. 

However, no product is perfect, and I've encountered a few minor issues with the Sperry Waveside Plushwave Backstrap sandals. For instance, they tend to collect dust and dirt quite easily, which requires more frequent cleanings than I'd prefer. Additionally, the non-marking rubber outsole with molded Wave-Siping technology could have provided even better traction in some of the most challenging terrains. 

Overall, the Sperry Waveside Plushwave Backstrap sandals have become a trusted choice for me when it comes to comfortable, supportive footwear. While there are a few areas where they could be improved, the pros definitely outweigh the cons in my experience.

With attention to detail in the grommet design and rawhide thong, these sandals boast an unmistakable sense of style. 

While reviews express great satisfaction with the comfort, durability, and overall appearance, some users have encountered issues with sole consistency and the size of the sandals. Users have reported sole detachment and a slightly narrower profile than expected, as well as difficulties in finding the right fit. Despite these minor concerns, the Sperry Men's Outer Banks remain a popular choice for those seeking stylish, comfortable, and practical footwear.

The soft webbing across the foot made them feel secure but not restrictive. I also appreciated the lightweight EVA outsole, which provided a comfortable and supportive wear experience. 

However, there were a few downsides to these sandals. The first issue I encountered was sizing. I ordered a size that I usually wear, but it was a bit too narrow for my foot.

Despite the minor sizing issues and a bit of difficulty when my feet were wet, the Sperry Unisex-Child Calypso Sandal is still a great choice for summer footwear.

### [Sperry Men's Brown / Gum Float Thong Sandals - Size 12](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Sperry+Sandals?utm\_term=sperry-mens-brown-gum-float-thong-sandals-size-12)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Sperry+Sandals?utm_term=sperry-mens-brown-gum-float-thong-sandals-size-12"><img alt="sperry-mens-windward-float-thong-brown-gum-size-12-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/sperry-mens-windward-float-thong-brown-gum-size-12-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Sperry Men's Windward Float Thong in a size 12, and I have to say it exceeded my expectations. The sandal is designed to be perfectly suited for the beach and water sports enthusiasts out there. 

I was immediately struck by the lightweight, one-piece design of the sandal. It's made with 100% EVA foam, which is buoyant, making it ideal for those days when you're splashing around in the water. The wave-contoured footbed provides all-day comfort, and it boasts zero water absorption, keeping my feet nice and dry even after hours of use.

These components offer exceptional shock absorption, making the sandals extremely comfortable for long-wear even on rough surfaces. The sandals also have a secure slip-on closure that keeps them securely in place while wading through the water. 

However, there were a couple of things that could have been improved. Firstly, the footprint was larger than I expected, which made them less suitable for smaller boats. Additionally, the straps felt a bit tight, so I would recommend going up a size for a more comfortable fit. 

Overall, I really enjoyed using the Sperry Men's Windward Float Thong, and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a durable and comfortable pair of sandals for their water adventures.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Sperry+Sandals?utm_term=sperry-top-sider-womens-grey-float-slide-sandal-size-6"><img alt="sperry-top-sider-womens-float-slide-in-grey-size-6-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sperry-top-sider-womens-float-slide-in-grey-size-6-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Sperry Float Slide caught my attention with its promise of unbeatable comfort and zero water absorption. At first, I was hesitant about how well it would hold up during an outdoor adventure since I'm used to the traditional heavy sandals. However, I gave it a try and was pleasantly surprised. 

These versatile slides are lightweight and perfect for both poolside and casual outings. The upper part is made of EVA, a synthetic material that is both water-resistant and lightweight. I found the fit to be true to size, with no need for extra space around my toes. The sole is composed of a thick, cushiony EVA material that provided support and cushioning when walking on rough surfaces. 

One drawback, though, is that the Float Slide lacks proper arch support. I personally didn't notice this too much, but some users mentioned that it could be improved. Additionally, the rubber sole is not very water-resistant, as one would expect from the product description. I had to wipe my shoes dry after stepping out of the pool, which was a bit inconvenient. 

Despite these minor issues, I really enjoyed wearing the Sperry Float Slide in Grey. The lightweight design and comfortable materials allowed for a stress-free, easy-going experience. It's definitely a welcome alternative to the traditional heavy-duty sandals I'm used to wearing.

### [Sperry Santa Cruz II Men's Sandals: Tan, 9 M (D)](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Sperry+Sandals?utm\_term=sperry-santa-cruz-ii-mens-sandals-tan-9-m-d)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Sperry+Sandals?utm_term=sperry-santa-cruz-ii-mens-sandals-tan-9-m-d"><img alt="sperry-santa-cruz-ii-mens-sandals-tan-9-m-d-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/sperry-santa-cruz-ii-mens-sandals-tan-9-m-d-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Sperry Top-Sider Plushwave Men's Thong Sandal - Tan Size 10](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Sperry+Sandals?utm\_term=sperry-top-sider-plushwave-mens-thong-sandal-tan-size-10)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Sperry+Sandals?utm_term=sperry-top-sider-plushwave-mens-thong-sandal-tan-size-10"><img alt="sperry-top-sider-plushwave-thong-mens-sandal-tan-size-10-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/sperry-top-sider-plushwave-thong-mens-sandal-tan-size-10-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

My experience with the Sperry Top-Sider Leather Thong has been quite interesting. On one hand, I appreciate the comfortable cushioning provided by the PLUSHWAVE technology, which made the sandals a perfect pair for my daily beachside walks. However, the straps proved to be too loose for my liking, slipping around my feet while I was walking. The issue seemed to be a design flaw, as the old pair I owned had straps that were more securely fastened around the sole. As a result, my current pair would often slip side to side, causing me to stumble and lose my balance. 

One of the biggest disappointments, though, was the color's durability. The blue hue on the foam footbed quickly started wearing away just a week after my purchase - a stark contrast from the sturdier materials and finishes I've experienced on my older sandals. 

Despite these downsides, the sandals are lightweight and stylish, providing a carefree, laid-back vibe on the beach. I've received compliments on the sleek two-tone leather, and I can wear them with various outfits, from swim trunks to cargo shorts. If Sperry were to address the loose straps and improve the footbed's material, these sandals would easily become my go-to footwear for beach days.

### Discover the World of Sperry Sandals

Sperry Sandals is a celebrated footwear brand that's famous for its iconic boat shoe and sandal designs. The brand's journey began in 1935 when Paul Sperry, the founder, brought about a revolution in the footwear industry with his non-slip boat shoe invention. Today, Sperry Sandals offers an extensive collection of sandals and shoes, each crafted with the same quality and comfort as the original designs, while catering to diverse styles and activities.

These sandals have become synonymous with timeless style, durability, and adaptability. They are widely adored by boaters, sailors, and individuals who love spending time by the water. However, it's crucial to note that Sperry Sandals are not limited to aquatic activities and have gained popularity for being an excellent choice for casual wear, travel, and leisure time.


### What Materials Are Used in Sperry Sandals?

Sperry Sandals are meticulously crafted from diverse materials to ensure comfort, endurance, and functionality. The most common materials include canvas, leather, and rubber. Canvas is utilized in the upper part of the sandal, offering breathability and comfort during extended wear. Leather, on the other hand, is used in the sole of the sandal, offering both durability and flexibility. 

For the outsole of the sandal, non-slip rubber is employed, providing grip and traction on wet surfaces. Other elements employed in Sperry Sandals include synthetic fibers and metallic hardware, enhancing the sandals' aesthetics and functionality. The brand carefully selects and sources these materials to deliver the highest quality, ensuring they withstand the demands of various activities.

### Are Sperry Sandals Waterproof?

Although not all Sperry Sandals are fully waterproof, the majority of models are designed to be water-resistant and can withstand water exposure. The employed materials such as canvas, leather, and rubber are protective against water damage. However, it's recommended to dry your Sperry Sandals after wet exposure to preserving their functionality and longevity.

For those involved in fully submerged water activities, Sperry Sandals offers waterproof versions, such as the Authentic Waterproof Collection. These sandals are specifically designed to provide dry feet while still maintaining the classic Sperry style and quality. Customers looking for waterproof sandals should look for the 'waterproof' label when shopping for Sperry Sandals.


### How Do I Care for My Sperry Sandals?

To maintain the quality and appearance of your Sperry Sandals, proper care is essential. Clean your sandals regularly using a gentle brush or cloth and mild soap or saddle soap. Avoid using abrasive materials or harsh chemicals, as they can damage the materials and impact the sandal's performance.

For leather Sperry Sandals, regular conditioning is necessary to maintain leather softness and suppleness. Applying a leather conditioner or saddle soap to the leather sections of the sandal and letting it absorb for a few minutes before wiping off excess with a clean cloth can help maintain water resistance and the longevity of your Sperry Sandals.
