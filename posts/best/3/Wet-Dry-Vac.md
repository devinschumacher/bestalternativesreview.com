Its 2-gallon tank capacity allows for handling more substantial cleaning tasks without the need for frequent emptying. Compatibility with DeWalt's 18-volt and 20-volt max batteries has been helpful in my experiences, although I have encountered some issues with lower-amp batteries.

There have been some downsides to using this vacuum as well. Some users have reported inconsistent suction power that necessitates regular filter cleaning and proper battery selection.

However, I did notice that the vacuum was a bit loud, which can be a minor inconvenience. 

The vacuum was also easy to assemble, which was a plus, and the maneuverability wasn't an issue. I did find the ease of emptying the vacuum to be a bit of a challenge, but overall, it wasn't too much of an inconvenience. The instructions were clear and easy to follow, but the maintenance aspect of the vacuum was slightly more complex than I had hoped.
