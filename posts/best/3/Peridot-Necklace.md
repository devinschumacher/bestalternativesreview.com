I recently had the pleasure of trying on the Peridot pendant necklace. At first glance, it exuded a serene charm which made it quite tempting. The lush lime green stone, coupled with the brilliant sparkle of the diamond halos, was simply enchanting! 

The quality of the materials was impressive - 14k gold ensured that it felt luxurious on the skin, while the intricate design of the diamond halos added an elegance that was hard to resist. However, I found that it was a bit of a struggle to keep the pendant in place. It seemed like the clasp was not as sturdy as I would've hoped. 

Aside from that minor inconvenience, the Peridot pendant necklace was a stunning piece that I wouldn't hesitate to wear for special occasions or everyday. It's a great way to add a touch of vibrancy to any ensemble.

### [Macy's Topaz Peridot Halo Pendant Necklace in Sterling Silver](https://serp.ly/amazon/Peridot+Necklace?utm\_term=macys-topaz-peridot-halo-pendant-necklace-in-sterling-silver)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Peridot+Necklace?utm_term=macys-topaz-peridot-halo-pendant-necklace-in-sterling-silver"><img alt="macys-topaz-1-4-ct-t-w-halo-pendant-necklace-in-sterling-silver-peridot-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/macys-topaz-1-4-ct-t-w-halo-pendant-necklace-in-sterling-silver-peridot-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Macys Sterling Silver Peridot Pendant Necklace is a unique piece of jewelry that adds a touch of elegance and class to any outfit. The pendant itself features a 7x5mm Emerald Cut Peridot stone, complemented by stunning white topaz accents. The shimmering beauty of this pendant really stands out, and the polished finish adds an extra touch of shine. 

One aspect that needs improvement, however, is the size of the pendant. As a reviewer who purchased this necklace, I found it to be quite small and disappointing. I wouldn't recommend this pendant for adults, as it appears more suited for children or individuals who are just starting to wear jewelry. 

In contrast, the 18-inch length of the necklace is just right for those looking to showcase the pendant without it being too overwhelming. The spring ring clasp keeps it securely in place, and the prong setting ensures that the stone won't be damaged easily. 

Overall, the Macys Peridot Pendant Necklace is a beautiful piece with a stylish design, but it may fall short when it comes to the size of the pendant. I suggest considering the size before making a purchase, so you are not left disappointed like I was.

The Kendra Scott Elisa necklace in rhodium peridot illusion is a stunning addition to any jewelry collection. Its lobster claw closure ensures a secure fit, while the chic, 15-inch chain with a 2-inch extender provides an adjustable length.

Crafted with a rhodium-plated over brass design, this necklace effortlessly elevates any outfit and makes for an enchanting present for a loved one. 

Despite its delightful appearance and durability, some users may find the weight of the necklace slightly noticeable. However, this trade-off maintains the impressive quality and charm of the Elisa rhodium peridot illusion necklace.

### [10K Gold Peridot Pendant Necklace for Women - 18 inch, 1/2ctt Green Gemstone](https://serp.ly/amazon/Peridot+Necklace?utm\_term=10k-gold-peridot-pendant-necklace-for-women-18-inch-1-2ctt-green-gemstone)

A few weeks ago, I stumbled upon this "10K Gold Round Peridot Pendant Necklace" while browsing for a thoughtful gift. The description mentioned a stunning peridot gemstone in the center, which really caught my eye. Excitedly, I decided to give it a try. 

The necklace arrived beautifully packaged, and upon opening the box, I was initially thrilled by the classic gold finish and the delicate peridot stone nestled at its center. It added an elegant touch to my outfit, and I was quite pleased with my purchase. 

However, as I started wearing it more, I started noticing something odd about the peridot gemstone. It didn't display the vibrant green hue that I had grown accustomed to and expected from authentic peridot. Instead, it seemed to be more of a muted, almost clear shade. 

I even asked some friends and they agreed, the stone looked more like a colorless diamond than a genuine peridot. It was disappointing because I had anticipated this gift to be even more special, thanks to the stunning peridot gemstone. 

Overall, the necklace is beautifully crafted and has an appealing aesthetic. But I must say, the description and the actual product did not align in this instance, which left me rather unsatisfied.

However, one aspect that could use a little improvement is the packaging. I wish it came in a more gift-worthy box or something you could actually wrap. But hey, it's a minor issue compared to the beauty of the necklace itself. All in all, the combination of the peridot's vibrant green hue and the diamonds is a winning combo, and the Macy's Peridot and Diamond Accent Pendant Necklace is a must-have for any jewelry lover.

### What is a peridot necklace and why is it popular?

A peridot necklace is made of peridot gemstones, which are formed from olive-green crystals of the mineral olivine. They have gained popularity due to their unique color and rarity. Peridot necklaces are also associated with ancient history and are said to have protective and healing properties, which adds to their allure. 

Peridot is particularly valued for its vibrant green color, which is achieved through the trace amounts of iron present in the crystal structure. Rarity also plays a crucial role, as peridot gemstones occur in very few locations worldwide, such as the United States, China, and Pakistan. The striking combination of color and rarity makes peridot a sought-after choice for jewelry enthusiasts and collectors alike. 


### What is the difference between peridot and emerald?

Peridot and emerald are two distinct gemstones that belong to different mineral families and have unique properties. Peridot is a member of the olivine mineral family and comes in the olive-green color. It is relatively rare and can be found in limited locations globally, such as the United States, China, and Pakistan. 

On the other hand, emerald is a member of the beryl mineral family and is known for its vibrant green color. They are more abundant and are often found in various locations, including Brazil, Zambia, and Afghanistan. However, the color of an emerald can vary significantly due to the presence of chromium, depending on the intensity and shade of the green. While both peridot and emerald share a similar green hue, they differ significantly in terms of chemical composition and geological origin.

### What are the various shapes and settings of peridot necklaces?

Peridot necklaces are available in a variety of shapes and settings, which allows customers to choose the style that best suits their preferences. Some common shapes include round, oval, cushion, and rectangle. Round-shaped peridot necklaces are often the most popular due to their versatility and ability to showcase the gemstone's unique color. 

In terms of settings, peridot necklaces can be found in a range of options, such as solitaire, cluster, and bezel settings. A solitaire setting showcases a single, prominent peridot stone on a delicate chain. Cluster settings, on the other hand, feature several peridot stones arranged close together to create a captivating design. Another popular setting is bezel setting, in which the peridot is secured within a metal rim, offering additional protection for the gemstone. 


### What is the durability of peridot gemstones?

Peridot gemstones have a durability rating of 6.5 to 7 on the Mohs Scale of mineral hardness. On this scale, a 10 is made of the hardest mineral, diamond, while a 1 is the softest. While peridot gems are relatively hard, they can be susceptible to scratching and chipping if not handled with care. To maximize the longevity of a peridot necklace, it is recommended to store it in a jewelry box or case when not in use, and avoid exposure to harsh chemicals and extreme temperatures. 

It is also important to remember that peridot is relatively rare and found in limited locations. As a result, it can be more challenging to source replacement parts or additional stones in case of any damage. Proper care and handling can significantly help in maintaining the lifespan and beauty of a peridot necklace.

### Do peridot necklaces have any special meaning or significance?

Peridot necklaces have been valued for centuries due to their captivating green color and relatively rarity. They have been popularized in contemporary jewelry collections and have gained significance for their aesthetic appeal and rarity. In the world of gemstones, peridot has long been known for its ability to evoke a sense of tranquility and to represent strength and courage. 

The deep green hue of peridot is believed to symbolize the warmth of the sea, linking it back to ancient Egypt. As part of Egypt's rich natural resources, peridot was seen as a divine gift from the sun god, Ra. It is also associated with the power of the sun, symbolizing resilience and vitality. While not necessarily carrying the same spiritual significance as many other gemstones, peridot holds its own charm and significance, especially within the realm of fine jewelry and fashion. 


### What is the ideal necklace length for peridot necklaces?

Choosing the right necklace length can greatly impact the overall appearance and comfort of your peridot necklace. The ideal necklace length depends largely on personal preferences and the design of the necklace itself. However, a popular and versatile length for a peridot necklace is around 16-18 inches. 

This length allows the peridot pendant to sit nicely at the base of the neck, complementing a wide range of outfits and styles. It is also a suitable length for everyday wear, as it is not too short to fall off easily and not too long to become cumbersome. However, you may also find necklaces available in shorter (for everyday wear) or longer (for special occasions) lengths, depending on the designer and collection.
