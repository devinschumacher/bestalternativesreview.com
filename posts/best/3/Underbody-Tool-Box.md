There's something comforting about having a sturdy tool box on your truck, and this Better Built 24-inch underbody tool box is just the ticket. It's a heavy duty model, so you can count on it to carry your gear safely. When I installed it under my truck, it struck me how much larger the cargo box was compared to my previous one. That extra space just feels like a game changer. 

The attention to detail is really impressive. The 100% fully welded seams and heavy duty diamond tread plate aluminum construction ensure that it won't rust, which means it's built to last. The heavy duty door cables prevent the door from getting too far open when you're working on something close to the frame. The weather resistant seals and lip that pops out when closed help keep the elements at bay. The entire setup is weatherproof, so it won't get damaged even after a stormy night. 

The zinc-coated T-handle latches provide a great locking mechanism. I really appreciate this extra security, especially when I'm leaving my truck unattended for an extended period. Plus, the truck bed box itself is a nice addition to my vehicle, giving me the extra space I need. It complements my truck very well, and I've already been able to use it for a few road trips. 

With everything considered, there are a few things I wished the product had. For example, it would have been nice to have an LED light option in the cargo box for better visibility. But even with these minor considerations, this underbody tool box has proven to be an indispensable addition for my truck. 

So, if you're in the market for a rugged, weather-proof underbody storage box, this Better Built model could be a great fit for you. It's sturdy, spacious, and convenient to use.

## FAQ


### What is an underbody tool box?

An underbody tool box is a uniquely designed storage solution that fits underneath various vehicles. It provides a secure and well-organized space for mechanical tools, spare parts, and other equipment. This accessory is particularly helpful for mechanics and automobile enthusiasts who need to access their tools while working on their vehicles with ease.

Underbody tool boxes are commonly made from durable materials such as steel or aluminum, ensuring longevity and resistance to regular wear and tear.


### What are the benefits of using an underbody tool box?

Using an underbody tool box comes with several advantages compared to traditional storage methods. Firstly, it provides a dedicated storage space, making it easier to track individual items and minimize clutter within the vehicle. This results in a clean and organized appearance while also preventing tools from moving around and getting damaged during transportation.

Secondly, underbody tool boxes are highly accessible. Being designed to fit underneath a vehicle, they can be easily reached when working on the car or truck. This saves time and effort, as mechanics and automobile enthusiasts no longer need to search through cluttered trunks or cargo areas to find the tools they require.

Moreover, the storage offered by an underbody tool box protects tools from dust, moisture, and other environmental hazards that may cause damage over time.


### What materials are underbody tool boxes typically made from?

Underbody tool boxes are typically constructed from robust materials like steel or aluminum. These materials possess several advantages over lighter, more economical options such as plastic or fabric. Both steel and aluminum are known for their strength, durability, and resistance to damage from regular use and exposure to harsh environments.

Steel is the more popular choice for underbody tool boxes due to its strength and affordability. However, aluminum models may be a better option for those who prioritize weight reduction or value the added corrosion resistance offered by aluminum.

Despite the higher cost, aluminum tool boxes are generally lighter, making them easier to handle and transport, particularly when full of tools and equipment.


### What factors should I consider when choosing an underbody tool box?

Selecting the ideal underbody tool box requires considering the following factors to ensure it meets your specific needs and car's make or model:

* Consider the size - it should be large enough to accommodate your tools and equipment but not so big that it becomes difficult to install or maneuver.

* Determine the material - steel is stronger and more affordable while aluminum is lighter and more resistant to corrosion.

* Think about the installation method - straps, brackets, or custom fit systems may be used.

* Consider the locking system and any additional features like adjustable shelves or integrated lighting.

* Ensure compatibility with your vehicle's make and model, as some tool boxes are designed for specific types of cars or trucks, while others offer a more universal fit.


### How do I install an underbody tool box?

The installation process for an underbody tool box varies depending on the specific model and the vehicle you are installing it on. Generally, underbody tool boxes use one of three installation methods: straps, brackets, or custom fit systems. Straps are the simplest method, using adjustable straps to secure the tool box to the vehicle's frame or undercarriage. Bracketsrequire drilling holes into the vehicle and then mounting the tool box with bolts, while custom fit systems are designed specifically for certain vehicle types and use custom-molded mounting points for a secure and precise installation.

Regardless of the installation method, it is crucial to follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully to ensure a proper and secure fit. This may involve adjusting the tool box's position, tightening bolts or straps, and aligning it with the vehicle's undercarriage. In some cases, you may need to remove parts of the vehicle's interior or underbody to access the installation area. If you are unsure about any aspect of the installation process, consider seeking help from a professional or consulting the tool box manufacturer for guidance.


### What are some common issues to watch out for when using an underbody tool box?

When using an underbody tool box, you should be aware of the following common issues to ensure the longevity of your investment:

* Always ensure that the tool box is securely fastened to the vehicle using the appropriate mounting method and hardware provided by the manufacturer. A loose or improperly installed tool box can cause the box to shift or vibrate during use, potentially causing damage to the tools inside or affecting the vehicle's performance.

* Properly maintain the tool box and its contents. Regularly inspect the tool box for signs of rust, corrosion, or damage and address any issues promptly. Ensure that the tools and equipment stored inside the tool box are properly organized and protected from moisture, dust, and other environmental hazards that may cause damage over time.
