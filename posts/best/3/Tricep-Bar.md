I recently added the Cap Barbell 34" Standard Triceps Bar to my home gym, and I must say, it has made my tricep workouts so much more effective. One of the features that stood out to me was the diamond knurled hand-grips - they provide a secure grip, even without gloves. The bar itself is heavy-duty, which I appreciate in my workouts. 

However, there were a couple of drawbacks to this tricep bar. Firstly, the clamps for securing the weight plates are not included, so you'll need to purchase them separately. Secondly, the chrome finish can be a bit of a fingerprint magnet – I found myself having to clean the bar more often than I thought necessary. 

Overall, I'm happy with my purchase. It's a solid bar that has made a significant difference in my tricep workouts, and I look forward to incorporating it into my fitness routine.
