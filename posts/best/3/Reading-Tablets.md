I recently got my hands on the Amazon Fire 7 Tablet 16GB in black, and wow, it's a game-changer! Perfect for catching up on your favorite shows, social media, or even some light gaming. The tablet is super easy to use, and it's not too big or too small, just right for on-the-go entertainment. 

One of the first things I noticed about this tablet is how quick and responsive it is. I love how it's so much faster than previous models, and it makes everything smoother, from browsing the web to playing games. The battery life is nothing short of impressive, too. I can go hours without worrying about charging it, which is a huge plus when you're out and about.

I've also found it's great for capturing life's moments with the built-in camera. While the camera quality isn't the best, it gets the job done, and it's really easy to use. 

Now, no product is perfect, and that includes this one. I've noticed that the touchscreen can be a bit finicky at times, and the charging speed isn't exactly lightning fast. But overall, I feel like the pros outweigh the cons. 

One thing that stands out is the Amazon Appstore. It has a wide variety of content, including streaming services, which I find super convenient. I also appreciate the parental controls, especially for families with kids using the tablet.

## Buyer's Guide

When it comes to selecting a reading tablet, it's essential to choose a device that offers a top-notch reading experience while being comfortable to use for prolonged periods. This guide covers the fundamental aspects and factors to help you find the ideal reading tablet.


### Screen Performance

The screen is a vital aspect of any reading tablet. You should opt for devices with high resolution, clear images, and accurate color representation. E-Ink screens are preferred by many readers, as they closely resemble the appearance of real paper and minimize eye strain. Additionally, consider the screen size - larger screens can be more comfortable to read from, but smaller ones offer enhanced portability.


### Battery Life

Long battery life is crucial for tablets designed for reading, as you wouldn't want your device to die in the midst of a captivating book. Seek out tablets boasting at least 8 hours of battery life on a single charge. Some models even offer adaptive brightness and screen dimming features to further enhance battery duration. Assess your daily reading habits and select a device with battery life that matches your needs.


### Comfort and Ergonomics

Since you'll probably spend several hours reading on your tablet, it's important to select one that feels comfortable to hold and use. Opt for tablets with lightweight designs and ergonomic shapes. Some devices come equipped with built-in stands or cases that facilitate hands-free reading. Moreover, consider the tablet's font customization options, which can contribute to improved readability and reduced eye strain.


### Storage and Connectivity

Make sure your chosen reading tablet provides ample storage space for your collection of e-books. MicroSD card slots can offer additional storage if needed. Wi-Fi is essential for downloading new books, but some models also feature cellular connectivity for seamless, on-the-go access. Bluetooth support can be beneficial for pairing wireless headphones or speakers, enhancing your overall reading experience.


## FAQ


### What is a reading tablet?

A reading tablet, also known as an e-reader, is a digital device designed primarily for reading electronic books, magazines, and other content in a digital format. These devices usually have a high-resolution e-ink display, a feature that provides a comfortable reading experience by reducing eye strain compared to other backlit screens. 

Reading tablets come with built-in WiFi or cellular connectivity, allowing users to download new content quickly and easily. They often include a long-lasting battery, making them an excellent choice for avid readers on the go. Additionally, reading tablets usually offer features such as adjustable font settings, note-taking, and dictionary support, enhancing the overall reading experience. 


### What is the difference between an e-reader and a tablet?

While both e-readers and tablets have touchscreens and can be used for reading, they cater to different needs. E-readers, or reading tablets, are designed exclusively for reading digital content, offering features optimized for reading such as adjustable font sizes and screen brightness. They feature E Ink displays, which use less power than LCD screens found on traditional tablets. 

In contrast, tablets are versatile devices suitable for both reading and various other tasks such as web browsing, video streaming, and gaming. They typically utilize LCD screens, which are great for reading in various lighting conditions, but can cause eye strain in prolonged use compared to E Ink displays. While some tablets focus on reading, a tablet's primary purpose is not just reading but multimedia consumption. 


### Should I purchase a dedicated e-reader or a tablet for reading?

The choice between a dedicated e-reader and a tablet for reading depends on your preferences and requirements. If you plan on reading primarily in various lighting conditions, a tablet might be a better choice, as LCD screens perform better in such situations. In addition, if you want a device capable of multitasking such as browsing the web or streaming videos, a tablet is the way to go. 

On the other hand, if you prioritize a comfortable reading experience and don't mind sacrificing some multimedia capabilities, a dedicated e-reader may be an excellent investment. These devices are specifically designed for reading electronic books and offer features tailored to that purpose, such as adjustable font sizes and screen brightness. Ultimately, the decision should be based on how you plan to use the device and your personal preferences. 


### What are the benefits of using a reading tablet?

Reading tablets, or e-readers, offer several benefits that appeal to avid readers. Their primary advantage is the E Ink display, which uses less power and reduces eye strain compared to traditional tablets with LCD screens. This is particularly useful for prolonged reading sessions, making the e-reading experience more comfortable. 

Reading tablets are also lightweight and portable, making them convenient for reading on-the-go. They offer features such as adjustable font sizes, dictionary support, and built-in dictionaries/thesauri, enhancing the overall reading experience. Furthermore, they provide a vast e-book store selection and the ability to read various file formats, giving users access to a wide library of reading material. Lastly, they have long battery life, ensuring that you'll have enough power to read for extended periods without worrying about charging. 


### Which reading tablet is the best, and why should I choose it?

Determining the best reading tablet can be subjective, as it depends on your personal priorities and preferences. Some popular options include the Kindle Paperwhite, Kobo Clara HD, Amazon Kindle Oasis, and the NOOK GlowLight 3. Each device offers unique features and benefits that cater to different users. 

If you prioritize a comfortable reading experience and prefer an adjustable warm light, the Kindle Oasis should be on your list. It is highly customizable, waterproof, and long-lasting. Additionally, its large front light can illuminate the screen for a comfortable reading experience in various lighting conditions. 


### How do I connect my reading tablet to Wi-Fi and purchase e-books?

To connect your reading tablet to Wi-Fi, navigate through the device's settings and look for the Wi-Fi or network settings menu. This may differ depending on the tablet's operating system. Follow the on-screen instructions to search for and connect to your wireless network. Once connected, you will have access to the tablet's app store or e-book store to purchase and access an extensive collection of reading material. 

Most reading tablets come with a pre-installed e-book store, making it easy to browse and purchase books. Some popular e-book stores include Amazon Kindle Store, Google Play Books, Kobo Books, and NOOK Store. Sign up or log in to these stores using your tablet, and explore their vast collections of books. Purchasing e-books is usually straightforward, with a user-friendly interface and payment options such as credit cards, PayPal, or even gift cards.
