### [Milwaukee M18 15-Piece Combo Kit with REDLITHIUM XC 3.0 Batteries](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Power+Tool+Combo+Kits?utm\_term=milwaukee-m18-15-piece-combo-kit-with-redlithium-xc-3-0-batteries)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Power+Tool+Combo+Kits?utm_term=milwaukee-m18-15-piece-combo-kit-with-redlithium-xc-3-0-batteries"><img alt="milwaukee-2695-15r-m18-15-piece-combo-kit-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/milwaukee-2695-15r-m18-15-piece-combo-kit-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Milwaukee 2695-15R M18 15-Piece Combo Kit is a versatile and powerful set of tools designed for efficient and quick projects. I've been using this kit for both commercial and residential work, and it has never disappointed me. The combo kit includes 15 tools, four 3.0Ah batteries, and a six bay charger, all enclosed in three heavy-duty contractor tool bags for easy storage and transportation. 

One feature that stood out to me is the compatibility with all M18 batteries and M18 chargers, making it a convenient choice for those already using this system. Additionally, the REDLITHIUM XC 3.0 batteries provide up to twice the run time, 20% more power, and twice the recharges compared to standard lithium-ion batteries- a definite advantage in my experience. 

The tools themselves are of high quality, with heavy-duty drills and drivers working efficiently even after taking a beating. The blower is particularly impressive, while the impacts work well. The band saw and vacuums work well dry, though I haven't needed to use them wet. 

However, one downside I've noticed is the smaller portaband saw included in the kit. It seems like a waste of space, and I wish they'd replaced it with their larger portaband saw. Additionally, a box that could fit both in my 2'x4' gang box and neatly contain all the tools in this kit would be ideal. 

Overall, the Milwaukee 2695-15R M18 15-Piece Combo Kit is a reliable set of tools, perfect for those who want a comprehensive and powerful set for their projects.

First things first, let's talk about the DCD708 Cordless Drill/Driver. It fits in tight spaces and is incredibly lightweight, which is perfect for someone like me who loves working on small projects. The DCF809 Cordless Impact Driver is my go-to tool when I need to drive in or remove screws. It's powerful and efficient, delivering 1700 in-lb of torque.
