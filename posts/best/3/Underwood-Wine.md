<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Underwood+Wine?utm_term=underwood-2019-rose-wine-vegan-gluten-free-and-flavorful"><img alt="underwood-rose-wine-2019-750-ml-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/underwood-rose-wine-2019-750-ml-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Underwood Rosé Wine: Pink Power in a 250 ml. Can](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Underwood+Wine?utm\_term=underwood-rosé-wine-pink-power-in-a-250-ml-can)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Underwood+Wine?utm_term=underwood-rosé-wine-pink-power-in-a-250-ml-can"><img alt="underwood-rose-wine-nv-250-ml-can-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/underwood-rose-wine-nv-250-ml-can-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently opened a can of the Underwood Rosé Wine, and it was the perfect companion for a late afternoon on the balcony, as the heat started to give way to a soft breeze. I appreciated how easy it was to crack open, pour into a glass (I actually have a few glasses specifically for cans), and enjoy. The color was a lovely shade of pink, and I could appreciate the hue even before taking a sip. 

As I took my first sip, I felt a pleasant zing of fruitiness. The raspberries really stood out, while the lemon added a zesty layer that didn't overpower the other flavors. One of the things I truly enjoyed about this wine was how it didn't require a fancy glass or a special occasion for me to savor it. 

While I've grown fond of this wine in its can, I do think that perhaps I'd appreciate it even more if it came in a bottle. There's something about the presentation and experience of uncorking a bottle that adds an extra touch of class to the act of pouring a glass. However, I can't deny that not having to worry about breaking a glass or dealing with a cork is a definite plus. Besides, once I start pouring, I'm 100% focused on the wine in the glass, and the convenience of a can has proven to be quite useful. 

Overall, I would say the Underwood Rosé Wine in a can is a fantastic choice for those looking to enjoy a splash of pink and a burst of fruitiness without the fussiness. I find myself reaching for it more often now, especially during those long, hot summer nights.

### What makes Underwood Wines an eco-friendly choice?

Underwood Wines are committed to sustainability and environmentally-friendly practices throughout their production process. One of the key aspects of their eco-friendly approach is their use of "Pet Nat, " a unique winemaking process that minimizes waste. By bottling their wines before the fermentation process is complete, Underwood reduces the need for additional steps, such as filtering, which can be energy-intensive and wasteful. 

Furthermore, Underwood Wines source their grapes from family-owned vineyards that use responsible and sustainable farming practices. By working with these small-scale, family-owned vineyards, Underwood supports local communities and ensures that their grapes are grown in an environmentally conscious manner. This dedication to sustainability makes Underwood Wines an eco-friendly choice that wine enthusiasts can feel good about supporting.
