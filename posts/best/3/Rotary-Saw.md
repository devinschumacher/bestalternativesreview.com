<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Rotary+Saw?utm_term=makita-5402na-16-5-inch-circular-saw-with-brake"><img alt="makita-5402na-16-5-16-inch-circular-saw-with-brake-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/makita-5402na-16-5-16-inch-circular-saw-with-brake-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Makita 16-5/16 in circular saw is an impressive piece of equipment, delivering powerful performance for heavy-duty cutting jobs. What stood out to me when I tried it out was the consistency of the blade rotation, thanks to the blade stabilizer. This feature ensures that the blade doesn't wobble during use, resulting in more accurate cuts. The electric brake is another great addition, boosting productivity and safety. 

While the machine is well-designed, one minor issue I've noticed is the noise level. At 87 dB, it's not as quiet as I'd like it to be. The placement of the trigger safety button is also a bit inconvenient, especially when wearing gloves. Despite these minor drawbacks, the Makita 5402NA is a reliable and effective circular saw that delivers excellent results.

The variety of 7 saws in 1 has really come in handy when I need to make quick and accurate cuts. What stood out to me in my experience was the precision cuts that it provides, which has been vital during my DIY home projects and craft sessions. Plus, the over 4200 RPMs makes it a smooth and efficient process. 

The ease of use with the thumb-controlled power switch and the safety switch that keeps the blade guard locked until I'm ready to cut has been a great feature, ensuring safety whenever I use the tool. Although it's lightweight, I found the carrying case to be incredibly durable, which has come in handy during transportation. 

However, one aspect that I felt could use some improvement is the weight. Although it's lightweight in the palm, some users have mentioned that it's heavier than expected, making it a bit difficult to use for everyone. 

Despite this minor issue, the Rotorazer Compact Circular Saw Set has become a go-to tool for my various home improvement and crafting projects, and I highly recommend it for anyone who needs a versatile, easy-to-use, and precise saw.

These versatile machines are designed to provide precision and efficiency when making angled cuts or cutting through different types of materials. In this buyer's guide, we'll discuss the essential features to consider, general advice, and important aspects to keep in mind while selecting the right rotary saw for your needs. Remember, these are general guidelines, and specific product picks or external resources will not be mentioned. 


### Power Source

Rotary saws are available with various power sources, including corded electric, cordless, and pneumatic. Corded electric models are typically more powerful and offer constant power, while cordless and pneumatic options provide more mobility. Consider your project's size and the need for constant power when choosing the appropriate power source.

### Blade Types and Diameter

Rotary saws come with different blade types and diameters to cater to various cutting requirements. Common blade types include wood, metal, and bi-metal alloy. Blade diameter ranges from 1 to 1-3/8 inches, with smaller blades being suitable for detailed work and larger blades for faster, rough cuts. Make sure to choose the right blade type and size to match your intended application. 


### Adjustable Depth of Cut

Adjustable depth of cut is a crucial feature in rotary saws, as it allows you to set the desired depth for your cuts. This feature ensures that you maintain consistent depth throughout your project and prevents accidental deep cuts.

Variable speed control is another essential feature in rotary saws. This feature enables you to adjust the cutting speed according to the material being cut and the desired finish. Faster speeds are suitable for rough cuts, while slower speeds are ideal for detailed work or cutting thin materials. Look for a rotary saw with a variable speed control dial for smoother and more accurate cuts.
