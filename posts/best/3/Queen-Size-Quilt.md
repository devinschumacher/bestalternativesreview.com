### [Paisley Floral Reversible Blue Bedding Set for Queen Size Beds](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Queen+Size+Quilt?utm\_term=paisley-floral-reversible-blue-bedding-set-for-queen-size-beds)

The quilt is also made of microfiber, which means it's easy to clean and maintain. It can simply be tossed into the washing machine, which was a real plus for me given my hectic lifestyle. However, I did notice a slight grease stain when I received it, but that didn't really bother me too much. 

The quality of the quilt is top-notch, with its soft, comforting texture being a standout feature. I particularly appreciate that it's not too heavy, making it a great choice for warmer seasons. It might even be a little too light for some, but I personally enjoyed its airy feel. 

One minor issue I faced was the size of the quilt, which was slightly smaller than expected. I mistakenly ordered a queen-size quilt, but it turned out to be just a hair too small for my actual queen-sized bed. It wasn't a deal-breaker, though, and I'm still very happy with my purchase. 

Overall, I'm thrilled with this Paisley Floral Reversible Quilt Set Bedspread in Blue. It's a beautiful, comfortable, and versatile addition to my bedroom that I know I'll continue to enjoy for a long time.

### [Soft & Stylish Queen Size White Textured Arched Cotton Quilt](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Queen+Size+Quilt?utm\_term=soft-stylish-queen-size-white-textured-arched-cotton-quilt)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Queen+Size+Quilt?utm_term=soft-stylish-queen-size-white-textured-arched-cotton-quilt"><img alt="better-homes-gardens-white-textured-arched-cotton-quilt-queen-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/better-homes-gardens-white-textured-arched-cotton-quilt-queen-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Recently, I had the pleasure of trying out the Better Homes & Gardens White Textured Arched Cotton Quilt in a Queen size. This quilt offers a great combination of comfort and style, and I must admit it caught my attention the moment I laid eyes on it. 

Before using the quilt, I was drawn to its lightweight design. Perfect for year-round use, this quilt lets you enjoy its soft embrace without weighing you down. I've used it on and off during various seasons, and it's consistently proved to be a good choice. 

One aspect that stood out to me is the quilt's fabric. Made of ultrasoft cotton and polyester, its comfortable texture is exactly what I needed. It's been a constant delight whenever I'm under its cozy sheath, and the fabric prevents overheating when the weather gets warm. 

Despite its numerous perks, the quilt isn't perfect. Its under fabric is slightly rough, compared to the outer fabric layer; this, however, is a minor hiccup that doesn't detract much from the overall experience. 

Another minor issue I faced is the quilt's size. It's slightly smaller than I expected, not fully covering the breadth of my comforter. But honestly, these issues hardly overshadow the incredible comfort and aesthetic this quilt offers. 

One last thing I'd like to mention is the care instructions. The quilt is machine washable, making it an extremely low-maintenance addition to my bedding. It retains its integrity even after several washes.

### [Double Cloth Queen Size Quilt in Cream by Threshold](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Queen+Size+Quilt?utm\_term=double-cloth-queen-size-quilt-in-cream-by-threshold)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Queen+Size+Quilt?utm_term=double-cloth-queen-size-quilt-in-cream-by-threshold"><img alt="full-queen-double-cloth-quilt-cream-threshold-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/full-queen-double-cloth-quilt-cream-threshold-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

With the Threshold Double Cloth Quilt, comfort and style are all rolled into one.

The cotton blend fabric not only provides a soft and cozy experience, but it also feels great to the touch.

One standout feature was the ease of cleaning. No need to worry about stains and spills – just pop the quilt in the washing machine and tumble dry. It's a relief to know that I can keep it looking fresh and clean without any hassle. 

However, one drawback I noticed was the consistency of the quilt. My first one had better quality and was thicker, while the second one felt thinner – suitable for warmer weather. I also found that the color of the second one had a hint of yellowing, which wasn't ideal. 

Overall, the Threshold Double Cloth Quilt offers a comfortable and stylish addition to my bedroom, but I wish the consistency and color were more consistent. 


### [INK+IVY Luxurious Imani Cotton Printed Comforter Set](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Queen+Size+Quilt?utm\_term=inkivy-luxurious-imani-cotton-printed-comforter-set)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Queen+Size+Quilt?utm_term=inkivy-luxurious-imani-cotton-printed-comforter-set"><img alt="inkivy-imani-full-queen-navy-cotton-printed-comforter-set-w-chenille-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/inkivy-imani-full-queen-navy-cotton-printed-comforter-set-w-chenille-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried the Imani Cotton Printed Comforter Set with Chenille from INK+IVY and I must say, I absolutely fell in love with it. The moment I took it out of the packaging, I was drawn to the stunning global inspired aztec print on the 100% cotton shell. It truly added a pop of color and charm to my bedroom decor. 

The comforter set is made up of a cozy, tufted cotton chenille for a sophisticated look. The hidden bartacks give the comforter a duvet-like finish, which I found to be quite comforting. The solid reverse complemented the eye-catching patterns perfectly, making it a sight to behold. 

What also impressed me was that the set included two matching shams, creating a stunning coordinated look. The shams feature an overlap opening at the back, which was a thoughtful addition. 

However, there were a few downsides to this experience. The comforter did come out of the washing machine looking quite wrinkled, but that's normal for cotton fabric. I also noticed some color bleeding from the chenille onto the lighter fabric after I washed it, but it wasn't very noticeable. 

Lastly, the comforter is quite lightweight for my preference; I prefer a heavier blanket for optimal warmth. But overall, I love the colors and print, and how fluffy, soft, and warm it is. This comforter set gives my bedroom a soft, mid-century look that I'm really happy with.
