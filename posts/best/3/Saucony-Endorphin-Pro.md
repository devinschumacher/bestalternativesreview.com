### [Endorphin Pro: Lightweight Saucony Shoes for Elite Runner Performance](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Saucony+Endorphin+Pro?utm\_term=endorphin-pro-lightweight-saucony-shoes-for-elite-runner-performance)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Saucony+Endorphin+Pro?utm_term=endorphin-pro-lightweight-saucony-shoes-for-elite-runner-performance"><img alt="saucony-endorphin-pro-mens-9-5-icon-navy-silver-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/saucony-endorphin-pro-mens-9-5-icon-navy-silver-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Having tried the [Saucony Endorphin Pro](https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativesreview.com/blob/main/posts/best/3/Saucony-Endorphin-Pro.md), I can confidently say that this shoe is a game-changer for dedicated runners. Designed for elite athletes, these shoes incorporate cutting-edge technology that promises to give runners a fair advantage at the starting line. With a lightweight build of just 7.5oz, one can't help but feel a surge of energy as they put these shoes on. 

The Endorphin Pro's most impressive feature is its SPEEDROLL technology, which combines the signature S-curve carbon fiber plate with ultralight PWRRUN PB cushioning. The result is an unparalleled race-day performance that will have you smashing personal records in no time. 

However, not all aspects of the Endorphin Pro are perfect. Upon taking them for a spin, I experienced a bit of discomfort, specifically with my ankle collar. It seemed to press unnaturally hard into the bottom of my ankle bone during stance phase, which caused me to prematurely end my run. I sincerely hope that Saucony addresses this issue in future iterations of the Endorphin Pro. 

Additionally, while the shoes boast an impressive weight, I couldn't help but feel that the price tag was a bit steep. Though the Endorphin Pro lived up to its speedy reputation, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of regret at the expense. 

Despite these minor shortcomings, the Saucony Endorphin Pro is a truly remarkable racing shoe. It's undeniable that these shoes were made for ambitious runners looking to push their limits and achieve new heights. 


### [Saucony Endorphin Pro 2 Vizi Gold/Vizi Red Running Shoes](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Saucony+Endorphin+Pro?utm\_term=saucony-endorphin-pro-2-vizi-gold-vizi-red-running-shoes)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Saucony+Endorphin+Pro?utm_term=saucony-endorphin-pro-2-vizi-gold-vizi-red-running-shoes"><img alt="womens-saucony-endorphin-pro-2-vizi-gold-vizi-red-11-b-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/womens-saucony-endorphin-pro-2-vizi-gold-vizi-red-11-b-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Women's Saucony Endorphin Pro 2 Vizi Gold/Vizi Red 11 B for a couple of weeks now, and let me tell you, it's been quite an experience. When I first put them on, I felt the same bounce I had experienced with my previous Endorphin Pros, but things quickly took a turn for the worse. 

One of the highlights of this shoe is its ultralight PWRRUN PB cushioning that gives you a springy feeling as you run. It's like a coating of cushion under your feet, propelling you forward with each step. However, what initially felt like a dream turned into a sore reality. The carbon fiber plate in the sole felt rigid and unforgiving, making it feel like I was running on concrete. 

The improved fit and support are a plus, but the shoe's stiffness caused me discomfort during my runs. I couldn't shake off the feeling of soreness, and I soon found myself dreading my regular runs. It definitely wasn't the comfortable, effortless experience I had in my previous pair. 

In terms of the aesthetics, I absolutely adored the Vizi Gold/Vizi Red color scheme. It's bold and eye-catching, making me feel like I'm running in an explosion of color. I also appreciated the fact that these shoes are made with recycled materials, which is a great step towards sustainability. 

However, the downside to these shoes is that for the price, I expected a higher quality product. I've come to rely on Saucony for providing comfort and support during my runs, but this pair failed to meet my expectations. It's disappointing to have to return to my old running shoes and postpone my new purchase. 

Overall, while there are some aspects of the Women's Saucony Endorphin Pro 2 Vizi Gold/Vizi Red 11 B that I appreciate, the negatives have vastly outweighed the positives. It's back to the drawing board for me, but I hope that future updates will address the issues I experienced. 


### [Saucony Endorphin Pro Women's Shoes - White/Black/Vizi](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Saucony+Endorphin+Pro?utm\_term=saucony-endorphin-pro-womens-shoes-white-black-vizi)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Saucony+Endorphin+Pro?utm_term=saucony-endorphin-pro-womens-shoes-white-black-vizi"><img alt="saucony-endorphin-pro-3-womens-white-black-vizi-10" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/saucony-endorphin-pro-3-womens-white-black-vizi-10/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Racing towards a new peak of athletic performance, the Saucony Endorphin Pro 3 is a game-changer for ladies seeking a fast, agile shoe. Crafted with a combination of speed and support in mind, this footwear embraces Saucony's iconic SPEEDROLL technology. Accompanying this, the shoe benefits from FORMFIT technology, providing a personalized fit for each individual runner. 

The enhanced PWRRUN PB foam cushioning, while delivering a snug and comfortable in-shoe feel, also ensures a smoother, bounce-back sensation underfoot. To provide an added edge of stability and responsiveness, an S-curve carbon-plate is incorporated within the structure. A 4mm increase in the foam cushioning is a testament towards the brand's commitment to maximizing performance without compromising comfort. 

The latest version is lighter than its predecessor, while still affording improved traction through a resilient XT-900 outsole. The upper is designed to be breathable and lightweight, a significant factor in long runs. 

Despite these positive attributes, the shoe also has a few downsides. Some users may find the shoe's sizing a bit off, with the toe box having less width and more material compared to its older brother, the Pro 2. This results in lesser flexibility and can cause discomfort for those with wider feet. 

To sum up, the Saucony Endorphin Pro 3 is an excellent, high-performance running shoe with notable enhancements such as its SPEEDROLL technology and PWRRUN PB foam cushioning. However, the width of the toe box and material could have been reconsidered for better fit and flexibility. A recommended choice for racers, but not without its flaws. 


### [Saucony Endorphin Pro 3: Fast Carbon-Fiber Plate Shoe for Competitive Runners](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Saucony+Endorphin+Pro?utm\_term=saucony-endorphin-pro-3-fast-carbon-fiber-plate-shoe-for-competitive-runners)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Saucony+Endorphin+Pro?utm_term=saucony-endorphin-pro-3-fast-carbon-fiber-plate-shoe-for-competitive-runners"><img alt="saucony-endorphin-pro-3-mens-prospect-quartz-12" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/saucony-endorphin-pro-3-mens-prospect-quartz-12/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Lacing up the Saucony Endorphin Pro 3 is like inviting pure speed to fuel your run. The carbon-fiber plate at its heart propels you forward with a lively bounce, as the thicker stack of PWRRUN PB foam provides additional cushion and comfort. But they're so much more than just a fast shoe. The Endorphin Pro 3 is built to take you further with its perfect blend of performance and style. The XT-900 outsole provides unbeatable grip on any surface, while the FORMFIT upper cradles your foot for personalized comfort. 

I recently put these shoes through their paces at a 5K event, and I couldn't have been happier with their performance. The added cushioning provided a level of comfort and shock absorption that I didn't expect from a carbon-plated shoe, making them a joy to run in. The updated geometry also felt like a perfect fit, making them feel lighter than their predecessor. 

What really stood out for me, though, was the grip. On several race-day corners, I could feel the Saucony Endorphin Pro 3 biting into the ground, providing a level of stability and confidence that I haven't found in many other shoes. Whether you're running a city marathon or a muddy trail race, these shoes are the perfect companion. 

However, the one thing that might put people off is the width. I had to go up a size in the Endorphin Pro 3 compared to the Saucony Runners I'd previously used. The narrower toe box could be a struggle for those with wider feet, as it restricts pinky toe movement. But for those with a regular-width foot, the Endorphin Pro 3 is a stunning piece of engineering that will supercharge your running performance. 


### [Saucony Endorphin Pro 3: Men's Running Shoe in White-Gold / 13](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Saucony+Endorphin+Pro?utm\_term=saucony-endorphin-pro-3-mens-running-shoe-in-white-gold-13)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Saucony+Endorphin+Pro?utm_term=saucony-endorphin-pro-3-mens-running-shoe-in-white-gold-13"><img alt="saucony-mens-endorphin-pro-3-white-gold-14" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/saucony-mens-endorphin-pro-3-white-gold-14/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

In my quest to find the perfect running shoe, I've tried a lot of Saucony models, from the Runners series to the Endorphin Pro lineage. But there was something magical about the Saucony Pro 3 that drew me in from the get-go. I quickly realized that this wasn't just another pair of running shoes; these were a whole new kind of game-changer for me. 

The first thing I noticed was the seamless integration of the PWRRUN PB foam cushioning with the carbon-fiber plate. It provided more than just a comfortable and lightweight cushion under my feet; it felt like an energetic springboard that propelled me effortlessly forward with each stride. The 31.5 mm forefoot stack height and 14.4 ounce weight of the Pro 3 were perfectly balanced to give me both agility and endurance, allowing me to push my limits and run with ease. 

However, the Pro 3's breathable, lightweight mesh upper and FORMFIT design, which hugged my foot for a personalized fit, were a bit of a mixed blessing for me. While the Formfit ensured a snug, comfortable fit, it made my wide feet feel a bit cramped, especially since the toe box wasn't quite as roomy as that of the Pro 2's. 

Despite this minor inconvenience, the Pro 3 stood out in a crowd thanks to its SPEEDROLL technology, XT-900 carbon rubber outsole, and eco-conscious, recycled materials, all wrapped up in that vegan-friendly packaging. So when push comes to shove, the Saucony Pro 3 definitely deserves its place among the top running shoes on the market. Just remember to size up if you have wide feet like me! 


### [Saucony Men's Endorphin Pro 3: Carbon-Plated Shoe for Effortless Speed and Ultimate Comfort](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Saucony+Endorphin+Pro?utm\_term=saucony-mens-endorphin-pro-3-carbon-plated-shoe-for-effortless-speed-and-ultimate-comfort)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Saucony+Endorphin+Pro?utm_term=saucony-mens-endorphin-pro-3-carbon-plated-shoe-for-effortless-speed-and-ultimate-comfort"><img alt="saucony-mens-endorphin-pro-3-white-gold-15" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/saucony-mens-endorphin-pro-3-white-gold-15/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Saucony Men's Endorphin Pro 3 is a versatile running shoe that strikes a balance between comfort, cushioning, and speed. Its SPEEDROLL technology and carbon-fiber plate work together to provide effortless propulsion, while the stack of PWRRUN PB foam ensures a responsive and energy-efficient ride. The updated geometry and additional stack height provide increased cushioning and comfort without adding unnecessary weight. The XT-900 outsole offers excellent grip on various surfaces, making it suitable for a wide range of running terrains. 

However, some users may find the toe box slightly narrow, which could be an issue for those with wider feet. The shoe's FORMFIT design aims to provide a snug and personalized fit, but it might require some break-in time for maximum comfort. Additionally, the new version seems to be slightly heavier than its predecessor, which could be noticed during longer runs. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, the Saucony Endorphin Pro 3 remains an impressive choice for runners looking for a fast, comfortable, and well-cushioned shoe. Its carbon-plated construction and advanced foam technology offer a unique combination that makes it stand out in the running shoe market. Whether you're training for your next marathon or simply enjoy pushing your limits with every stride, the Endorphin Pro 3 is a worthy companion on your running journey.

I appreciated the shoe's fit, which hugs every corner of my foot, offering a snug yet breathable experience.

Overall, the Saucony Endorphin Pro 3 is a high-quality running shoe that delivers both comfort and performance. It's worth considering if you're looking to up your speed game without sacrificing the cushioning you need for a comfortable run.

### [Saucony Endorphin Pro 3: High-Performance Running Shoe for Men (Black/Goldstruck)](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Saucony+Endorphin+Pro?utm\_term=saucony-endorphin-pro-3-high-performance-running-shoe-for-men-black-goldstruck)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Saucony+Endorphin+Pro?utm_term=saucony-endorphin-pro-3-high-performance-running-shoe-for-men-black-goldstruck"><img alt="saucony-endorphin-pro-3-mens-black-goldstruck-8-6" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/saucony-endorphin-pro-3-mens-black-goldstruck-8-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Saucony Endorphin Pro 3 is a real game-changer for dedicated runners. It's not just about the flashy design or the cool tech they've crammed into these shoes, but the real difference is how it makes you feel while you're pounding the pavement. 

First off, the carbon-fiber plate gives you a real push. It's like someone's giving you a little nudge every time you take a step. It's especially noticeable on those long, hard runs when you're pushing yourself to the limit. The SPEEDROLL technology coupled with the carbon-fiber plate makes it feel like you're running on air. 

But what about cushioning? Well, Saucony didn't skimp on that either. The PWRRUN PB foam gives you a soft, yet supportive landing. It's like running on clouds, but with a solid base beneath you. The extra 4mm of cushioning compared to its predecessor really makes a difference. 

One thing I noticed right away was the fit. Saucony's FORMFIT design hugs every inch of your foot, providing a personalized fit that's both comfortable and secure. The lightweight upper also allows for some breathability, which is always a plus when you're running hard. 

That said, there are a couple of things that could be improved. The XT-900 outsole is great for grip, but it could be better in wet conditions. And while the wider toe box in the Pro 2 version was a welcome change, the Pro 3 version seems to have gone back to a narrower design. 

Overall, the Saucony Endorphin Pro 3 is a fantastic running shoe with a perfect blend of speed and comfort. It's definitely worth considering if you're looking for a shoe that can keep up with your running ambitions.

In my search for the perfect running shoe this season, I came across the Saucony Endorphin Pro 3. The sleek, white and black design with vizi accents caught my eye, and I was eager to see if it could live up to the hype. 

On the first pairing, the shoe felt amazing. The SPEEDROLL technology combined with the powerful carbon-fibre plate provided effortless speed, and the cushioning felt like I was running on clouds. The details were thoughtfully implemented, and the fit was just right. There was a good balance of comfort and responsiveness, making my runs more enjoyable.

However, as I continued to use the Saucony Endorphin Pro 3, I noticed a few small drawbacks. For starters, the shoe was a little heavier than I initially expected, and the thicker cushioning made it feel a bit slower than some of my other running shoes. I also noticed a slight discomfort in the heel after running for longer periods, which took away from the overall comfort I enjoyed earlier on. 

In conclusion, the Saucony Endorphin Pro 3 is a great choice for anyone who wants a versatile, fast, and comfortable pair of running shoes. While it may not be perfect, the pros definitely outweigh the cons, making it a worthwhile investment for those looking to push their limits on the track or in their fitness journeys.

### What is Saucony Endorphin Pro?

The Saucony Endorphin Pro is a running shoe designed for stability and support. It features a lightweight EVA midsole and a robust carbon plate to provide cushioning, responsiveness, and protection during runs. The shoe utilizes a unique Imeva foam construction that enhances energy return and ensures a comfortable ride. 

Saucony Endorphin Pro is suitable for runners who need additional stability and support due to the natural arch of their feet or overpronation while running. It is perfect for moderate to fast-paced workouts and can be used for long-distance races as well as daily training sessions. In short, it is a versatile running shoe that provides a comfortable and supportive running experience. 


### What is the Imeva foam used in the Saucony Endorphin Pro?

Imeva foam, short for Intelligent Motion Energy Vibration Absorption, is a type of cushioning foam used in the Saucony Endorphin Pro. It combines the benefits of softness and responsiveness in a single material. The unique properties of Imeva foam enable it to absorb impact energy, providing a soft landing for runners, while also returning energy back to the runner for enhanced performance and reduced fatigue. 

The Imeva foam in the Saucony Endorphin Pro is layered between the shoe's upper and outsole. This placement allows for optimal interaction between the foam and the ground, maximizing cushioning and energy return. The result is a running shoe that delivers a smooth and comfortable ride while keeping the runner in motion.

### How does the carbon plate in the Saucony Endorphin Pro work?

The carbon plate in the Saucony Endorphin Pro is a lightweight, rigid component located in the midsole of the shoe. Its primary function is to enhance energy return while optimizing cushioning and stability. When a runner's foot strikes the ground, the carbon plate compresses slightly, absorbing some of the impact force. 

As the runner's foot continues to push off the ground, the carbon plate acts as a springboard, returning some of the absorbed energy to the runner. This energy return helps propel the runner forward more efficiently, reducing fatigue and increasing overall performance. The carbon plate also helps to provide stability and support by preventing excessive foot movement within the shoe. 


### What is the weight of the Saucony Endorphin Pro?

The Saucony Endorphin Pro weighs around 10.4 ounces (296 grams) for a men's size 9 and 8.6 ounces (245 grams) for a women's size 7. The shoe's lightweight construction contributes to its responsiveness and overall comfort, making it an appealing choice for runners seeking a fast and efficient running experience. 

This weight is within the average range for running shoes in the Saucony's price point and category, making the Saucony Endorphin Pro a competitive option when compared to other leading brands in the market. Despite its relatively light weight, the shoe still offers a robust structure to provide the necessary support and stability for even the most demanding runs.

### How does the Saucony Endorphin Pro provide stability?

The Saucony Endorphin Pro provides stability through its combination of an EVA midsole, carbon plate, and sturdy upper construction. The EVA midsole is designed to absorb impact forces and provide a responsive ride, while the carbon plate adds additional support and energy return. Together, these materials enhance the shoe's overall stability and responsiveness, ensuring a smooth and controlled running experience for those who require extra support or suffer from overpronation. 

The upper of the Saucony Endorphin Pro features a secure fit with a supportive heel counter and a reinforced saddle that wraps around the foot. This design provides a snug and comfortable fit, helping to keep the foot in place and prevent excessive foot movement within the shoe. The shoe's overlapping layers and structure also contribute to its stability, providing a stable platform for runners to execute their stride with confidence. 


### What is the durability of the Saucony Endorphin Pro?

The Saucony Endorphin Pro is designed with durability in mind. Its sturdy construction and use of high-quality materials contribute to its long-lasting performance. The EVA midsole and carbon plate are both robust and can withstand the wear and tear of regular running usage. Additionally, the shoe features a reinforced upper with overlapping layers to protect against abrasion and damage. 

Saucony has a reputation for producing running shoes that hold up well over time despite their lightweight designs, and the Endorphin Pro is no exception. Regular maintenance, such as cleaning and moisturizing the shoe's upper after each run, can further extend the durability of the Saucony Endorphin Pro. Overall, this shoe is built to handle the demands of frequent running with minimal wear and tear, making it a reliable option for runners looking for a durable and dependable shoe.
