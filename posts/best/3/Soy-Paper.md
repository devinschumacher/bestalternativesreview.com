During my recent calligraphy practice, I discovered the enchanting potential of the Xuan Paper Drawing Paper. As a writer, I found it remarkable how easily the ink flowed over the surface, revealing the intricate strokes of my brush.

Using the sheets was a breeze - they were conveniently packaged and super easy to handle when working on my art projects. The white color was perfect for creating bold, vibrant images and the paper's thickness was just right for retaining the ink without bleeding through. 

However, one thing I'd like to point out is that the sheets are quite thin and may not be suitable for all types of painting or drawing techniques. For instance, I faced issues with water-based media like acrylics, as the paper would tear easily with too much moisture.

This made me feel confident about using it for my daily food wrapping needs. 

One of my favorite features of this wax paper is that it's freezer safe, making it perfect for wrapping a variety of foods like sandwiches, cheese, meat, fish, and vegetables. I found that it kept my food fresh and flavorful, without any unpleasant odors or tastes. The paper is also quite durable, which was reassuring when I wrapped items that required more sturdiness. 

However, there were a couple of downsides to my experience. Although tearing the wax paper was relatively easy, the perforations were not as clean as I would have liked. This made the edges a bit rough, which could potentially affect the presentation of my food. Additionally, the product's eco-friendly credentials make it quite an appealing choice, but the availability of refills can be a challenge for those who want to continue using the product without constantly buying new boxes. 

Overall, I enjoyed using the Unbleached 100% Soybean Wax Paper from If You Care. It was a versatile and environmentally friendly choice, and I appreciated the clean and natural ingredients. While the product wasn't perfect, its benefits outweighed the minor drawbacks, making it a worthwhile addition to my kitchen.
