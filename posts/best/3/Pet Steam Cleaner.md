### [Bissell ProHeat Pet Advanced Full-Size Carpet Cleaner with Heatwave Technology - Perfect for Pet Stains and Odors [22" L]](https://serp.ly/amazon/Pet+Steam+Cleaner?utm\_term=bissell-proheat-pet-advanced-full-size-carpet-cleaner-with-heatwave-technology-perfect-for-pet-stains-and-odors-22-l)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Pet+Steam+Cleaner?utm_term=bissell-proheat-pet-advanced-full-size-carpet-cleaner-with-heatwave-technology-perfect-for-pet-stains-and-odors-22-l"><img alt="bissell-proheat-pet-advanced-full-size-carpet-cleaner-1800" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bissell-proheat-pet-advanced-full-size-carpet-cleaner-1800/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Bissell Proheat Pet Advanced Full-Size Carpet Cleaner has been an essential tool in my home for removing pet stains and making the carpets pristine once again. The advanced deep cleaning system utilizing six row advanced brush technology has made it incredibly easy to tackle those hard-to-clean spots. 

One feature that really stood out is the hose and tools for upholstery and spot cleaning. It has allowed me to tackle every nook and cranny of my house with the most thorough cleaning I've ever experienced. However, as much as I love this machine, it has its struggles too. The water reservoir, although useful, can be a bit of a hassle to empty without spilling the clean water, especially when trying to clean up a large area. 

Another issue I've experienced is the power switch's odd placement on the back of the handle. Somewhat of a minor inconvenience, but I would have preferred a foot switch for a more natural operation. Overall, the Bissell Proheat Pet Advanced Full-Size Carpet Cleaner has been a game-changer in the world of pet carpet cleaning. 


### [Portable Carpet Cleaner: Bissell Pet Stain Cordless Eraser (3180)](https://serp.ly/amazon/Pet+Steam+Cleaner?utm\_term=portable-carpet-cleaner-bissell-pet-stain-cordless-eraser-3180)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Pet+Steam+Cleaner?utm_term=portable-carpet-cleaner-bissell-pet-stain-cordless-eraser-3180"><img alt="bissell-pet-stain-eraser-cordless-portable-carpet-cleaner-3181" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bissell-pet-stain-eraser-cordless-portable-carpet-cleaner-3181/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a pet owner, I've been there - dealing with those unexpected pet messes. And if you're anything like me, you know that quick, easy cleanup is the key to maintaining your sanity. That's where Bissell's Pet Stain Eraser comes in handy. This little powerhouse is the perfect tool to tackle those inevitable messes in a snap. 

The first thing that struck me was how lightweight it was - even with its built-in battery, it barely felt like I was carrying anything. With a 3.3-pound design, it's a breeze to maneuver around the house, and the 7.2V lithium-ion battery makes it easy to grab and go whenever needed. 

But what really sets this portable carpet cleaner apart is its ability to remove tough pet stains. The OXY formula included in the package, which stores right in the machine, works wonders on pesky stains, lifting them up and leaving your carpets looking as good as new. No need to worry about mixing water and cleaner here. The fact that no water is required also makes cleanup a breeze - just empty the tank when it's full. 

Of course, no product is without its cons, and the Pet Stain Eraser was no exception. The suction may not be as powerful as some full-sized carpet cleaners, but for the size of the cleaner, it gets the job done. The small tank size does mean you'll need to empty and refill it frequently, but again, for a small device, it's a manageable drawback. 

In terms of craftsmanship, the Bissell Pet Stain Eraser is a solid choice. It's easy to assemble and takes minimal effort to store away when not in use. One downside is its noise level, which can be a bit louder than expected, but given the small size of the cleaner, it's not too surprising. 

Overall, the Bissell Pet Stain Eraser is a handy tool for pet owners looking for a quick, easy-to-use solution to those inevitable pet messes. Its lightweight design, powerful stain-removing capabilities, and convenient no-water formula make it a worthwhile addition to any pet owner's arsenal, even if it isn't perfect. 


### [Bissell Pet Stain Eraser Plus - Pet Steam Cleaner](https://serp.ly/amazon/Pet+Steam+Cleaner?utm\_term=bissell-pet-stain-eraser-plus-pet-steam-cleaner)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Pet+Steam+Cleaner?utm_term=bissell-pet-stain-eraser-plus-pet-steam-cleaner"><img alt="bissell-pet-stain-eraser-plus-3181black-blue-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bissell-pet-stain-eraser-plus-3181black-blue-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

This little wonder has been a game-changer in my life as a pet owner and a busy mom. The Bissell Pet Stain Eraser Plus has made cleaning up those pesky pet messes a breeze, without having to lug around a cumbersome machine. 

I absolutely love the cordless convenience of this cleaner. Its lithium-ion battery is always ready to tackle any mess, anywhere and anytime. And the fact that I can store the formula in the machine when it's not in use, eliminates the hassle of mixing the solution every time I need to use it. No water, no mess! 

I also appreciate the lightweight design. Weighing just 3.3 pounds, it's easy to maneuver around the house, even in hard-to-reach areas. And let's not forget that every purchase helps save pets. Bissell is taking steps to help homeless pets, making this purchase not just practical but also ethical. 

However, I have noticed that the battery life could be better. It runs out quickly especially when dealing with stubborn stains. And it's not the most powerful cleaner on the market. But considering its portability and ease of use, it's a small sacrifice to make. 

Overall, the Bissell Pet Stain Eraser Plus has become an essential part of my household cleaning routine. It's efficient, convenient, and most importantly, it gets the job done! 


### [Bissell PowerBrush Pet XL Carpet Cleaner for Pets](https://serp.ly/amazon/Pet+Steam+Cleaner?utm\_term=bissell-powerbrush-pet-xl-carpet-cleaner-for-pets)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Pet+Steam+Cleaner?utm_term=bissell-powerbrush-pet-xl-carpet-cleaner-for-pets"><img alt="bissell-powerforce-powerbrush-pet-xl-carpet-cleaner-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bissell-powerforce-powerbrush-pet-xl-carpet-cleaner-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I was given the opportunity to test the Bissell PowerForce PowerBrush Pet XL Carpet Cleaner for cleaning up pet messes, and it completely transformed my experience! As a pet owner, I understand the annoyance of dealing with your pets' incidents - particularly those challenging spots such as upholstery and stairs. The PowerBrush was created with these areas in mind, equipped with a four-row DeepReach PowerBrush capable of reaching and dealing with those pesky pet stains, effectively removing embedded dirt and allergens.

One of the features that immediately caught my attention is the lightweight and maneuverable design. Weighing significantly less than 17 lbs, I found it incredibly easy to transport it throughout my home while doing heavy-duty cleaning tasks. The Tough Stain Tool that came along with the 8-foot hose proved to be invaluable in my deep-cleaning efforts across my house.

But that’s not all! In addition to its remarkable performance, the PowerBrush also plays an essential role in supporting animals in need. BISSELL takes great pride in its affiliation with BISSELL Pet Foundation, an organization dedicated to finding forever homes for pets in need. The knowledge that my purchase contributes towards this cause has only enhanced my sense of satisfaction with this purchase.

However, a couple of minor cons should be noted. The dirty water tank tends to fill up rather quickly, but I’ve found a solution by using a cleaning bucket to empty the reservoir into. A potential drawback that may need further consideration is the hose length. Although 8 feet is decent, it may need to be extended for specific tasks to achieve the desired coverage.

In conclusion, the Bissell PowerForce PowerBrush Pet XL Carpet Cleaner has become an indispensable tool in my cleaning routine. As pet owners look for a powerful and efficient way to tackle pet messes while contributing to the welfare of animals, I wholeheartedly recommend the PowerBrush.


### [Bissell TurboClean DualPro Pet Carpet Shampoo](https://serp.ly/amazon/Pet+Steam+Cleaner?utm\_term=bissell-turboclean-dualpro-pet-carpet-shampoo)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Pet+Steam+Cleaner?utm_term=bissell-turboclean-dualpro-pet-carpet-shampoo"><img alt="bissell-turboclean-dualpro-pet-carpet-cleaner-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bissell-turboclean-dualpro-pet-carpet-cleaner-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The four-row DeepReach PowerBrush is effective in its cleaning, and the Express Clean Mode ensures that your carpet dries in a reasonable 45 minutes. 

However, some users may find the water tank capacity and the cleanup process to be a bit of a hassle, as it requires frequent emptying. On the positive side, the price is competitive, and the powerful suction system outperforms competitors for unbeatable cleaning. 


### [McCulloch MC1385 Deluxe Canister Floor Steamer](https://serp.ly/amazon/Pet+Steam+Cleaner?utm\_term=mcculloch-mc1385-deluxe-canister-floor-steamer)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Pet+Steam+Cleaner?utm_term=mcculloch-mc1385-deluxe-canister-floor-steamer"><img alt="mcculloch-mc1385-deluxe-canister-steam-cleaner-system-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mcculloch-mc1385-deluxe-canister-steam-cleaner-system-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who's had their fair share of experiences with various cleaning products, the McCulloch MC1385 Deluxe Canister Steam Cleaner System truly stands out from the rest. My latest cleaning escapade involved using this system to steam and scrub my recently renovated master bathroom, and let me tell you, it was a game-changer. 

One of the first things that caught my attention was the built-in steam hose and power cord combo, which not only made it incredibly convenient but also allowed me to reach the tiniest of spots. It was like having a mini cleaning superhero at my side as I tackled grime and dirt that had been lurking in my bathroom for far too long. 

However, as much as I loved the steam hose and cord length, the weight of the system was quite surprising. In my past cleaning endeavors, a lighter cleaning device always worked best for me. But, with the MC1385 in tow, I found myself having to exercise a bit more upper body strength to get the job done. 

Despite the added workout, I was able to customize the steam output to my liking, thanks to the variable steam settings. This allowed me to be more efficient in my cleaning missions, as I didn't have to crank the steam all the way up when I was dealing with delicate surfaces. 

While the powerful steam action made short work of removing dirt and grime, it also left me with a few concerns about the product's long-term viability. The machine seemed to require extra care to properly maintain, and I was left wondering if the constant use would eventually wear it down. 

In conclusion, the McCulloch MC1385 Deluxe Canister Steam System is an impressive piece of cleaning machinery that tackles even the toughest jobs with ease. From its super-versatile attachments to its powerful steam, it's clear that this system has the grime-removal capabilities to make even the most stubborn grime disappear. Just remember to give it a proper once-over after each use to ensure it stays in top shape for your next cleaning adventure. 


### [Bissell Proheat Pet Turbo Carpet Cleaner with Advanced Pet Stain Removal](https://serp.ly/amazon/Pet+Steam+Cleaner?utm\_term=bissell-proheat-pet-turbo-carpet-cleaner-with-advanced-pet-stain-removal)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Pet+Steam+Cleaner?utm_term=bissell-proheat-pet-turbo-carpet-cleaner-with-advanced-pet-stain-removal"><img alt="bissell-1799v-proheat-pet-turbo-carpet-cleaner-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bissell-1799v-proheat-pet-turbo-carpet-cleaner-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've had the chance to try out the Bissell Proheat Pet Turbo Carpet Cleaner a few times, and I must say I was pretty impressed with its overall performance. One of the things that really popped out to me was the powerful suction it offers. Whether it was tackling deep-seated stains or just freshening up the carpet, its vacuuming abilities were quite impressive. 

One feature that I found particularly helpful was the SmartMix technology. It made it really easy to adjust the cleaning formula to better suit the specific needs of the room I was working in, ensuring that the cleaner was doing the best possible job. 

However, the product was not without its drawbacks. For one, I found the handle to be quite cumbersome and difficult to maneuver around, especially in smaller and more complicated areas. And let's not forget about the weight - it's really quite an effort to haul this thing around for any length of time. 

On top of that, I wasn't a huge fan of how it handled the dirty water tank. Getting rid of all the dirty water proved to be a bit of a challenge, which was something I wasn't too thrilled about. 

In conclusion, the Bissell Proheat Pet Turbo Carpet Cleaner has its good qualities and its bad ones. While it was pretty effective at what it was designed to do, I couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed by its heavy weight and the somewhat awkward design of its dirty water tank. It's definitely not perfect, but if you're willing to put in a little extra effort, it should do a decent job of cleaning your carpets.
