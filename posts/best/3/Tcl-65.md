### [TCL 65" 4K UHD HDR Roku Smart TV: Experience High-Quality Entertainment](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Tcl+65?utm\_term=tcl-65-4k-uhd-hdr-roku-smart-tv-experience-high-quality-entertainment)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Tcl+65?utm_term=tcl-65-4k-uhd-hdr-roku-smart-tv-experience-high-quality-entertainment"><img alt="tcl-65s425-65-class-4-series-4k-uhd-hdr-roku-smart-tv-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tcl-65s425-65-class-4-series-4k-uhd-hdr-roku-smart-tv-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently experienced the TCL 65" 4K UHD HDR Roku Smart TV myself and have to say, the picture quality is quite impressive, offering sharp detail and lifelike colors. However, the Roku smart platform seems to have a bit more to offer entertainment-wise, with endless streaming options making it a versatile choice for all types of content. 

One downside I noticed is the audio quality, as the two 8W speakers sometimes struggle to deliver a satisfying sound performance. Additionally, I had some issues with the smart TV's performance, including freezing and occasional unexplainable behavior. 

Overall, the TCL 65" smart TV offers a great balance of quality and affordability, but it's essential to consider the pros and cons before making a purchase and to potentially do further research on any potential issues users might face in the long run. 


### [Best 65" 4K Smart TV from Sony for WiFi Streaming](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Tcl+65?utm\_term=best-65-4k-smart-tv-from-sony-for-wifi-streaming)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Tcl+65?utm_term=best-65-4k-smart-tv-from-sony-for-wifi-streaming"><img alt="smart-tv-sony-kd65x85k-65-4k-ultra-hd-led-wifi-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/smart-tv-sony-kd65x85k-65-4k-ultra-hd-led-wifi-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Sony KD65X85K is a fantastic Smart TV boasting an impressive 4K Ultra HD resolution, a rich array of color options, and an innovative 120Hz refresh rate for smoother motion and transitions. The Triluminos Pro and 4K HDR Processor X1 bring over a billion colors to life, making content look lifelike and vibrant. The 4K HDR Processor X1 also optimizes low-quality images by upscaling them to 4K resolution, providing crystal-clear visuals even for non-4K content. 

The Sony Bravia delivers superior sound quality as well, with the X-Balanced Speaker providing clear, immersive audio for movies, music, and more. Additionally, the smart features, such as Google TV, built-in voice control, and the customizable Bravia Cam, add to the overall user experience, making this TV an excellent choice for a home cinema system. 

While the Sony KD65X85K offers top-notch performance in picture and sound quality, it might not be perfect for everyone, as some users reported issues with stand stability, screen blurriness, or occasional display flickering. However, these cons do not outweigh the pros for many users, making this the ideal 4K smart TV for those who appreciate excellent image and audio quality, a wide range of features, and seamless smart functionality. 


### [Sony X90L 4K UHD HDR LED Smart TV - 65 Inch 2023 Model](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Tcl+65?utm\_term=sony-x90l-4k-uhd-hdr-led-smart-tv-65-inch-2023-model)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Tcl+65?utm_term=sony-x90l-4k-uhd-hdr-led-smart-tv-65-inch-2023-model"><img alt="sony-xr65x90lu-65-inch-x90l-4k-uhd-hdr-full-array-led-google-smart-bravia-tv-2024" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sony-xr65x90lu-65-inch-x90l-4k-uhd-hdr-full-array-led-google-smart-bravia-tv-2024/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Meet the Sony BRAVIA X90L, a television that's anything but ordinary. As someone who's always on the lookout for the latest and greatest technology, this 65-inch UHD TV caught my eye instantly. The breathtaking 4K resolution and Full Array LED backlight technology have made watching my favorite shows and films an even more immersive experience. 

One of the things that really stood out to me is the XR Triluminos Pro feature, which pushes the boundaries of what's possible with color accuracy. Picture quality is sharper, more vibrant, and more lifelike than ever before. It's not just about the visuals - the Acoustic Multi-Audio technology has made for a remarkably immersive audio experience, thanks to the strategically placed sound positioning tweeters. 

I also appreciated the flexibility of the TV's multi-position stand, which can be adjusted to suit your specific viewing needs. The slim and minimalist design adds a touch of elegance to any room, and, as a gamer, the HDMI 2.1 ports really came in handy, allowing for high refresh rates and smoother gameplay. 

However, no product is without its drawbacks. The Google TV smart platform, while user-friendly, does have its quirks and occasional lags in navigation. Additionally, some users may not appreciate the relatively high price point compared to other 4K UHD televisions on the market. 

With its stunning visuals, powerful audio, and smart features, the Sony BRAVIA X90L has quickly become the centerpiece of my home entertainment setup. Despite its minor issues, I highly recommend it to anyone looking to elevate their TV viewing experience to new heights.

Embarking on a quest to enhance my daily entertainment routine, I stumbled upon the illustrious TCL 65" Class 5-Series 4K UHD QLED Dolby Vision & Atmos, VRR, AMD FreeSync, Smart Roku TV. As an avid film enthusiast, I eagerly sought to discover if this TV would be worthy of joining my home theater lineup. 

From the moment I unboxed this beauty, I was impressed by its sleek and modern design. The 65-inch screen certainly makes a statement in any living space. The setup process was seamless, thanks to TCL's user-friendly interface. I was delighted to find that the remote had fewer buttons than typical TV remotes, making it more intuitive and less overwhelming. 

The real gem of this device is its stunning visual performance. The QLED technology combined with the HDR Pro Pack and Dolby Vision HDR delivers a lifelike picture that I hadn't experienced before. The contrast control zones and dynamic color enhancement truly bring out the nuances of every scene, whether it's a high-energy action film or a heartwarming documentary. 

However, the 65S555 did present a few challenges in my user experience. Occasionally, I encountered difficulty with the built-in audio system. While it delivered decent sound during everyday usage, I found myself longing for a more immersive audio experience. Thankfully, I was able to connect my external soundbar seamlessly, resolving the issue. 

One peculiar issue I faced was the occasional black screen problem. The TV seemed to function perfectly for a period, but then would abruptly cut to a black screen and refuse to turn back on. This, unfortunately, marred the otherwise smooth and seamless experience provided by the TV. A quick reset would typically resolve the issue, but it was frustrating to encounter so often. 

Despite these hiccups, I am overall thrilled with the TCL 65" Class 5-Series 4K UHD QLED Dolby Vision & Atmos, VRR, AMD FreeSync, Smart Roku TV. Its superior picture quality, user-friendly interface, and the plethora of streaming options on Roku make it an exceptional home theater companion. I look forward to enjoying many more memorable moments with this exceptional TV.
