### How should I clean my Titleist putter?

Cleaning your Titleist putter is essential to maintaining its appearance and performance. First, remove any debris or grass from the putter using a soft-bristled brush or a towel. Then, use a putter cleaning solution designed for golf clubs to remove any dirt, grime, or stains. Be sure to follow the cleaning solution's instructions to avoid damaging the finish. 

Once the putter is clean, dry it thoroughly with a soft cloth. It's also a good idea to apply a protective coating to the putter's surface to prevent oxidation and maintain its appearance over time. Regular cleaning and maintenance will help ensure your Titleist putter remains in top condition for years to come. 


### What is the warranty on Titleist putters?

Titleist offers a limited lifetime warranty on all of their putters, excluding custom and painted putters.

### How do I know the right length of Titleist putter for my height?

The ideal length of a Titleist putter is subjective and can vary from player to player. However, there are some general guidelines to consider when choosing the right length for your height and stroke. In general, taller players may prefer a slightly longer putter, while shorter players may prefer a slightly shorter putter. 

Additionally, it's essential to consider the length of your arms and the distance between your hands and the floor when addressing the ball. Most golfers will find a putter length that falls between 32 and 36 inches to be comfortable and suitable for their playing style. Ultimately, it's best to try several putters of different lengths to find the one that feels most comfortable and helps you make the most accurate strokes. 


### How do I determine the loft of my Titleist putter?

To determine the loft of your Titleist putter, you can refer to the manufacturer's specifications or consult the product information provided with your purchase. The loft is typically listed as a degree measurement and indicates the angle of the face at its highest point. For putters, the loft range can vary depending on the model, but most putters have a loft of between 2 and 4 degrees. 

It's essential to note that the loft of your putter can impact the distance and trajectory of your strokes. Generally, putters with a higher loft will produce a higher trajectory, while those with a lower loft will produce a lower trajectory. When choosing a putter, it's crucial to consider your stroke type and the type of greens you typically play on to determine the ideal loft range for your game.
