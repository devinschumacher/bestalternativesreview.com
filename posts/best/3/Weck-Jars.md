### Materials and Construction

The material and construction of Weck Jars play a significant role in their durability and functionality.

### What is the difference between wide mouth and narrow mouth Weck Jars?

They are also ideal for making jams, pickles, and other recipes that require more ingredients or larger pieces of produce to be added. However, they may not work well with some pressure-cooking methods, as their larger opening can make it challenging to maintain the required pressure levels.

They are perfect for making chutneys, jams, or pickles where smaller pieces of fruit or vegetables need to be added. However, they might be slightly more difficult to fill and clean due to their smaller opening. When choosing between wide mouth and narrow mouth jars, consider the specific recipe requirements and your personal preferences for ease of use.

Additionally, Weck Jars offer a reliable and consistent seal that holds pressure and maintains food freshness for extended periods. 

However, it is essential to follow the recommended canning guidelines and recipes specific to Weck Jars, as proper sterilization and processing steps are crucial for maintaining food safety and quality. Following the manufacturer's instructions and guidelines will ensure that your Weck Jars provide a safe and secure container for your preserved food. 


### What is the warranty on Weck Jars?
