One of the aspects I love the most about this wreath hanger is its classic, shiny white metallic design. It adds a touch of elegance and sophistication to any door it's attached to, making it a perfect addition to your home decor. Plus, the fact that it comes fully assembled and ready for display is a major plus - no need to fumble around trying to put it together yourself! 

However, there is one downside to this hanger that I've noticed. Due to its sturdiness, it can sometimes obstruct the door from closing all the way - especially if your door has a glass panel. To remedy this issue, I simply added a small rubber furniture pad to the bottom of the hanger, and it worked like a charm! 

Overall, I would highly recommend the Sullivans Wreath Hanger to anyone in need of a sturdy and stylish way to hang their wreaths. Whether it's for a holiday, a special occasion, or just to add some charm to your home, this hanger is the perfect solution.
