Plus, the fact that it comes fully assembled and ready for display is a major plus - no need to fumble around trying to put it together yourself!

To remedy this issue, I simply added a small rubber furniture pad to the bottom of the hanger, and it worked like a charm! 

Overall, I would highly recommend the Sullivans Wreath Hanger to anyone in need of a sturdy and stylish way to hang their wreaths. Whether it's for a holiday, a special occasion, or just to add some charm to your home, this hanger is the perfect solution.
