### [Reebok Men's Royal BB4500 Sneaker - Cushion, Comfort, and Versatility](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Rbx+Shoes?utm\_term=reebok-mens-royal-bb4500-sneaker-cushion-comfort-and-versatility)

As a reviewer who tried the Reebok Men's Royal BB4500 HI2 Sneaker, I must say that my experience with these shoes was surprisingly satisfying. Upon opening the box, the high-top design immediately caught my eye – it transported me back to the days of playing basketball in my gym class. 

One of the most notable features was the removable EVA sockliner, which provided a nice cushion for my feet. It accommodated my orthotics without any issues, making these shoes an excellent choice for individuals who require additional support. The blended leather and mesh upper offered both comfort and style, making them suitable for various occasions. 

However, there were a couple of drawbacks I encountered during my experience. Firstly, the shoe's heel felt rather high, which may not be ideal for everyone. Additionally, the sizing seemed slightly off, as they required a half-size adjustment to achieve a comfortable fit. But overall, these shoes performed admirably in both comfort and style, making them a solid addition to my wardrobe. 

In summary, the Reebok Men's Royal BB4500 HI2 Sneaker provided a nice blend of heritage craftsmanship and modern comfort.

### [Reebok DMX Comfort Plus Men's Walking Shoe - Black 11](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Rbx+Shoes?utm\_term=reebok-dmx-comfort-plus-mens-walking-shoe-black-11)

Experience the ultimate comfort in your daily walk with the Reebok DMX Comfort+ Walking Shoe. I've been using these shoes for a few weeks now, and they've become an essential part of my morning routine.

It's a nice relief after long hours of standing or walking, especially for those of us who suffer from plantar fasciitis. The EVA midsole also adds to the overall comfort, making it feel like I'm walking on a cloud. 

However, there were a couple of minor drawbacks. The lace closure can be a bit tricky to maneuver around the elastic band, but it's nothing a little patience can't fix. Also, the tongue might be a bit too high for some, but that's a preference issue rather than a flaw in the shoe's design. 

Overall, the Reebok DMX Comfort+ Walking Shoe exceeded my expectations in terms of comfort and support. I've felt a significant difference in the way I walk and my overall foot health.
