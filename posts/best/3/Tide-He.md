### [Tide HE Turbo Clean: 10x More Cleaning Power for Stain Removal](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Tide+He?utm\_term=tide-he-turbo-clean-10x-more-cleaning-power-for-stain-removal)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Tide+He?utm_term=tide-he-turbo-clean-10x-more-cleaning-power-for-stain-removal"><img alt="tide-he-turbo-clean-liquid-laundry-detergent-original-scent-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tide-he-turbo-clean-liquid-laundry-detergent-original-scent-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using Tide's HE Turbo Clean liquid laundry detergent for a while now, and I must say, it's impressive. This detergent really does seem to have 10 times the cleaning power of your average laundry soap. The Smart Suds technology is quite cool, too – the quick-collapsing suds in this high-efficiency detergent help your clothes clean faster and rinse out with no hassle, even in cold cycles. 

One of the things I really appreciate about this product is the Original Scent. I've never been a huge fan of overwhelming odors in my laundry, so this mild, refreshing fragrance has been quite pleasant. Another highlight has been the way it maintains the color of my clothes – they've stayed vibrant and true-to-color wash after wash. 

That said, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. I did notice that if I didn't measure it out correctly, it could sometimes leave a bit of residue on my whites, which, depending on how particular I'm feeling, can be a little annoying. But overall, this Tide HE Turbo Clean liquid laundry detergent has made my laundry routine more efficient and effective. I highly recommend giving it a try!

One of my favorite things about this product is that it tackles even the toughest stains with ease. Just one wash left my clothes looking and smelling amazing, no pre-treating or scrubbing needed. The odor-eliminating technology also ensures that my clothes stay smelling great between washes, even in cold water.

The washing machine's performance improves significantly with this feature, making the laundry experience much easier and efficient. Additionally, this Tide product maintains the vibrancy of my whites and the brilliance of my colors, ensuring that my clothes always look wash after wash. 

The Clean Breeze Scent of this Tide laundry detergent is incredibly refreshing and reminds me of fresh, line-dried laundry on a warm spring day. The scent lingers on my clothes long after the wash, providing an added touch of freshness in my everyday wardrobe.

### [Tide Ultra Oxi Liquid Laundry Detergent: Concentrated Stain Removal and Freshness](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Tide+He?utm\_term=tide-ultra-oxi-liquid-laundry-detergent-concentrated-stain-removal-and-freshness)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Tide+He?utm_term=tide-ultra-oxi-liquid-laundry-detergent-concentrated-stain-removal-and-freshness"><img alt="tide-detergent-ultra-oxi-4-55-l-1-2-gal-154-fl-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tide-detergent-ultra-oxi-4-55-l-1-2-gal-154-fl-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using Tide Ultra Oxi for a while now, and it has been a game-changer in my laundry routine. The built-in pre-treaters really help tackle even the stubborn stains, making my laundry experience a breeze. However, the smell is strong, and it almost reminds me of dish soap. I can't help but feel like it overpowers my laundry room, even with the door closed. 

One thing I truly appreciate is the concentrated formula; I don't feel like I'm wasting water. It's easy to measure the right amount for each load, and the product really gets the job done. The small but powerful Tide PODS laundry pacs are also an excellent option for those looking for a mess-free alternative. 

While the strong scent may be a downside for some, the overall performance and convenience of this product make it a worthy addition to any laundry room. However, I'll be on the lookout for an alternative detergent with a slightly less overpowering smell. 


### [Tide Eco-Box He Laundry Detergent](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Tide+He?utm\_term=tide-eco-box-he-laundry-detergent)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Tide+He?utm_term=tide-eco-box-he-laundry-detergent"><img alt="tide-eco-box-he-liquid-laundry-detergent-tide-original-scent-105oz-89013-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tide-eco-box-he-liquid-laundry-detergent-tide-original-scent-105oz-89013-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Tried and tested the Eco-Box He liquid laundry detergent by Tide one day, and I must say, it was a game-changer for me. This convenient laundry detergent has everything that a modern home needs to keep our clothes clean and smelling fresh. 

The key feature that stood out to me was the concentrated formula of the Tide Eco-Box He. As someone who loves to be eco-friendly, I appreciated that it's less water-intensive and requires fewer plastic components than traditional, bulky detergent bottles. Plus, the Eco-Box he's reusable, and the twist-off dispenser makes it super easy to use. 

On the downside, the detergent doesn't come with clear installation instructions for the stand that's essential for maintaining a clean and tidy storage space. It took some trial and error before I was able to figure it out. 

Additionally, I couldn't help but notice that the instructions for using the Eco-Box he seemed a bit confusing, especially when it came to the no-drip tap. A little more precise language in the instructions would have made all the difference. 

All things considered, the Tide Eco-Box He is a top-notch laundry detergent. With its concentrated formula, environmental-friendly nature, and hassle-free use, it's an excellent choice for those who want to keep their clothes (and the environment) clean and fresh. A well-deserved 4.5 out of 5 stars! 


### [Tide High Efficiency Liquid Laundry Detergent](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Tide+He?utm\_term=tide-high-efficiency-liquid-laundry-detergent)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Tide+He?utm_term=tide-high-efficiency-liquid-laundry-detergent"><img alt="tide-high-efficiency-liquid-laundry-detergent-original-46-fl-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tide-high-efficiency-liquid-laundry-detergent-original-46-fl-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently gave Tide High Efficiency Liquid Laundry Detergent a try and I must say, it has been a game-changer in my laundry routine. The concentrated formula really does make a difference, providing a deep clean without the need for excessive amounts of detergent. 

One of the things that stood out to me is the turbo clean technology, which really seems to get rid of even the toughest stains. However, I have noticed that the consistency of the detergent sometimes changes, making it difficult to measure the correct amount for each load. 

Another positive aspect is the use of post-consumer recycled plastic for the bottle and the 100% renewable wind power electricity used to create the formula. It's great to know that the product I'm using is making a positive impact on the environment. 

Overall, I highly recommend giving Tide High Efficiency Liquid Laundry Detergent a try if you're looking for a reliable and eco-friendly laundry detergent. 


### [Tide Clean Breeze Liquid Detergent - 146 fl oz](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Tide+He?utm\_term=tide-clean-breeze-liquid-detergent-146-fl-oz)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Tide+He?utm_term=tide-clean-breeze-liquid-detergent-146-fl-oz"><img alt="tide-clean-breeze-liquid-laundry-detergent-146-fl-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tide-clean-breeze-liquid-laundry-detergent-146-fl-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a user, I've always been partial to Tide laundry detergent for its consistent results in getting my clothes clean and smelling fresh. However, when I tried Tide Clean Breeze, I was greeted with a new scent that had me second-guessing my loyalty. The formula change seemed to have made the detergent a bit too perfumed for my liking, but it did leave my clothes smelling fresh for a decent amount of time. 

One of the features that stood out to me during my experience with Tide Clean Breeze was its ability to tackle tough stains with ease. The laundry detergent effectively removed dirt and sweat from my family's clothes, leaving them looking and feeling clean. I also noticed that it left a pleasant scent that lingered for a week or so, making me feel like I had just run my clothes through the wash. 

While I appreciated the new scent, I couldn't help but miss the original Tide smell that I had grown accustomed to. The strong smell of the Clean Breeze version felt a bit overwhelming at times, and I found myself longing for the familiar scent that I had come to know and love. 

Overall, Tide Clean Breeze is a capable laundry detergent that does an excellent job of removing stains and leaving clothes smelling fresh. However, the strong scent might not be for everyone, and it's worth considering other Tide scents or even trying the original scent if you're looking to rekindle the familiar smell you've come to know. 


### [Tide Ultra OXI Heavy Duty Laundry Detergent](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Tide+He?utm\_term=tide-ultra-oxi-heavy-duty-laundry-detergent)

Have you ever wondered how your clothes could smell as fresh as you feel after a long day of work? Then Tide Ultra OXI Heavy Duty Original He is the perfect laundry detergent for you. I gave it a try recently, and let me tell you: it lived up to its name. The detergent left my clothes smelling incredibly clean and fresh, despite the tough dirt and grime it tackled. With 3X more stain-removal power, I didn't even feel the need to pre-treat my stained clothes or scrub away. 

Now, let's talk about the scent. Some might argue that it's a bit overpowering, but I personally enjoyed the clean and fresh aroma. And, the best part? It works great in all washing machines and water conditions, even cold water. I highly recommend Tide Ultra OXI Heavy Duty Original He for anyone who wants to enjoy professionally clean clothes with just a small price tag. 


### [Tide + Heavy Duty Detergent for Hygienic Cleaning](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Tide+He?utm\_term=tide-heavy-duty-detergent-for-hygienic-cleaning)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Tide+He?utm_term=tide-heavy-duty-detergent-for-hygienic-cleaning"><img alt="tide-detergent-10x-heavy-duty-hygienic-clean-original-scent-4-87-l-1-28-us-gal-165-fl-oz-liq-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tide-detergent-10x-heavy-duty-hygienic-clean-original-scent-4-87-l-1-28-us-gal-165-fl-oz-liq-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Tide + Hygienic Clean Heavy 10x Duty liquid laundry detergent has become my go-to for tackling the dirt and grime that often sneaks up on your clothes, leaving them looking and smelling their best. Whether it's visible stains like food or mud or the hidden dirt that sometimes lingers despite its invisibility, this detergent leaves no stone unturned. Its innovative liquid technology allows it to penetrate deep into the fibers of your garments, ensuring that every last particle of dirt, sweat, and grime is eradicated with a deep, hygienic clean. 

One of the standout features is its compatibility with all machines and water conditions. I've used it in both high-efficiency and traditional machines, and it always delivers exceptional results. Additionally, its 165 fl oz size makes it perfect for those large loads of laundry, keeping your home's laundry room stocked and ready for action. 

However, I must admit that the Original scent, although not overbearing, is not for everyone. Some reviewers have reported skin irritation or allergies to the product, which is a legitimate concern. As with any new detergent in the household, it's always wise to conduct a test patch or consult a dermatologist if you have concerns about potential allergies or reactions. 

In conclusion, the Tide + Hygienic Clean Heavy 10x Duty liquid laundry detergent lives up to its promises, providing a deep, hygienic clean for all of your laundry needs. The added convenience of its versatile size and compatibility with different machines and water conditions make it a reliable and efficient choice.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Tide+He?utm_term=sensitive-skin-friendly-he-tide-laundry-detergent-pods"><img alt="tide-pods-he-laundry-detergent-pods-free-gentle-152-count-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tide-pods-he-laundry-detergent-pods-free-gentle-152-count-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The convenient, mess-free design of Tide PODS Free & Gentle is another plus. Simply place a pac in the drum with your clothes before starting a wash cycle, and you're good to go. The pod's formulation is designed to work with both high and low-temperature water, providing reliable laundry results whatever your wash cycle temperature. 

However, this product isn't without its drawbacks. Some users have reported issues with plastic residue remaining on their laundry after using the pods, which may require additional cleaning steps. Furthermore, the safety zipper on the product packaging can make it difficult for some users to open, potentially causing inconvenience. 

Overall, Tide PODS Free & Gentle HE Turbo is a good choice for those looking for a gentle, dye-free and perfume-free laundry detergent.

### [Tide Original Liquid Laundry Detergent, 146 fl oz](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Tide+He?utm\_term=tide-original-liquid-laundry-detergent-146-fl-oz)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Tide+He?utm_term=tide-original-liquid-laundry-detergent-146-fl-oz"><img alt="tide-liquid-laundry-detergent-original-146-fl-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tide-liquid-laundry-detergent-original-146-fl-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using Tide Original Liquid Laundry Detergent for a while now, and it's been quite an experience. This super-concentrated detergent is perfect for fighting tough stains and leaving your clothes smelling fresh and clean. 

One thing that immediately caught my attention is the way the Tide detergent handles cold water cycles. I usually try to avoid washing in cold water as it can sometimes make the water and detergent mix poorly, leading to less effective cleaning. However, with Tide, I've noticed that the HE Turbo Clean formula really works, even in cold water. 

Another aspect I've found particularly useful is the smart suds technology. The quick-collapsing suds ensure an efficient and fast cleaning process, making it possible to skip the soaking process before washing, which saves me a lot of time. 

The only downside I've found with Tide is that it can sometimes be a bit tricky to pour out the exact amount of detergent needed, especially when the bottle is almost empty. This could lead to a minor mess in the laundry room. But overall, I'd say Tide Original Liquid Laundry Detergent is a reliable and effective choice for anyone looking for a powerful, effortless, and hassle-free laundry cleaning solution. 


### [Tide Original 3.4L Heavy Duty Detergent](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Tide+He?utm\_term=tide-original-3-4l-heavy-duty-detergent)

Tide laundry detergent is a reliable choice for those seeking a balance of cost-effectiveness and cleaning performance. The original formula has been a dependable companion for many laundry enthusiasts, with its signature scent striking a balance between being fresh and not overpowering. 

One major positive about Tide Original is its ability to handle everyday stains and odors without breaking the bank. Whites stay crisp, and colors remain vibrant, making it a versatile option for any laundry needs. 

However, Tide Original does lack the bells and whistles of other Tide variants, potentially making it less appealing to those who enjoy more advanced features. Additionally, the fragrance may not be ideal for those with sensitive skin, but this is a minor drawback compared to the overall effectiveness of the detergent. 

In summary, Tide Original is a workhorse of detergents – reliable, straightforward, and unpretentious. If you're looking for a no-nonsense solution to your laundry needs, grab the iconic orange bottle and let it work its magic on your laundry mountain.

One of the highlights for me is the fact that this liquid detergent is specifically formulated for high-efficiency (HE) washers, making laundry day a breeze. Its extra-large size means that a single bottle lasts for multiple washes, which is definitely something I appreciate. Additionally, I was pleasantly surprised at how well this detergent works on all colors and textiles, from whites to delicates. 

However, it's essential to note that the concentrated formula does require more liquid per wash compared to others, which can be a drawback if you're used to using a more traditional detergent. Additionally, I noticed that the scent can be quite overpowering, which might not be to everyone's liking. 

In summary, the Tide Ultra Concentrated Liquid Laundry Detergent is an exceptional product that delivers top-notch cleaning and stain removal, but be prepared for the slightly more potent scent and greater liquid requirements for HE washers. Despite these minor downsides, I highly recommend this detergent for its fantastic performance and convenient size.

However, there was a learning curve when it came to the right amount of detergent to use; I found myself using a bit more than usual to get the desired cleanliness.

I recently tried Tide Original HE Turbo Powder Laundry Detergent, and let me tell you - it has cleaned my clothes like a charm! The scent is refreshing and it keeps my whites white and my colors colorful. However, be cautious of the scoop measurement for each load - it's important to follow for the best results. 

The powder does dissolve well as it's designed to, but on a downside, the amount you use can add up quite quickly. Overall, it's a great product, but you should consider the cost of constantly replenishing it. 


### [Tide Free & Gentle Detergent, Ultimate Cleaning Solution](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Tide+He?utm\_term=tide-free-gentle-detergent-ultimate-cleaning-solution)

Not only does it clean my clothes brilliantly, but it also ensures that I don't have to worry about any irritations from dyes or perfumes. And let's face it, who doesn't love saving the environment by using a product that is free of those? 

One thing that stood out to me was the specific measurement scoop, which made it easy to use in different load sizes. The liquid detergent is a little harder for me to handle compared to the traditional powder, but it's a small price to pay for the benefits this product offers. 

However, I did notice a downside. The liquid has been cloudy in a few of the bottles I've bought, which was a bit concerning. I hope it wasn't a manufacturing issue, but I'm not quite sure yet. 

Overall, I'm a fan of Tide Free & Gentle. It's a gentle, hypoallergenic option for those with sensitive skin, and it gets the job done without any added dyes or perfumes. If the liquid weren't so messy and the cloudy issue was resolved, this would be a top choice for me.

I recently decided to switch to plant-based laundry detergent to reduce my environmental impact. After trying a few different options, I discovered Tide Purclean Unscented liquid laundry detergent. Being the first plant-based detergent with Tide's cleaning power, I was intrigued to try it out. 

When I opened the bottle, I was immediately struck by the light, fresh scent. I've always enjoyed powerful fragrances in my laundry, so I was initially hesitant about this unscented option. However, the subtle aroma quickly won me over. It was light enough to be pleasant but not overpowering, making it perfect for those sensitive to strong scents. 

The detergent itself was thick and creamy, which I found encouraging. I usually use a high-efficiency (HE) washer, so I was curious how the plant-based version would perform. To my surprise, it worked just as well as my previous detergent, leaving my clothes clean and fresh after each wash. I also appreciated that it was EPA Safer Choice certified and free of dyes, perfumes, and harsh chemicals. 

Despite my overall satisfaction, I did notice some downsides. When I first started using the detergent, I found that it created quite a bit of foam during washing, which required me to adjust my load size accordingly. Additionally, the cost of the plant-based detergent is slightly higher than its non-plant-based counterparts. 

In conclusion, Tide Purclean Unscented liquid laundry detergent is an eco-friendly and effective option for those looking to reduce their environmental impact. Its light fragrance and plant-based ingredients make it a great choice for those with sensitive skin or allergies. While it may not be perfect, it has become a staple in my laundry routine, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a sustainable cleaning solution.

It's perfect for my sensitive skin, and my clothes feel soft and comfortable to wear. 

Another thing I love about this detergent is how easy it is to dispense. The cap has a built-in measuring system, so you don't have to worry about measuring out the right amount of detergent. It's just a simple twist, and you're ready to go. 

However, one downside I've noticed is that the detergent does tend to settle in the bottle after a while. It's not enough to affect the cleaning power of the detergent, but it can be a bit annoying to have to give the bottle a good shake before each use. 

Overall, I'm really happy with my decision to switch to Tide Plus Febreze Sport Odor Defense HE Turbo Clean liquid laundry detergent. It's effective, gentle, and easy to use. It's definitely worth the investment for anyone looking for a high-quality detergent to keep their workout and athletic gear smelling fresh.
