### [Turquoise Indoor/Outdoor Throw Pillow by Waverly](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Teal+Pillows?utm\_term=turquoise-indoor-outdoor-throw-pillow-by-waverly)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Teal+Pillows?utm_term=turquoise-indoor-outdoor-throw-pillow-by-waverly"><img alt="waverly-solid-wash-20-x-20-turquoise-indoor-outdoor-throw-pillow-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/waverly-solid-wash-20-x-20-turquoise-indoor-outdoor-throw-pillow-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Waverly Solid Wash Turquoise Indoor/Outdoor Throw Pillow for a few months now, and it's become a staple in my outdoor seating area. The 20-inch square size is perfect for adding a pop of color to my furniture, and I love how it pairs with other solid and patterned pillows. Handmade with soft polyester fabric, it's both comfortable and stylish. 

One of the highlights for me is the removable polyester insert and zipper closure, which makes it very convenient to clean and maintain. However, I did notice that the color is a bit brighter than it appears in the photo, so potential buyers should be aware of that. 

Overall, I'm happy with my purchase, and the affordable price tag makes this a great addition to any indoor or outdoor space. With a quick and easy shipping process, I would definitely recommend this throw pillow to others.

These Anickal Teal Pillow Covers are a stunning addition to any home. The 100% Polyester fabric is both soft and durable, making it perfect for daily use. I loved the subtlety of the teal color, which added a pop of color to my living space without being too overpowering. The size of the covers was just right for my standard-sized pillows, and the invisible zipper made it easy to remove the covers for washing. 

One thing that did stand out was that the fabric showed some marks from folding, but I expected that with such a high-quality product. I also appreciated the variety of colors and sizes available, so I could find the perfect match for my decor. 

The only downside was that the product does not come with any insert. However, this was a minor inconvenience compared to the overall enjoyment I got from using these Teal Pillow Covers. Overall, they are a beautiful and functional addition to any home, and I highly recommend them to anyone in search of quality throw pillow covers.

I also appreciated that no assembly was required - simply open the package and you're ready to go! 

However, one drawback I noticed was the filling could be a bit more. . well, filling. They were not as plushy as I would have liked, but the tradeoff was the fabric was solid, so I can't be too picky.

## Buyer's Guide

Teal pillows can add a pop of color and comfort to any living space. Whether you're looking to jazz up your bedroom or create a cozy corner in your living room, teal pillows are an excellent choice. This buyer's guide will help you explore the important features, considerations, and advice for selecting the perfect teal pillows for your home. 


### Materials and Fabric

One of the key factors to consider when purchasing teal pillows is the material and fabric. Some common materials include feather and down, foam, and polyester. Feather and down pillows offer excellent support and can be quite comfortable, but they may not be as durable as other materials. Foam and polyester pillows are more durable and maintain their shape, but they might not provide the same level of comfort as feather and down. When choosing a fabric, consider factors such as breathability, stain resistance, and ease of cleaning. Popular fabrics include cotton, linen, and velvet. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Teal+Pillows"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Teal-Pillows-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Teal-Pillows-2" height="540"></a></div>


### Size and Shape

Teal pillows come in a variety of sizes and shapes to suit different preferences and needs. Common sizes include standard (18x18 inches), throw (20x20 inches), and Euro (26x26 inches). Consider the size of your furniture and how much space you have available for the pillows. Shape-wise, you can find square, rectangular, round, or bolster-style pillows. Square and rectangular pillows offer versatility in terms of placement and style, while round and bolster-style pillows add a unique touch to your decor and provide additional support for your back. 


### Color and Pattern

Teal is a versatile color that can work well in various settings. However, it's essential to consider the color scheme and existing decor of your living space. A bold, bright teal might be perfect for a more modern or eclectic interior, while a softer teal hue with subtle patterns could be more suitable for a traditional or beach-inspired style. Additionally, consider the texture of the pillow cover, as it can influence the overall aesthetic and feel of your teal pillows.

### Maintenance and Care

Lastly, think about how often you plan to use your teal pillows and how easy they will be to maintain. Look for pillows with removable, machine-washable covers to ensure easy care. Pay attention to the overall construction and materials of the pillow, as this can impact its longevity and resistance to wear and tear. By considering these factors, you can find teal pillows that are both stylish and practical for your home.

### What are teal pillows?

Teal pillows refer to decorative cushions that are available in the teal color family, including shades of blue and green. These pillows can be used to add a pop of color and texture to a room, creating a cozy and stylish atmosphere. They come in various shapes, sizes, and materials, making them versatile options for different interior designs. 

Teal pillows are popular choices for living rooms, bedrooms, outdoor spaces, and even as accent pieces for event decor. They are usually made from fabrics like cotton, linen, velvet, or silk, and may also feature unique patterns, embroidery, or embellishments to enhance their visual appeal. Some teal pillows can be found in hypoallergenic materials or with foam inserts for added comfort and support. 


### How do I choose the right teal pillow for my space?

Selecting the right teal pillow depends on the specific space where you plan to place it and the overall style you want to achieve. Consider factors such as the size and shape of the pillow, as well as the materials it's made from. For instance, if you're looking for a pillow to support your back while reading or working, you might prefer a firmer, more supportive option. 

If you're using the pillow for visual appeal only, consider the color scheme and patterns of your existing decor. A teal pillow with an eye-catching pattern or an intricate design can serve as a statement piece, helping to tie the room together and create a harmonious look. Additionally, think about the overall style of the space – whether it's contemporary, traditional, or bohemian – and choose a teal pillow that complements the ambiance.

### Can I wash a teal pillow?

Yes, most teal pillows can be washed, but it's essential to follow the care instructions provided by the manufacturer to ensure that the pillow maintains its shape, color, and overall integrity. Generally, you can wash teal pillows in a washing machine on a gentle cycle with cold water. It's best to avoid using fabric softeners, as they can make the pillow less plump and fluffy. After washing, tumble dry the pillow on a low heat setting, or air dry it if possible. 

It's also important to note that some teal pillows, particularly those with delicate fabrics or embroidery, may require hand washing or professional cleaning. Always consult the care label for specific instructions on how to properly care for your teal pillow to prolong its lifespan and maintain its appearance. 


### Are teal pillows hypoallergenic?

Not all teal pillows are hypoallergenic, but some may be made from materials that are less likely to cause allergies for people with sensitive skin or respiratory issues. Look for pillows with hypoallergenic-friendly materials like cotton, linen, or synthetic blends that have been treated with hypoallergenic coatings. 

It's also important to be aware that some fillings, like down or feathers, can trigger allergies for some individuals. In those cases, opt for alternatives like memory foam, polyester fibers, or wool, which are generally considered hypoallergenic. Always check the pillow's label for allergy warnings, and if you're unsure about a specific product, it's best to consult the manufacturer or retailer for more information.

### How do I clean stains from a teal pillow?

To clean stains from a teal pillow, start by blotting the affected area with a clean, damp cloth to remove excess dirt or residue. Then, mix a mild detergent solution with cool water, and using a clean cloth, gently dab the stain with the soapy mixture. Be careful not to scrub the area, as this could cause the stain to set or the fabric to fray. 

After the stain has been treated, rinse the pillow with cool water, and gently squeeze out excess moisture. If needed, you can repeat the cleaning process on the reverse side of the pillow. If you're dealing with a more stubborn stain, consider using a soft-bristled brush or a toothbrush to gently scrub the area in a circular motion. Always test the cleaning solution on a small, inconspicuous area of the pillow before applying it to the stain. 


### How long do teal pillows last?

The lifespan of a teal pillow depends on various factors, such as the materials used, the frequency of use, and proper care and maintenance. Generally, pillows made from good-quality materials and with proper care can last anywhere from 2 to 5 years or more. However, constantly washing or exposing the pillow to harsh chemicals, excessive sunlight, or humidity can cause the fabric to deteriorate more quickly. 

To ensure that your teal pillow lasts as long as possible, follow the manufacturer's care instructions, avoid exposing it to direct sunlight or harsh chemicals, and rotate it regularly to prevent uneven wear. If you notice any signs of wear, such as shrinking, discoloration, or fabric pilling, consider replacing the pillow before it becomes too damaged.
