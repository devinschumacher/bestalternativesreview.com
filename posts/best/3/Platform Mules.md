Slipping these shoes on made me feel like I was walking on clouds, thanks to their 5.5-inch heel and 1.6-inch platform. They definitely make a statement when you're ready to hit the town. 

However, I also encountered a couple of downsides during my experience. Firstly, I found the footspace to be a bit cramped, causing discomfort around the toe area. And, as one reviewer mentioned, it's not the most convenient choice for extended standing or sitting. 

Nonetheless, if you're looking to add a pop of color and fun to your outfit, these Platform Mules are a striking and unique choice. Just be sure to give your big toe a break occasionally and size up to avoid rubbing.

The synthetic patent leather upper was sleek and stylish, and the slip on design made it easy to put on and take off.

However, there were a few downsides to this platform mule. The approximately 3.5-inch platform block heel felt a bit high for everyday wear, and I found myself feeling a little unstable on it. Additionally, the slip on design made it difficult for me to walk in since it didn't provide much support around my ankle, causing some discomfort. 

Overall, the Get on Platform Mule is a chic and fashionable choice, but its higher than average platform and slip on design might not be the most practical option for all-day wear.

Their sleek, silver platform has a distinct charm that adds an instant party vibe to any outfit. Plus, the comfortable, synthetic soles mean I can strut around in them all day. 

However, one aspect I found a bit challenging was the open toe design. While this feature makes them perfect for summer outfits, it also means my big toe is exposed to the elements, leading to a slight discomfort on longer walks.
