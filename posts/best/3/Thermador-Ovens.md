<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Thermador+Ovens?utm_term=thermador-pro-harmony-dual-fuel-stainless-steel-range"><img alt="thermador-pro-harmony-30-stainless-steel-dual-fuel-range-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/thermador-pro-harmony-30-stainless-steel-dual-fuel-range-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Thermador Pro Harmony 30" Stainless Steel Dual Fuel Range features four-star burners that provide equal flame distribution, ensuring top-of-the-line cooking performance. Extra low select burners offer precise settings for simmering and cooking delicate dishes. With a Superfast 2-hour self-clean mode, cleaning becomes a breeze, allowing for more time spent enjoying your cooking creations. 

Inside this range, the true convection gives remarkable cooking efficiency, enabling the simultaneous baking of up to five levels of sheet pans with even results and zero flavor transfer. The quick-clean base allows for easy cleaning, and the raised, patented pedestal star burner provides perfect integration and easy cleanup. The stovetop is a dream with its convenient 30-inch footprint, perfect for smaller kitchens. 

The product has received mixed reviews from users, highlighting some great features, such as the amazing stovetop, oven baking efficiency, and overall performance.

### [Thermador Pro Harmony 48" Dual Fuel Range with Griddle Oven](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Thermador+Ovens?utm\_term=thermador-pro-harmony-48-dual-fuel-range-with-griddle-oven)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Thermador+Ovens?utm_term=thermador-pro-harmony-48-dual-fuel-range-with-griddle-oven"><img alt="prd486wdhu-thermador-pro-harmony-48-dual-fuel-range-griddle-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/prd486wdhu-thermador-pro-harmony-48-dual-fuel-range-griddle-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Recently, I was assigned the task of reviewing the Thermador Pro Harmony 48-inch dual-fuel range with a non-stick griddle. My initial impression of the product was quite impressive, especially considering the stylish, sleek design it offered as an addition to my kitchen. 

One significant feature that caught my attention was the Six Star Burners, which promised even flame distribution. While I haven't had any issues with this so far, I've noticed that it takes longer for the griddle to heat up compared to traditional ones. However, the non-stick surface ensures easy cleanup and prevents any food from sticking. 

As for the WiFi capabilities, I must say they have been a game-changer! With the Home Connect app, I can remotely monitor and preheat the stove, making it convenient for me when I'm in a hurry. Additionally, the integration with smartwatches and devices like Amazon Alexa makes life so much easier. 

However, one area where I faced a bit of a challenge was with the cleaning process. While the QuickClean Base design simplifies cleaning somewhat, the self-clean mode can be quite messy and time-consuming. It took me a while to figure out the optimal mode for cleaning, and even then, I had to manually scrub certain areas. 

Another downside I encountered was with the spare parts availability. As a user of this product for over 10 years, I can confirm that finding replacements after a certain period can be quite challenging. The warranty support was also less than satisfactory, as they only offered parts for up to 7 years after release. 

Despite the minor drawbacks, I must say that overall, the Thermador Pro Harmony 48-inch dual-fuel range with a non-stick griddle has been a reliable and convenient addition to my kitchen. Its versatility and ease of use have made cooking a much more enjoyable experience.
