### [UPPAbaby G-Link Stroller V2 Jake - Stylish and Convenient](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Uppababy+Stroller?utm\_term=uppababy-g-link-stroller-v2-jake-stylish-and-convenient)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Uppababy+Stroller?utm_term=uppababy-g-link-stroller-v2-jake-stylish-and-convenient"><img alt="uppababy-g-link-stroller-v2-jake-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/uppababy-g-link-stroller-v2-jake-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the UPPAbaby G-Link Stroller V2 Jake, and I must say, I'm quite impressed! This lightweight stroller is perfect for those who are always on the go. The aluminum frame combined with four sets of wheels provides effortless maneuverability, making it a breeze to push around. It's also spacious enough for two kids to comfortably sit side-by-side, while still being narrow enough to fit through tight spaces. 

One of my favorite features is the independent, one-handed adjustable reclines, which come in handy when trying to soothe a fussy child on the go. The storage pockets on the back of the [canopies](https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativesreview.com/blob/main/posts/best/1/Canopies.md) are another plus, as they keep essentials within reach without making the stroller look cluttered. 

However, there are a couple of minor drawbacks. Firstly, the stroller might not be as easy to fold up as some other models, requiring a bit of finesse to get it right. Additionally, the sunshade might not offer the greatest protection for younger babies, as it's positioned higher up. 

Overall, the UPPAbaby G-Link Stroller V2 Jake is a fantastic choice for parents who need a lightweight, easy-to-maneuver stroller for their daily adventures. While it has a few minor drawbacks, the pros far outweigh the cons, making it a solid contender for any parent's shortlist.

I recently had the chance to try out the new 2018 UPPAbaby G-LUXE Jordan Stroller in grey. As a mom with a young toddler, every bit of convenience counts - and this product certainly delivered. The stroller weighs in at just 16 pounds, making it light and easy to carry around. The one-handed actuated recline and adjustable footrest make it perfect for naps on the go, while the large stretch knit canopy with extendable UPF 50+ sunshade provided excellent sun and wind protection for my little one. 

One of the standout features of the G-LUXE is its flexibility. Whether I was running errands or catching the sights during naptime, my child could sleep comfortably in the reclining seat. The stroller is designed with a sturdy and sleek frame that can also be folded up and thrown over the shoulder using the convenient carrying strap. It was a great stroller for theme parks, zoos, and mall visits. 

Despite its many pros, I did notice a couple of downsides. Folding the stroller took some getting used to, but once I got the hang of it, it was pretty easy. There was also no peekaboo window on the canopy, and the ride was not very smooth, making it unsuitable for long walks. 

Overall, the UPPAbaby G-LUXE Jordan Stroller in grey is a convenient and reliable travel companion for parents of young children. Its unique blend of flexibility, comfort, and style makes it an excellent choice for everyday outings and travel.
