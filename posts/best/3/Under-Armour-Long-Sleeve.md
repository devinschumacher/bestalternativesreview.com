### [Under Armour UA Tech 1/2 Zip Long Sleeve Top](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Under+Armour+Long+Sleeve?utm\_term=under-armour-ua-tech-1-2-zip-long-sleeve-top)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Under+Armour+Long+Sleeve?utm_term=under-armour-ua-tech-1-2-zip-long-sleeve-top"><img alt="under-armour-ua-tech-1-2-zip-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/under-armour-ua-tech-1-2-zip-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try out the Under Armour UA Tech 1/2 Zip, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations. The first thing that struck me was just how lightweight and comfortable this shirt is. The cut is sleek and modern, making it perfect for layering under sweaters or wearing on its own. 

One of my favorite features of this long sleeve is the moisture-wicking technology. Even on the sweatiest of workouts, it does an impeccable job of keeping me dry and comfortable. And let me tell you, as someone who often gets hot and clammy during exercise, that's quite the feat. Another major plus is the quick-drying material - once I'm done with my workout, I can toss this shirt in the washing machine and have it ready for the next day in no time. 

However, there were a couple of things that I noticed could use some improvement. While the material is soft and breathable, it did tend to bunch up a bit around my arms during some of my more vigorous exercises. I found that the sleeves could be a bit longer to prevent this from happening. Additionally, while I appreciated the streamlined fit, I would have loved to see a few more color options to choose from. 

Overall, I was very impressed with the Under Armour UA Tech 1/2 Zip. Its combination of lightweight comfort, quick-drying technology, and moisture-wicking properties makes it a great addition to any workout wardrobe. Yes, there are a few minor flaws that I'd love to see addressed, but they're not deal-breakers for me. So, if you're looking for a comfortable and reliable long sleeve for your next exercise session, give the Under Armour UA Tech 1/2 Zip a try.

I love the half zip design that lets me easily regulate my body temperature. Plus, the new streamlined fit feels fantastic on my body, and the anti-odor technology keeps me smelling fresh even after the toughest workouts.

### [Under Armour Waffle Long Sleeve Crew](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Under+Armour+Long+Sleeve?utm\_term=under-armour-waffle-long-sleeve-crew)

The sweat-wicking and fast-drying properties were a game-changer for me, as I love the feeling of moisture-free clothing. 

What sets this sweatshirt apart from others is its 4-way stretch material, allowing me to move freely in any direction without restriction. The raglan sleeves created a unique and flattering fit, and the pull-on closure made it easy to slip on and off. 

One minor downside I encountered was in the loose fitment, particularly around the chest and arms. While some customers prefer a looser fit, it wasn't the most flattering look on me. An added 3% Spandex for extra stretch might have been beneficial in maintaining a better fit. 

Overall, the Under Armour Waffle Crew Long Sleeve Sweatshirt is a fantastic choice for those looking for a lightweight, warm, and versatile long sleeve. With its comfy waffle knit fabric and 4-way stretch, it's the perfect addition to anyone's wardrobe, especially during the cooler months.

I recently tried the Under Armour UA Heatgear Armour Long Sleeve and I must say, it lived up to its promises! It felt like I was wearing a hug on a hot summer day. The mesh fabric not only breathes well but also wicks away sweat, which was perfect for my daily workouts. The fit was comfortable and seamless, just as the reviews said. It was flatlock seams that made it chafe-free and moved in every direction due to the 4-way stretch construction. As a woman who enjoys wearing fitted clothes, I appreciated that it had a fitted profile while still allowing me to move freely. I also loved the added sun protection it provided and made me feel protected during my outdoor workouts. 

However, there were a couple of drawbacks. First, it was rather prone to catching on my sport bra, which was something I hadn't expected from a performance baselayer.

Overall, I'm very satisfied with the Under Armour Men's Tech Team Long Sleeve. The high-quality fabric, comfortable fit, and versatile design make it a great choice for anyone looking for a reliable long-sleeve shirt for their workouts.

One of the standout features of this base layer is its ability to wick away sweat and dry quickly, keeping me comfortable even in moderate humidity. The UA Scent Control Technology has been a godsend during long workouts, ensuring that I stay undetectable to my adversaries. 

However, I've noticed a slightly disappointing aspect of the product – the 4-way stretch construction moves better in every direction, but the material is not as stretchy as expected. This can be a bit restrictive when I'm warming up my joints. 

Despite this minor drawback, I wholeheartedly recommend the Under Armour Men's ColdGear Base 3.0 Crew - Black as an essential part of your winter sports arsenal, offering unrivaled warmth and adaptability for extreme weather conditions.
