### What metals are used in Pandora Princess Ring settings?

Pandora Princess Rings use nickel-free hypoallergenic metal for their settings. The most common metals are rose gold-filled, which combines a gold-colored exterior with a base metal core for durability.

These rings should be cleaned regularly with warm water and mild soap, using a soft-bristled brush if necessary. Avoid using harsh chemicals or ultrasonic cleaners as they can damage the delicate settings. 

Store the ring in its original packaging or a soft jewelry pouch to prevent scratches and tangles. Pandora recommends having the ring professionally cleaned annually for optimal maintenance.
