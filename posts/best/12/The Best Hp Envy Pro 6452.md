## FAQ


### What's the difference between HP Envy Pro 6452 and 6452m?

The 6452 Pro series typically features a higher refresh rate display, better graphics performance, and additional ports compared to the standard 6452 model. It's designed for professional use and high-performance gaming. 

The 6452m variant usually has a faster processor and more powerful graphics, making it suitable for demanding applications like 3D rendering and gaming. 


### What's the recommended setup for gaming with this monitor?

For gaming, we recommend using the 6452 Pro model with a gaming-grade graphics card like an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 or better. This setup will deliver smooth 144Hz gaming at 1080p resolution. 

The 6452m variant works best with at least an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 or similar card for comfortable gaming at 1440p resolution. 


### Can this monitor be used with multiple PCs?

Yes, most 6452 variants support multi-stream transport (MST) technology, allowing you to extend your desktop across two PCs using a single DisplayPort cable. 

For dual-PC setups, both computers need to be DisplayPort 1.2 compatible and have an MST hub or DisplayPort 1.4 ports available. 


### What software options are available for this monitor?

The monitor supports standard calibration software like DisplayCAL and X-Rite i1Display Pro for accurate color profiles. It also works with gaming-specific software like NVIDIA G-Sync and AMD FreeSync. 

For professional use, you can install calibration tools like CalMAN or Datacolor SpyderX to create custom color profiles for design work or photography. 


### How does the ergonomic stand compare to competitors?

The stand offers basic height adjustment and pivot functionality, but lacks the extensive tilting capabilities found in monitors from manufacturers like BenQ or Dell. 

For most users, the built-in stand provides adequate desk space, though taller users might prefer additional arm or wall-mount options available from third-party vendors. 


### What's the difference in connectivity between models?

The standard 6452 offers USB 3.2 ports and a single DisplayPort input. The Pro version adds additional USB-C ports and higher video input standards, including DisplayPort 1.4. 

The m variant features a mix of USB 3.2 and USB 4 ports, with USB 4 offering significantly faster data transfer speeds and Thunderbolt 4 capabilities.
