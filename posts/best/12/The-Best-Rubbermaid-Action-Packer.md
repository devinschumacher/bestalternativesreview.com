## Buyer's Guide

The Rubbermaid Action Packer stands as a versatile solution for organizing and transporting gear. Its design balances durability with practicality, making it a reliable choice for various applications. 


### Capacity and Organization

The Action Packer's rectangular shape enables efficient use of space. Look for models with clear dividers and multiple compartments to maximize organization. The base typically includes dedicated spaces for items like hockey sticks or lacrosse sticks, while sides offer flexible storage for miscellaneous gear. 


### Materials and Durability

The core material is typically high-density polyethylene, providing excellent impact resistance. Quality construction prevents warping and cracking under normal use. Premium models feature reinforced corners and double-stitched seams for extended durability. 


### Handle and Portability

A comfortable, secure grip is crucial, so expect to see padded, rubber-coated handles. The height of the handle affects portability - shorter handles suit younger users or those with limited reach. Rotational handles provide better control during loading and unloading. 


### Locking Mechanisms

Securing the lid properly prevents accidental openings during transport. Basic models feature a simple clip-lock mechanism, while premium versions incorporate latches or magnetic closures. Some models include child-lock options for safety when storing heavier equipment. 


## FAQ


### What is a Rubbermaid Action Packer?

A Rubbermaid Action Packer is a portable food storage container that doubles as a lunch cooler when sealed with its specialized lid. The packer features a uniquely engineered chamber separated by a floating divider that keeps food and drinks fresh through natural convection cooling. 

Known for its durability and leak-proof design, the Action Packer resists cracks and denting, while its stackable feature saves space in backpacks and lockers. The clear lid allows easy visibility of contents. 


### How does the cooling system work?

The cooling mechanism relies on convection currents created by the floating divider. As air temperature rises, cooler air sinks under the divider while warmer air rises above it, naturally circulating cool air around the food. 

For optimal cooling, place ice directly under the divider or surround the bottom of the container with frozen gel packs for best results. 


### What materials are used in the construction?

The container body is made from BPA-free, impact-resistant polycarbonate plastic that resists cracking and denting. The lid includes a silicone seal ring for leak-proof performance and easy-grip ridges for secure closure. 

The divider consists of a flexible membrane that floats within the container, preventing food spillage during movement while facilitating airflow and natural cooling. 


### What is the recommended ice-to-food ratio?

To maintain freshness for several hours, use a 1:1 ratio of ice to food volume. For longer trips or warmer conditions, increase ice quantity and consider using frozen gel packs around the edges of the container. 

Avoid overloading the container, as proper air circulation is crucial for the cooling process. Leave about 10-15% of the container empty to allow for air movement. 


### How should I clean and maintain the container?

Hand wash the container with mild soap and warm water after each use. Avoid harsh scrubbers or abrasive cleaners that could damage the floating divider or lining. 

Store containers flat when not in use to prevent warping. For travel, empty the container completely and allow it to air dry completely before reusing. 


### What are the temperature and storage limitations?

Do not immerse the container in water above 120°F (49°C) as excessive heat can warp the plastic. Avoid freezer use as the rapid temperature changes may affect the seal or divider's integrity. 

Always inspect the silicone seal and divider before each use for signs of wear or damage. Replace the container if any cracks, distortion, or leaks are detected.
