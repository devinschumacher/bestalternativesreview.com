## FAQ


### What is a bullet juicer?

A bullet juicer, also known as a dash or masticating juicer, uses slow, cold-press technology to extract juice from fruits and vegetables. This method minimizes heat generation and oxidation, resulting in more nutrient retention and better-tasting juice. 

Unlike centrifugal juicers that use high-speed blades, bullet juicers feature a single auger that slowly crushes and extracts juice, making them ideal for leafy greens and tough ingredients. 


### What types of ingredients work best in a bullet juicer?

Bullet juicers excel with tough, fibrous ingredients that other juicers struggle with. They're particularly effective for leafy greens like kale and spinach, as well as vegetables with high water content like cucumbers and carrots. 

These juicers also handle fruits well, especially those with seeds and pits like apples and pears. However, some models may struggle with very soft fruits like bananas or overly ripe produce. 


### How do I properly maintain my bullet juicer?

Always clean your bullet juicer immediately after use to prevent residue buildup. Hand wash all parts with mild soap and warm water, paying special attention to the auger and feed chute. 

Store your juicer in a dry place when not in use. Regular cleaning and proper maintenance will extend the life of your juicer and ensure optimal performance. 


### What are the main benefits of using a bullet juicer?

Bullet juicers retain more nutrients and antioxidants due to their cold-press technology, which minimizes heat exposure and oxidation. This results in a more nutritious, less oxidized juice with a longer shelf life. 

These juicers are also quieter and more efficient, requiring less electricity and producing less heat. The slower juicing process allows for better extraction of juice from tough ingredients like leafy greens. 


### How long does it take to clean a bullet juicer?

Cleaning a bullet juicer typically takes about 15-20 minutes per use. This includes taking apart all components, cleaning each piece thoroughly, and reassembling the machine. 

For optimal maintenance, it's best to clean immediately after juicing while the parts are still slightly moist, as this makes residue easier to remove. 


### What accessories are available for bullet juicers?

Standard accessories include replacement filters, additional screens for different juice consistency options, and cleaning brushes for hard-to-reach areas. 

Some premium models offer features like automatic cleaning cycles, faster processing modes for softer ingredients, and advanced filtration systems for removing pulp completely.
