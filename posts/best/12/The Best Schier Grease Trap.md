The secures cover and flow-diffusing baffle trap design make it a reliable choice for restaurants and food service operations where grease buildup can cause major plumbing issues. 


## Buyer's Guide

Schier grease traps are specialized filtration systems designed to remove cooking oils and fats from restaurant wastewater, preventing clogs in sewage lines and maintaining environmental compliance. These essential appliances require careful consideration of several key factors to ensure optimal performance and longevity. 


### Capacity and Flow Rate

Select a grease trap with a capacity that matches your restaurant's waste production. Common sizes range from 100 to 1,000 gallons. The trap's flow rate specification should accommodate your kitchen's water usage without excessive backflow, typically measured in gallons per minute (GPM).

### Material and Construction

Stainless steel offers superior durability and corrosion resistance but can be more expensive. For budget-conscious options, consider polyethylene or plastic traps with reinforced interiors. The trap's construction should include smooth interior surfaces to prevent oil film buildup and simplify cleaning. 


### Maintenance Requirements

Regular cleaning is crucial for maintaining grease trap effectiveness. Look for models with accessible inspection ports and removable covers for easy maintenance. Automatic float devices that signal when the trap needs cleaning are recommended for busy commercial kitchens.

### Environmental Compliance

Local regulations may require specific trap designs or capacities. Consider traps that meet NSF standards for food service equipment. Some models include filtration media to break down fats before they reach sewer lines, reducing maintenance needs and environmental impact. 


## FAQ

### What is the primary function of a Schier Grease Trap?

A Schier Grease Trap removes fats, oils, and greases (FOG) from restaurant and commercial kitchen wastewater before it reaches the sewer system. This prevents FOG buildup in pipes, which can cause severe blockages and overflows. 

The trap works by slowing down and cooling the wastewater, allowing FOG to solidify and separate from the water. It's typically installed at the point where wastewater exits the kitchen, such as near floor drains or dishwashing stations. 


### How does a Schier Grease Trap prevent sewer backups?

FOG solidifies in grease traps, forming a natural barrier that prevents solids and greasy materials from entering the sewer system. This reduces the risk of grease buildup in pipes, which can cause blockages and backups. 

The trap's design also slows down wastewater flow, giving FOG particles time to separate and settle. This further reduces the volume of solids entering the sewer, maintaining smooth flow and preventing backups.

### What maintenance requirements are associated with Schier Grease Traps?

Regular cleaning is essential to maintain a Schier Grease Trap's effectiveness. The trap should be cleaned weekly, removing solidified FOG and other debris. Proper cleaning prevents the trap from becoming overwhelmed and backing up into the kitchen. 

Additional maintenance includes inspecting the trap's seal and ensuring it's properly installed. Regular servicing by a professional plumber can also identify potential issues before they cause problems. 


### How do Schier Grease Traps compare to alternative wastewater treatment solutions?

Grease traps are specifically designed to handle FOG and kitchen wastewater, making them the most suitable option for restaurant and commercial kitchen applications. Alternative systems may not effectively remove these materials, leading to higher sewer cleanup costs and potential legal issues. 

While more expensive than basic traps, Schier Grease Traps offer superior performance and longevity through their efficient design and durable construction materials.

### What factors influence the selection of a Schier Grease Trap?

The trap's capacity should match the kitchen's wastewater flow volume. Factors affecting flow include the number of kitchen sinks, dishwashers, and cooking equipment, as well as the frequency of use. 

Installation requirements vary based on local plumbing codes and kitchen layout. Consider accessibility for maintenance, water pressure, and the distance from the kitchen to the sewer line when selecting a trap. 


### Are Schier Grease Traps suitable for residential use?

While smaller Schier grease traps may be suitable for some residential applications, they're primarily designed for commercial kitchens. Home kitchens typically generate less wastewater flow and FOG volume, making specialized residential traps more appropriate. 

For residential use, consider traps specifically designed for household kitchen waste, which may have different capacity and maintenance requirements compared to commercial-grade units.
