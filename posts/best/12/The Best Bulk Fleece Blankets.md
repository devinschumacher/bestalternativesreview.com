## Buyer's Guide

Bulk fleece blankets offer a cost-effective solution for adding warmth and comfort to your living space. Whether you're looking to stock up for your family or find the perfect gift, understanding the key aspects of these blankets will help you make an informed choice. 


### Size and Quantity Considerations

When purchasing bulk fleece blankets, consider both the individual blanket sizes and the total quantity needed. Standard sizes include twin (66" by 90"), queen (90" by 90"), and king (108" by 90"). For bulk purchases, companies often offer discounts when buying multiple sets of the same size. Calculate your needs based on how many blankets per person you want to provide coverage for different sleeping arrangements.

### Material Quality and Thickness

The quality of fleece material affects both the blanket's warmth and its durability. Higher-quality fleece uses thicker yarns and more expensive manufacturing processes, resulting in better insulation and softer texture. The fleece's thickness is measured in grams per square meter (gsm), with higher numbers indicating thicker blankets. For heavy winter use, look for blankets with 300gsm or more, while lighter spring and fall blankets can be around 220gsm. 


### Care Requirements and Maintenance

Bulk fleece blankets usually require standard household care. Most manufacturers recommend machine washing in cold water with similar colors and air drying or tumble drying on low heat. Avoid fabric softeners as they can shrink the fleece fibers. For bulk purchases, consider blankets with stain-resistant properties if they will be shared or used by children and pets. 

![Bulk-Fleece-Blankets-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Bulk-Fleece-Blankets-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Additional Features to Consider

Bulk fleece blankets often come in various designs, from solid colors to patterns. Consider the blanket's intended use: solid colors work well for every room, while patterns might be more suitable for bedroom use. Some bulk purchases offer different weight options in one order, allowing you to customize warmth levels by room or season. Check if the seller offers flexible return policies, as returns might be necessary when mixing multiple blankets for different warmth requirements. 


## FAQ

![Bulk-Fleece-Blankets-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Bulk-Fleece-Blankets-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What makes fleece blankets better than other types of blankets?

Fleece blankets combine warmth with lightweight portability, thanks to their dense polyester construction. Unlike cotton, which can retain moisture and get heavy when wet, or down, which is expensive and requires regular care, fleece dries quickly and maintains its shape. This synthetic material also resists mildew and doesn't attract dust mites, making it an ideal choice for households with allergies or pets. 

These blankets retain heat exceptionally well due to their high warmth-to-weight ratio, plus they wick away moisture, keeping you dry during those chilly nights. The soft, plush texture of quality fleece blankets provides lasting comfort without the bulk of traditional winter bedding. 


### How do you choose the right size fleece blanket?

The most common sizes for bulk fleece blankets are twin (66" x 90") and queen (85" x 90"). For single beds, twin blankets are sufficient and cost-effective, while queen-size options provide generous coverage for larger beds or shared sleepers. Factor in the intended use - whether it's for bed, couch, or outdoor camping - to determine the ideal dimensions. 

Consider the additional space around the bed when selecting a blanket size. A twin blanket might overflow slightly on a queen mattress, while a king-sized bed requires the generous dimensions of a queen blanket. Bulk purchases often come in standardized sizes, so measure your specific needs before buying to avoid returns.

### What are the key factors to consider when buying a bulk fleece blanket?

When selecting bulk fleece blankets, prioritize the thickness, or "density, " of the material. Higher quality blankets range from 10 to 15 ounces per square yard, providing superior warmth without excessive weight. The construction should include a soft, comfortable face fabric with a durable backing for longevity. 

Check the details on the label for specifications on the fill weight and material composition. Higher-quality fleece should be made from premium polyester that resists pilling and maintains its shape over time. Pay attention to the seam quality and closure options, as these affect both comfort and durability. 


### How should you care for bulk fleece blankets?

Most fleece blankets can be machine washed in a gentle cycle with similar colors using mild detergent. The key is to avoid harsh detergents, bleach, or fabric softeners, which can damage the fabric quality. To extend the life and maintain the plush texture, consider washing them alone or with other similar items to prevent snagging. 

For drying, use a low heat setting and remove the blanket while it's still slightly damp to shape and prevent excessive wrinkling. Air drying is even better, but if using a dryer, use a low heat setting and remove when still slightly damp. Pilling can be reduced by using a gentle wool sweater ball during the first few washes.

### What are the major brands known for bulk fleece blankets?

Popular brands recognized for their bulk fleece blankets include Warm'n'Cozy, PlushBeds, and The Fleece Blanket Company. These brands consistently deliver high-quality products with attention to detail in terms of warmth and durability. Each offers a range of sizes and colors suitable for both casual and premium bedding needs.

### Are bulk fleece blankets suitable for year-round use?

While bulk fleece blankets excel in moderate temperatures and during cooler seasons, their performance varies with the climate where you live. In warmer regions, they provide effective year-round comfort, while in colder climates, they function best as supplemental bedding rather than primary blankets. 

When considering bulk purchases, think about the average temperature of your living environment and your heating setup. For most households with typical heating systems, a bulk fleece blanket serves as a versatile layer in the 60-80Â°F range, making it adaptable for changing seasons without the need for multiple heavy blankets.
