## Buyer's Guide

A well-chosen RTIC backpack cooler can transform your outdoor adventures by keeping your drinks and food fresh. These portable coolers combine durability with reliable temperature control, making them a practical addition to any outdoor enthusiast's gear collection. 


### Capacity and Dimensions

Select a cooler based on how much you need to carry. Consider the total number of items and their sizes when determining the appropriate capacity. RTIC coolers come in various sizes, from small 4.3-quart models to large 60-quart versions, so choose one that balances your storage needs with portability. 


### Insulation Quality

Look for coolers with thick wall construction and multiple layers of insulation. Higher-quality RTIC coolers feature walls between 4 and 8 inches thick, which provide better temperature retention. The insulation type also matters—closed-cell foam offers superior protection against temperature fluctuations. 


### Access and Organization

Organizational features enhance usability and help maintain food safety. Multiple compartments with lids or sleeves keep similar items together and prevent mixing of contents. The number of handles and their placement should accommodate different carrying styles, whether you're backpacking or using the cooler as a portable beverage center. 


### Maintenance and Durability

Construction quality affects how long your cooler will perform reliably. RTIC coolers use durable materials like polyethylene or polycarbonate, which resist impact damage and scratches. Check if the cooler has a powder-coated exterior finish for increased scratch resistance and UV protection. 


## FAQ


### What sizes are available?

The Rtic Backpack Cooler comes in two sizes: 40L and 60L. The 40L model measures 19.05" L x 13" W x 13" H, while the 60L model is 25.59" L x 13" W x 13" H. 

Both sizes feature the same insulation technology and double-wall construction, but the larger capacity obviously provides more cold storage. 


### What materials are used?

The cooler's outer shell is made from 600D polyester, which is both durable and water-resistant. The interior is lined with BPA-free, dishwasher-safe polyethylene. 

The lid and base are constructed from impact-resistant ABS plastic, while the handles are made from soft-touch TPU rubber. 


### How much does it weigh?

The 40L Rtic Backpack Cooler weighs approximately 6.8 pounds empty, while the 60L model tips the scales at 10.2 pounds. 

Despite the added capacity, both models remain surprisingly lightweight for their size, making them practical for backpacking or outdoor adventures. 


### What features enhance portability?

At the top of each cooler is a padded carrying handle that doubles as a leash attachment point. Both sizes also feature detachable shoulder straps for hands-free carrying. 

The 60L model includes a waist belt and back panel for added stability during long hikes or trips. 


### How well does it maintain temperature?

Equipped with Dual-Phase Gel insulation and a reflective vapor barrier, the Rtic cooler maintains its temperature for 3-4 days with a full load and proper usage. 

The lid has a quick-lock mechanism that creates a seal when closed, preventing warm air from entering and preserving the cold inside. 


### What's included in the package?

Each Rtic cooler comes with a built-in ice pack, a drain plug with rubber seal, and a carrying bag. 

The 60L model includes an additional water bottle sleeve on the lid and a divider plate to separate different foods and drinks.
