## Buyer's Guide

Choosing the right Robertson screwdriver is crucial for both efficiency and longevity of your tools. This guide covers essential features, material options, and practical considerations to help you select the perfect screwdriver for your needs. 


### Bit Compatibility

Robertson drivers use hexagonal bits that fit into the driver's socket. Common bit sizes include 1/4", 5/16", and 3/8". Consider which bit sizes you'll need most frequently, as carrying additional bit sets adds weight. For most home maintenance tasks, 1/4" and 5/16" bits are sufficient. 


### Material and Construction

The driver's handle material affects both comfort and resistance to wear. Impact drivers and heavy-duty tasks benefit from metal handles, which provide better torque transfer. For general use, composite or fiberglass handles offer excellent balance between weight and durability while keeping the tool relatively light. 


### Torque Control and Precision

Professional-grade Robertson drivers often include torque settings that prevent over-tightening, which can damage both the screw and workpiece. Look for models with adjustable torque limits or click-stop mechanisms that indicate when the preset torque has been reached. 


### Handle Design and Length

Handle diameter should allow a comfortable grip while preventing slippage. Most standard handles measure between 1/2" and 5/8", but larger hands may prefer thicker handles. The driver's length affects reach and control - shorter drivers are more maneuverable in tight spaces, while longer drivers provide more torque for driving deep screws. 


## FAQ


### What makes a Robertson screwdriver unique?

Robertson screwdrivers feature a distinctive square-shaped recess in the head, designed to prevent slippage and stripping of screws. This unique geometry provides superior torque distribution compared to traditional Phillips or flat-head designs. 

The square recess requires specialized sockets, which can be an advantage in tight spaces or when precise torque application is needed. However, these specialized tools can be more expensive and less common than standard screwdriver bits. 


### Which materials are Robertson screwdrivers typically made from?

Most Robertson screwdrivers are available in stainless steel or high-carbon steel. These materials offer good durability and resistance to rust, making them suitable for both residential and commercial applications. 

Some premium models incorporate steel alloy construction for enhanced strength and longevity, particularly in heavy-duty industrial use. These premium options often include additional features like insulated handles for electrical work. 


### How should I maintain a Robertson screwdriver?

Clean the tool regularly with a soft cloth to remove debris and prevent corrosion. For stubborn dirt or residue, use a mild cleaner and brush before drying thoroughly. 

Store the screwdriver in a dry place and avoid using it as a pry bar or chisel, as this can damage the precision-machined head and reduce its lifespan. 


### What is the recommended torque range for Robertson screwdrivers?

Standard Robertson screwdrivers typically come with torque ratings between 10 and 40 inch-pounds (1.4 to 5.5 Nm), suitable for most household and light-duty applications. Industrial models may extend this range to 100 inch-pounds (14 Nm) or more. 

Always refer to the manufacturer's specifications for the specific tool you're using, as torque requirements can vary based on the application and screw type. 


### Can I use a regular screwdriver in a Robertson socket?

While standard flat-head or Phillips bits can sometimes fit Robertson sockets, this is not recommended. The geometry of the screwdriver head is specifically designed for square recesses, and using non-specialized bits can damage both the tool and the socket. 

For optimal performance and longevity, use only the correct Robertson bit in compatible sockets. This ensures proper torque application and prevents premature wear on the tool. 


### How do I select the right size Robertson screwdriver?

Robertson screwdrivers are available in a range of sizes, typically measured by the width of the square head in millimeters (e. g. , 2.0mm, 2.5mm, 3.0mm). The appropriate size depends on the screw being removed or installed. 

For general home use, common sizes include 2.5mm and 3.0mm. Industrial applications may require larger sizes. Always measure the screw head before selecting a tool to ensure proper fit.
