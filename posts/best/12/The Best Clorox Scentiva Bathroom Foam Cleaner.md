## Buyer's Guide

Bathroom foam cleaners offer a convenient and effective solution for maintaining bathroom hygiene. Clorox Scentiva is a popular choice, combining foam texture with pleasant fragrance. Here's what to consider when selecting a bathroom foam cleaner. 


### Foam Texture and Application

The foam texture should be consistent and easily applied, allowing for even coverage on surfaces. Look for products that form a light, lasting foam that adheres well to vertical surfaces like shower walls and doors. 


### Cleaning Power and Ingredients

Effective bathroom cleaners break down tough stains and germs. Ingredients like hydrogen peroxide, acid-based cleaners, and plant-derived surfactants work together to deliver powerful results while breaking down greasy residue and mineral deposits. 


### Scent and Freshness

A pleasant scent enhances the cleaning experience and helps mask bathroom odors. Clorox Scentiva features a popular melon scent that disperses naturally from the foam. The fragrance should be subtle yet noticeable after cleaning. 


### Convenience and Packaging

Handheld foam dispensers provide the most convenient application method. Look for products with sturdy, easy-to-grip handles and trigger mechanisms designed for one-hand operation. The packaging should be practical for bathroom storage, with a secure lid and practical size for daily use.

### What surfaces can Clorox Scentiva Bathroom Foam Cleaner be used on?

The cleaner is safe for use on multiple surfaces including ceramic tile, glass, stainless steel, and other smooth, water-resistant materials commonly found in bathrooms. It effectively removes soap scum, mold, and mildew from these surfaces while leaving behind a fresh scent. 

However, it's important to note that the product is not recommended for porous materials such as natural stone, wood, or unsealed concrete. Direct contact with painted surfaces or electronic equipment should be avoided to prevent damage or residue buildup. 


### Is Clorox Scentiva Bathroom Foam Cleaner safe for my family?

Yes, the cleaner contains no harsh chemicals and is designed to be family-safe. Made with a natural, plant-based formula, it's gentle enough for daily use around your home while effectively protecting against harmful bacteria and mold. 

After cleaning, the product dries clear and doesn't leave any visible residue. The gentle lavender scent makes it suitable for households with children and pets, though it's always a good idea to keep all cleaning products out of reach of pets and young children. 


### How long does the fresh scent last after cleaning?

The Clorox Scentiva formula provides a lasting fresh scent that typically lasts up to 24 hours after cleaning. The natural lavender scent remains noticeable without being overpowering, and the product's odor-eliminating properties help maintain a fresh bathroom environment. 

If you notice the scent fading before 24 hours, there's no need to reapply the cleaner - the product continues to work effectively even when the scent is no longer detectable. The odor-fighting properties also prevent new odors from developing on treated surfaces. 


### How long does Clorox Scentiva Bathroom Foam Cleaner last?

Each 12.4 oz bottle provides approximately 31 standard applications, giving you enough cleaner for about 1.5 months of regular bathroom cleaning. The product should last longer for households with fewer bathroom users or smaller spaces. 

If you notice the cleaner lasting longer than expected, it's a sign that you're using the right amount. The recommended application is a generous foamy coat per surface, so reducing the amount used may stretch the product's lifespan.
