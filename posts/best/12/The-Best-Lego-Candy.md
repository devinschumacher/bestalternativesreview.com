## Buyer's Guide

Looking for a sweet addition to your LEGO collection? Building candy-themed sets is a delicious way to expand your LEGO stash. Here's what you need to know to find the perfect confectionery creation. 


### Theme and Setting

LEGO candy sets range from standalone pieces to elaborate city scenes complete with candy stores and ice cream parlors. Consider whether you want a specific setting or a versatile piece that matches any LEGO city backdrop. 


### Building Details

These sets often feature intricate designs mimicking real candy packaging. Look for details like windows, packaging folds, and branded elements that showcase the candy's appearance. 


### Size and Complexity

The scale varies from small standalone pieces to larger sets that can stand alone or be integrated into other LEGO creations. Think about where you'll display your candy LEGO and how much space you have. 


### Add-On Opportunities

Many candy sets come with interchangeable elements or can be combined with LEGO food items. This allows you to mix and match elements to create custom candy displays or scenes. 


## FAQ


### Are Lego Candy products safe for children?

Yes, Lego Candy products are designed with safety in mind. The miniature candy pieces are made from food-grade plastic that meets international safety standards. 

While the candy pieces are small, they're specifically engineered to be harmless if swallowed. Parents should still supervise young children to prevent choking or other accidents. 


### How many pieces are included in a Lego Candy set?

Each Lego Candy set typically includes between 100 to 200 miniature candy pieces. The exact number may vary slightly between different sets. 

The number of pieces is just right for creating detailed candy displays without becoming overwhelmingly numerous. 


### What types of candy pieces are included?

The candy pieces include a mix of common candy shapes such as gummy bears, chocolate bars, and lollipops. Each set features a variety of candy types to create an authentic display. 

Note that while the pieces look like candy, they are not edible and should not be mistaken for real candy. 


### Can Lego Candy pieces damage my LEGO sets?

The miniature candy pieces are designed to be gentle on LEGO sets. They are thin and flexible, making them less likely to cause damage than larger objects. 

However, it's always a good idea to keep your LEGO sets separate from the candy pieces to prevent mixing them up. 


### How should I store Lego Candy pieces?

Store Lego Candy pieces in their original packaging or a clear container with a lid. This helps protect them from dust and maintains their condition. 

Avoid using air-tight containers as the pieces need some ventilation to prevent moisture buildup. 


### How durable are the Lego Candy pieces?

The plastic used in Lego Candy pieces is durable and resistant to wear and tear. They can withstand regular handling and display without easily becoming damaged. 

However, like all plastic toys, they should be kept away from sharp objects or extreme heat to maintain their condition.
