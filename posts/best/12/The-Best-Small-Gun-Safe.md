## Buyer's Guide

A small gun safe serves as a secure storage solution for personal firearms, offering protection from theft and environmental damage. When selecting a small gun safe, consider the safe's dimensions, lock type, and fire resistance rating to ensure it meets your storage needs while remaining practical for everyday use. 


### Sizing and Storage Capacity

Measure the available space where the safe will be stored to determine the appropriate dimensions. Small gun safes typically measure between 12 to 24 inches in height and 12 to 18 inches in width, with depths ranging from 6 to 12 inches. Consider the number of guns and any additional items you plan to store, as well as the space required for proper gun positioning and airflow. 


### Locking Mechanism

Small gun safes employ various locking mechanisms, including combination locks, digital keypads, and biometric scanners. Combination locks offer basic security and are more affordable, but digital keypads provide greater convenience and security with programmable access codes. Biometric scanners offer superior security through fingerprint recognition but come with higher initial costs and potential maintenance requirements. 


### Fire Resistance Rating

Evaluate the safe's fire resistance rating based on your climate and local storage conditions. Look for safes with UL (Underwriters Laboratories) ratings of at least 30 minutes for standard home storage and 60 minutes for areas with higher fire risk. Higher ratings provide better protection but may increase the safe's weight and cost. 


### Maintenance and Durability

Choose a manufacturer with a reliable reputation for quality and customer service. Consider the safe's construction materials, with steel and steel-composite safes offering the best balance of security and durability. Regular maintenance includes checking door seals, ensuring proper ventilation, and testing the locks to maintain optimal security over time.
