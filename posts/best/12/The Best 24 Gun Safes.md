## Buyer's Guide

A 24 gun safe is an essential investment for firearm owners, providing secure storage while meeting modern safety standards. These safes offer reliable protection against theft, fire, and environmental damage. Understanding the key features will help you choose the right safe for your needs and budget. 


### Capacity and Organization

24 gun safes typically accommodate between 15-25 firearms, depending on size and type. Consider a safe with adjustable shelves and storage solutions like gun racks or compartments for optimal organization. This helps maximize space and ensures each firearm has proper support and separation. 


### Security Features

Look for dual-locking systems combining digital codes with biometric scanners or key locks. High-strength steel construction with multiple locking points provides superior resistance to forced entry. Some models include security alarms, anti-drill plates, and pry-bar resistant doors for added protection.
