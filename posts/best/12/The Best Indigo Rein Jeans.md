The wash is faded just right, with a hint of the original blue peeking through. The low rise gives a modern flattering silhouette without being too tight. Pair with a simple top to let these jeans shine.

Indigo Rein's juniors' skinny jeans combine just the right amount of stretch with authentic denim texture. The mid-rise fit and medium wash give them a classic look that pairs perfectly with both casual and smarter outfits. The strategic destructuring and classic roll-cuff design add a touch of effortless cool that's hard to beat in a pair of everyday jeans.

These skinnies have the Indigo Rein signature high rise, though some might find them a bit snug. The blue wash is true to color, while the star patches add a fun, memorable touch. The ankle-length style makes them perfect for casual wear. 


### [Indigo Rein Juniors Super High-Rise Ripped Skinny Jeans](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Indigo+Rein+Jeans?utm\_term=indigo-rein-juniors-super-high-rise-ripped-skinny-jeans)

Ultra-high rise paired with raw-edges creates a distinctive look in these skinny jeans. The medium wash fits true to size with a 28Â½" inseam. While some reviewers love the flattering fit, others find them tight around the hips and long in the rise. 


### [Indigo Rein Junior Skater Jeans](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Indigo+Rein+Jeans?utm\_term=indigo-rein-junior-skater-jeans)

The blue jeans feature a light wash with vintage effects like silicons and enzymes. With a high rise and wide leg design, they're perfect for creating relaxed summer looks. The slightly longer length and true-to-size fit make them a practical choice for daily wear.

These classic 94 jeans capture the effortless cool of '90s style while offering lasting appeal for any decade. The 100% cotton construction feels softly lived-in from the start, while the slightly higher waist and wide leg silhouette add a modern touch to the timeless design. Whether you're pairing them with a simple tee or a statement blouse, these jeans maintain their shape while giving your figure a flattering lift. 


## Buyer's Guide

When it comes to jeans, the Indigo Rein collection offers a distinctive blend of style and durability. These jeans combine premium denim with reinforced stitching for lasting quality, making them a thoughtful investment for your wardrobe. 


### Denim Quality and Weight

Higher-quality denim typically uses heavier weights, ranging from 11 to 14 ounces. The weight affects both feel and durability, with heavier denims lasting longer but feeling more rigid initially. Consider whether you prefer a structured silhouette that breaks in gradually or a more flexible fit that requires less breaking in time. 


### Reinforcement Details

The key reinforcement points in Indigo Rein jeans include double-stitched stress points, reinforced stitching at the waistband connection, and additional bartacking at critical stress areas. These details enhance lasting quality and prevent common wear points from failing prematurely. 


### Fit and Silhouette

Indigo Rein offers a variety of fits beyond basic straight-leg options, including bootcut and slim variations. Consider your body type and preferred silhouette when selecting a fit. The rise (low, mid, or high) can significantly impact both comfort and how the jeans sit on your body. 


### Style Elements

While the core design focuses on durability and reinforcement, style elements like pocket placement, button choice, and waistband design can vary. Some styles feature deeper pockets for better storage, while others may use distinctive buttons or belt loops for visual interest. Choose elements that complement your personal style and the primary function of the jeans. 


## FAQ


### What makes Indigo Rein Jeans different from regular jeans?

Indigo Rein Jeans are designed with premium denim that's engineered for lasting comfort and durability. Unlike regular jeans, which may fade and lose shape over time, these jeans maintain their original fit and color intensity through multiple washes. 

Their proprietary construction includes reinforced stitching and heavier-than-average thread counts in stress points, extending the life of the jeans beyond traditional standards. 


### How do I take care of Indigo Rein Jeans?

These jeans are machine washable but are best preserved through regular hand washing. Use mild detergent and cold water to maintain the denim's integrity and prevent color bleeding. 

Avoid using bleach or harsh chemicals, and air dry rather than using a dryer to prevent shrinkage and maintain the fabric's natural texture. 


### What's the return policy on Indigo Rein Jeans?

You have 30 days from purchase to return Indigo Rein Jeans in their original condition and packaging. Items must be unworn and free from any signs of usage. 

Alterations or missing accessories will affect the return eligibility. Check their website for specific instructions and return forms. 


### Are Indigo Rein Jeans available in different washes?

The primary wash is a deep indigo color that maintains its intensity over time. Additional wash options like stone wash and distressed styles are available seasonally. 

These alternative washes may show more wear over time than the standard indigo, so consider your usage patterns when selecting a wash type. 


### What sizes do Indigo Rein Jeans offer?

Standard sizes range from 00 to 14 for women and 0 to 14 for men. They offer extended sizes up to 16 for women and 16 for men, along with plus sizes in all wash options. 

The fit is true to size with slight relaxation in the thigh area, similar to traditional American jeans sizing standards. 


### How should I measure myself for these jeans?

For the best fit, measure your natural waist (about 1 inch above your belly button) and your fullest hip circumference. Use these measurements to find your correct size. 

Consider your preferred level of stretch and how you typically wear jeans when comparing your measurements to their size chart.
