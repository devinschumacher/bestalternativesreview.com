Hand-poured from paraffin-free wax, this 13-ounce mason jar candle lets you burn for up to two hours at a time, though we'd recommend using it more sparingly to keep the honey-sweet scent lingering without overwhelming your space.

The single wick does a good job of filling a room with its floral aroma, though some might find it more subtle than overpowering.

A warm Canadian apple scent spreads through the room as the premium soy wax slowly melts, revealing a rich, tart flavor that's anything but artificial. The candle's straight cotton wick and natural ingredients create a clean burn that lasts for hours, though remember to trim the wick to 0.6cm before each lighting session – that's about the thickness of a pencil lead.

## Buyer's Guide

Starting your own candle company is an exciting venture that combines creativity with entrepreneurship. Whether you're crafting homemade scented candles for hobby purposes or planning a full business launch, understanding key aspects of candle making will help you create high-quality products and build a successful business. 


### Choosing the Right Wax

The type of wax you select significantly impacts your candle's performance and longevity. Common options include paraffin, soy, beeswax, and coconut-based waxes. Consider factors like melting point, fragrance absorption, and environmental impact when making your choice. High-quality wax provides a better burning profile and reduces the risk of issues like tunneling or uneven melting. 


### Scent Selection and Blending

Scent is a crucial factor in candle appeal. Consider fragrance strength, throw distance, and compatibility with different wax types. Essential oils and fragrance oils vary in quality and longevity, so invest in premium ingredients for lasting results. Learning basic scent blending techniques allows you to create unique profiles and consistent formulations. 


### Container Options and Design

The right container enhances both the functionality and presentation of your candle. Consider materials like glass, metal, or ceramic, and think about the base size that matches your intended wick diameter. Container shape and texture affect heat dissipation and visual appeal. Proper fit between the container and wax ensures optimal burning and minimal waste. 


### Manufacturing and Quality Control

Understanding the candle-making process helps maintain consistent quality. Key steps include precise temperature control during melting, proper wick placement, and thorough cleaning between batches. Consider implementing basic quality control measures like visual inspections and burn tests.

Customers can mix and match scents or choose between clear, white, or natural glass jars to create their own unique candle. 


### What is the return policy for unsatisfactory candles?

Unopened candles can typically be returned within 30 days for a full refund or exchange. Opened candles are eligible for store credit or exchange as long as they remain in sellable condition. 

The company encourages customers to report any defects or issues with their candles for a prompt resolution. 


### Are the candles suitable for sensitive skin?

All candles are made from natural essential oils and do not contain harmful chemicals. However, individuals with severe allergies should test a small amount of the fragrance first. 

The company suggests using candles in well-ventilated areas to minimize any potential reactions.
