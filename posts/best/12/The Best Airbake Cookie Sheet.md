## Buyer's Guide

Choosing the right airbake cookie sheet is crucial for achieving perfectly baked cookies every time. This guide outlines essential features and considerations to help you select the ideal baking sheet for your kitchen. 


### Size and Shape

Standard airbake cookie sheets measure 18 inches by 12 inches, but you can also find smaller 9-inch rounds or larger 22-inch rectangles. Consider the number of cookies you typically bake and available oven space when selecting a size. The sheet's shape affects cookie spread and browning, with rectangular sheets promoting even expansion and round sheets keeping cookies compact. 


### Material and Construction

Most airbake cookie sheets are made from aluminum, which heats quickly and distributes heat evenly. Look for sheets with a thick gauge for better heat retention and durability. Some premium sheets feature stainless steel or composite materials for improved longevity and easier cleanup. Ensure the sheet has a flat bottom to prevent warping and maintain consistent baking results. 


### Non-Stick Coating

A non-stick coating helps prevent cookie sticking and facilitates easy cleanup. PFOA-free options using safer alternative coatings like ceramic or PTFE provide lasting non-stick properties without harmful chemicals. The quality of the coating varies between manufacturers, so check for warranties or test reviews to ensure lasting performance. 


### Handle Design

The handle design significantly impacts ease of use and stability during baking. Look for wide, ergonomically shaped handles that provide good grip without overheating. Some sheets feature dual handles for better balance, while others have a single handle that doubles as a folding mechanism for compact storage. Consider how you'll transport the sheet from oven to cooling rack when selecting handle placement and size. 


## FAQ


### What makes an Airbake cookie sheet different from other cookie sheets?

The Airbake cookie sheet features unique raised edges that prevent cookies from spilling over the sides during baking. These edges also promote even baking by directing heat around the edges of the cookie. 

Unlike traditional flat cookie sheets, Airbake sheets are made from high-grade aluminum with a durable, non-stick coating that prevents sticking and allows for easy cleanup. 


### Can Airbake cookie sheets be used in the oven?

Yes, Airbake cookie sheets are oven-safe and can be used in conventional ovens at temperatures up to 450°F (232°C). They are suitable for both baking and broiling. 

However, they should not be placed directly on the oven's heating elements or used in microwave ovens. 


### Are Airbake cookie sheets dishwasher-safe?

Most Airbake cookie sheets are dishwasher-safe, making them convenient for quick cleaning. However, always check the manufacturer's instructions as some models may require hand washing. 

For optimal care, hand-washing with a mild detergent is recommended, especially for new sheets where the non-stick coating might be more delicate. 


### How do I store an Airbake cookie sheet?

Store your Airbake cookie sheet in a dry place, preferably in a kitchen cabinet or pantry where it won't get damaged by heat or moisture. 

Airbake sheets typically come with locking clips that keep them stable when stacking multiple sheets. If your sheet has these clips, use them to prevent sheets from shifting during storage. 


### What should I consider when purchasing an Airbake cookie sheet?

When choosing an Airbake cookie sheet, consider the size that best matches your baking needs. Common sizes range from 12-inch to 18-inch. 

Check for any additional features like locking clips for stacking, oven-safe handles, or non-stick coatings that improve baking performance. 


### Can I use non-stick spray with Airbake cookie sheets?

While Airbake sheets have a non-stick coating, additional non-stick sprays are generally not necessary. The coating provides adequate release properties for most baking needs. 

If you find your cookies sticking frequently, try adjusting baking time or temperature, or ensure the sheet is properly preheated.
