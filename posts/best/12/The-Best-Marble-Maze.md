### Are marble mazes suitable for children?

### How should I maintain my marble maze?

To keep your marble maze in good condition, regularly clean it with a damp cloth to remove dust and debris. For plastic or metal mazes, occasional lubrication of moving parts with a silicone-based product can prevent rust or wear. 

Store the maze in a dry place when not in use to prevent damage from moisture. Wooden mazes may need periodic conditioning with furniture wax to maintain their finish.
