## Buyer's Guide

When selecting an assault treadmill, multiple factors influence performance and durability. Understanding these aspects helps in choosing equipment that matches your fitness goals and space constraints. 


### Speed and Incline Features

Look for treadmills offering both variable speed controls and adjustable incline settings. This allows gradual intensity increases during workouts, simulating outdoor running conditions while preventing sudden strain on joints.

### Motor Power and Deck Quality

Assault treadmills typically require more powerful motors and robust deck construction than standard models to handle the additional weight and impact forces. Check specifications for continuous duty motors and commercial-grade decks composed of multiple planks rather than single pieces. 


### Display and Program Features

Modern assault treadmills often include comprehensive display screens showing workout metrics like distance, time, speed, and calories burned. Consider models with additional program options for interval training, hill climbs, and predefined workout routines.

### Space and Portability

Measure available floor space before selecting a treadmill model. Some assault treadmills feature folding mechanisms to reduce footprint during storage. Weigh requirements for moving the equipment between locations, as these machines tend to be heavier than home models.
