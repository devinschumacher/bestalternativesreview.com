## Buyer's Guide

Gardenia candles blend rich floral notes with subtle hints of vanilla and musk, creating an inviting aroma that's both elegant and comforting. When selecting a gardenia candle, consider factors like fragrance intensity, burn time, and container style to find the perfect match for your space. 


### fragrance intensity

Choose a gardenia candle with an aroma that's strong enough to fill your room without being overwhelming. Consider the size of your space and personal scent preferences when determining the right fragrance intensity. 


### burn time

Look for candles with an adequate burn time that matches your usage frequency. A candle with a smaller diameter and shorter height generally burns more efficiently than a tall, bulky alternative, providing consistent scent diffusion throughout its life. 


### container style

The candle container should complement your decor while protecting your surfaces from heat damage. Opt for wide-mouthed containers with adequate ventilation to prevent pressure buildup during burning. Consider the candle's finish - matte or frosted surfaces resist fingerprints and showcase the fragrance notes better than clear or gloss finish options. 


### quality ingredients

Premium gardenia candles use natural essential oils for the flower note, which provide a more authentic scent than synthetic alternatives. The wax should be high-quality, such as soy or beeswax, which burn more cleanly and efficiently than paraffin wax. 


## FAQ


### What is the fragrance like in a Gardenia candle?

A Gardenia candle captures the pure, dewy essence of freshly opened gardenias, with a strong white floral core that combines sweetness with a subtle green note. The fragrance contains top notes of bergamot and lemon, giving it a brighter, more modern twist than traditional gardenia scents. 

The heart of the fragrance features multiple layers of gardenia, with some formulas incorporating jasmine or ylang-ylang for added complexity. Base notes of cashmere woods and vanilla provide depth and longevity to the scent, though the gardenia component remains the most prominent feature. 


### How long does the burn time typically last?

Most Gardenia candles offer around 30-35 hours of burn time, depending on the candle's size and container type. This provides ample time to enjoy the fragrance while allowing for regular trimming of the wick to prevent smoking and ensure optimal burning. 

Burn times can vary slightly based on room temperature, draft exposure, and wick care. Optimal results are achieved when burning the candle in a consistent environment, such as a single, stationary location without significant air currents. 


### What size options are available for Gardenia candles?

Standard candle sizes typically range from 8oz (227g) to 16oz (454g), offering different burn times and fragrance throw. The most common sizes are 8oz candles, which provide 30-32 hours of burn time, while 16oz candles offer approximately double the duration. 

Some manufacturers also offer travel-sized options (2oz), which burn for about 12 hours and are ideal for testing the scent or gifting. 


### How should I properly maintain a Gardenia candle?

To maximize your Gardenia candle's performance and longevity, allow the wax to melt to the container's edges during each burn. This helps establish an even "cooling rim" and prevents tunneling. Aim to burn the candle for at least two hours on the first use to establish an even pool of melted wax. 

Trim the wick to 1/4 inch before each use to maintain a clean, even burn. Extinguish the candle if excessive smoking occurs, and avoid burning it in areas with strong air currents that might alter its burn pattern. 


### Are Gardenia candles suitable for small rooms?

While Gardenia candles can fragrance small rooms effectively, their performance depends on the room's square footage and ventilation. A 8oz candle typically covers spaces up to 100 square feet, while a 16oz candle can fragrance larger rooms of 160 square feet or more. 

Consider room size when selecting a candle size. In smaller rooms, a 8oz candle is often sufficient, while larger rooms may require multiple candles or a larger size to achieve the desired intensity of the fragrance. 


### Do Gardenia candles require any special care beyond regular maintenance?

Regular maintenance through proper wick trimming and consistent burning patterns is the primary care required for Gardenia candles. The containers typically do not need special treatments or coatings, as gardenia fragrance blends well with most materials without causing discoloration or damage. 

Avoid placing the candle in direct sunlight or high-heat areas, as this can affect both the wax and the fragrance's longevity. Keep the container clean and dry, and store remaining candle in a cool, dry place when not in use to preserve its quality.
