## FAQ


### What makes the Vitamix 5200 blender unique?

The Vitamix 5200 blender features a powerful 2-horsepower motor that can handle tough ingredients with ease, while its 67mm-wide blade technology ensures smoother blending results. The blender's durable stainless steel construction and BPA-free Tritan container are backed by a 5-year warranty. 

At 13.6 cups capacity, it's suitable for making smoothies, soups, and sauces for a family of four, although it may be too large for single servings. The blender's programmable settings and multiple preset functions save time and reduce the learning curve compared to its more complex sibling models. 


### How easy is it to clean?

The blender's container and lid are dishwasher-safe, but hand washing the jar and lid is recommended for optimal durability. The blade assembly needs to be removed after each use and can be thoroughly cleaned under running water. 

The blender base and pulse button panel should be wiped clean after use. Regular maintenance includes keeping the jar lid gasket lubricated with cooking oil to ensure proper sealing and prevent leaks. 


### What are the most common accessories included?

The standard accessories for the Vitamix 5200 typically include a 16-ounce blending container, lid, blade assembly, and tamper. Additional accessories may include a 20-ounce jar, 64-ounce container, and various blending discs for different applications. 

Popular optional accessories include a recipe book, cleaning tools, and specialized blending discs for tasks like chopping, grinding, and pureeing. 


### Can it handle frozen ingredients?

The Vitamix 5200 performs exceptionally well with frozen ingredients, making it ideal for smoothies, soups, and sauces. It can handle up to 16 ounces of frozen fruit or vegetables at once, though blending times may be longer than with fresh ingredients. 

For best results, use the pulse function to start, then let the blender run for 30 seconds to fully engage the blade before adding more frozen ingredients. This prevents the motor from overheating and ensures thorough blending. 


### What about noise levels?

At 88 decibels, the Vitamix 5200 produces a noticeable but manageable noise level. It's comparable to common household appliances like dishwashers and vacuum cleaners. 

During blending, the motor may vibrate slightly due to its powerful performance. For quieter operation, consider blending softer ingredients or using the pulse function in short, controlled bursts. 


### How long does it take to heat liquids?

The Vitamix 5200 can heat liquids efficiently, reaching serving temperature in about 2-3 minutes when using the heat function. For liquids with higher fat content or thicker consistencies, the heating process may take longer. 

For best results, cover the blender container with its lid and use the heat function in 1-minute intervals, watching for the desired temperature to avoid over-heating or scalding.
