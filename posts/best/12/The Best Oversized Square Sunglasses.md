### Frame Material and Construction

### Sleeve Protectors and Storage

Many oversized sunglasses come with protective sleeves to prevent scratches and damage during storage. Consider models that include these features, as they help maintain your glasses' appearance and extend their lifespan. The storage solution should also be convenient for travel and daily use. 


### Lens Options and UV Protection

The lenses should provide adequate UV protection, blocking at least 99% of both UVA and UVB rays. Consider polarized lenses if you spend time outdoors, as they reduce glare and enhance color perception. The tint should match your preferences and the intended use, ranging from clear for indoor activities to dark polarized shades for bright sunlight.

### Adjustability and Fit

Pay attention to how the glasses sit on your face. The temples should hug your ears comfortably without squeezing, while the nose bridge should distribute weight evenly. Check for adjustable features like nose pads and temple tips, which can improve fit and reduce sliding. 


## FAQ

![Oversized-Square-Sunglasses-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Oversized-Square-Sunglasses-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What makes square-shaped sunglasses unique?

Square sunglasses feature geometric frames with sharp, 90-degree angles. This shape is known for its modern, bold appearance and can add a distinctive statement to any face shape. The structured design helps reduce glare and provides excellent coverage, making them practical for various weather conditions. 

Unlike round or oval frames, square sunglasses create a more defined and angular silhouette. They work particularly well with rectangular and diamond face shapes, though their rigid lines might not suit everyone's preferences. 


### How do you properly measure for square sunglasses?

To find the right size, measure your face's widest point between cheekbones. The frame's width should slightly exceed this measurement for comfortable, stylish fit. For a precise measurement, use a ruler or tape measure on your face, then compare it to the frame's width specification. 

Consider the frame's height as well. It should sit just above the cheekbones, covering the lower lashes. The height is measured from the top of the frame to the bottom, including the arms.

### What are the primary benefits of oversized sunglasses?

Oversized sunglasses offer several advantages. Their larger frames provide superior UV protection, with more surface area covering the eyes and surrounding skin. The increased frame size also enhances visual appeal and creates a more dramatic, fashion-forward look. 

These sunglasses excel in various environments, especially bright sunlight or snowy conditions. Their spacious frames allow for easy layering with hats or scarves, adding versatility to your summer wardrobe. 


### Can you wear square sunglasses with prescription lenses?

Yes, square sunglasses can accommodate prescription lenses through several options. Most manufacturers offer dedicated square frames for glasses, allowing the lenses to maintain their shape. If your current frames are square, you may also opt for progressive lenses that maintain the frame's geometric design. 

For more dramatic styles, consider aviator-inspired square frames with built-in lens options. These frames combine the bold square shape with practical lens accommodations, offering both style and functionality.

### How do you maintain the longevity of square sunglasses?

To keep your square sunglasses in top condition, store them in their original case when not in use. This protects the frames from scratches and bending. When cleaning, use a soft cloth dampened with water and mild soap, avoiding harsh chemicals that could damage the frame's finishes. 

Avoid leaving them in direct sunlight or extreme temperatures, as this can warp the frames. Regularly check the temple hinges for wear and replace any damaged parts promptly to prevent further damage to the frame. 


### What styles pair well with square sunglasses?

Square sunglasses complement various fashion choices. They work particularly well with structured clothing like tailored suits, blazers, and crisp white shirts. The bold shape pairs harmoniously with classic patterns like pinstripes and solid colors, creating a polished look. 

For a relaxed vibe, square sunglasses work well with casual outfits like t-shirts, jeans, and sneakers. They add an unexpected twist to everyday wear, making a simple outfit more interesting and fashionable.
