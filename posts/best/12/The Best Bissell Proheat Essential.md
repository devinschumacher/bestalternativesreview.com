## Buyer's Guide

Vacuum cleaners with steam cleaning capabilities offer a more thorough cleaning solution than traditional vacuums, combining suction power with heat to remove deeply embedded dirt and kill germs. The Bissell Proheat Essential series represents this category, providing users with steam cleaning capabilities in a portable vacuum cleaner. 


### Steam Cleaning Functionality

Bissell Proheat Essential vacuums generate steam through an electric heating element that heats water from the cleaning tank. The steam is released through the vacuum's wand or attachments, helping to loosen and remove dirt from carpets and floors. The amount of steam produced can vary between models, so look for a device that delivers sufficient pressure and temperature for effective cleaning.

### Steam and Suction Integration

The best Bissell Proheat Essential models combine steam cleaning with powerful suction to handle both loose debris and moisture. Ensure the vacuum has a high-powered motor and appropriate filtration to prevent allergens from being recirculated into the air. Check that the steam and suction functions can be independently controlled, allowing you to switch between cleaning modes based on the surface you're cleaning. 


### Steam Wand and Attachment Design

The wand and attachments are crucial for accessing hard-to-reach areas and cleaning different surfaces. Look for a versatile system with multiple attachments, including crevice tools and dusting brushes. The steam wand should be long enough to reach corners and under furniture while remaining manageable to operate. Consider models with ergonomic handles and adjustable steam settings for improved comfort during extended use.

When selecting a Bissell Proheat Essential vacuum, consider factors beyond just the cleaning capabilities. Check the weight and balance of the device for easy maneuverability, especially when cleaning large areas. The capacity of the dust collection system and cleaning tank affects how often you need to empty the vacuum, while the length of the power cord impacts its versatility. Additionally, evaluate the ease of cleaning and maintenance for both the vacuum and its attachments to maintain optimal performance.
