## Buyer's Guide

A Graco high chair is a crucial piece of equipment for any parent, providing a safe and comfortable way for babies and toddlers to eat at the table. When selecting a Graco high chair, several key factors will influence your choice, including safety features, compatibility with table surfaces, and portable options for families on the go. Understanding these aspects will help you find the ideal high chair that meets your child's needs and your lifestyle requirements. 


### Safety Features

Safety should be your top priority when choosing a Graco high chair. Look for models with five-point harness systems that keep your child securely seated during feeding. The seat should have adequate head support and be made from durable, easy-to-clean materials. Additionally, ensure the high chair has stable base legs and brake mechanisms to prevent tipping, especially on uneven surfaces. 


### Compatibility with Table Surfaces

Graco high chairs vary in their design for table compatibility. Some models feature wide bases that rest directly on the table, while others include footrests that help prevent tipping. Consider the height and material of your dining table when selecting a model. If you frequently dine out or travel, a high chair with foldable legs or compact design may be more practical than one with fixed legs. 


### Portability and Storage

For families who spend time in different locations, portability is essential. High chairs with foldable frames and detachable seats are more convenient for storage and travel. Look for models with carrying bags or backpack attachments that keep your high chair protected during transport. The weight capacity of the chair should also match your child's size, typically ranging from 22 to 65 pounds for Graco models.
