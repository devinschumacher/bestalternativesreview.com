## FAQ


### What makes the Jetson Electric Bike different from regular bikes?

The Jetson Electric Bike features an all-electric propulsion system that assists your pedaling, extending your range and making hills easier to climb. Unlike traditional bikes, it combines the exercise benefits of cycling with the convenience of electric assistance, ideal for daily commuting or casual fitness rides. 

The bike's motor and battery system work in conjunction with your pedal input, providing adjustable assistance levels through multiple modes. This hybrid approach makes it suitable for both experienced electric bike riders and those new to e-biking, enhancing overall riding experience and accessibility. 


### Can I still pedal normally with the electric assistance?

Yes, the Jetson Electric Bike is designed to work seamlessly with your pedaling. When you pedal, the motor assists your effort, similar to training on a stationary bike with resistance. You can control the level of assistance through different modes, allowing you to maintain a natural pedaling rhythm without relying solely on electric power. 

The bike's system automatically reduces electronic assistance at higher speeds, ensuring a natural transition from pedaling to motorized support. This feature helps develop your riding skills while enjoying the benefits of electric assistance. 


### What kind of terrain and weather conditions is the Jetson Electric Bike suitable for?

The Jetson Electric Bike handles well on paved roads, including city streets, bike paths, and suburban routes. It's particularly beneficial for urban commuting, as it helps manage hills and faster speeds on flat terrain. The bike performs best in dry weather conditions, though it's generally suitable for commuting in light rain. 

While the electric assist system works best on paved surfaces, the bike features capable suspension and tire technology suitable for occasional light off-road riding. The motor and battery system are protected from most weather conditions, making it practical for daily use in moderate climates. 


### How long does it take to charge the battery?

The Jetson Electric Bike's battery typically takes 3-4 hours to fully charge when connected to a standard wall outlet. A 60-minute fast charge provides enough power for 15-20 miles of riding, which is sufficient for most daily commutes and local errands. 

The bike includes a portable battery pack that offers 15 miles of range and can be charged in 80 minutes. This pack is ideal for situations where the main battery needs urgent charging or when extending your ride range becomes necessary. 


### What maintenance does an electric bike require?

Regular maintenance for the Jetson Electric Bike includes checking tire pressure, lubricating the chain, and inspecting brakes. The electric components require less frequent attention; the battery should be charged and discharged properly, and the motor and drivetrain should be occasionally checked for proper function. 

Like any bike, occasional adjustments and cleaning are recommended, especially after riding in muddy or sandy conditions. The electric system's maintenance is simpler than a traditional motorcycle, with most checks focused on battery health and motor performance. 


### What's the maximum speed I can go on an electric bike?

Electric bikes are typically limited to a maximum speed of 28 mph (45 km/h) in the United States, which is the case with the Jetson model. This speed limit ensures road safety while allowing for comfortable, efficient commuting and fitness rides. 

The bike's system automatically caps the assisted speed, preventing excessive velocity that could compromise safety or legal requirements. However, this top speed isn't a limitation for most casual riders, as the motor provides significant assistance up to its maximum speed.
