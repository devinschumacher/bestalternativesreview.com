## Buyer's Guide

Unite shampoo blends powerful cleaning ingredients with natural botanicals to deliver a refreshing scalp experience. Understanding key features and benefits will help you choose the right formula for your hair type and scalp concerns. 


### Core Ingredients

Effective shampoos contain a combination of surfactants for cleansing, moisturizers for nourishment, and actives targeting specific scalp needs. Common active ingredients include tea tree oil for dandruff, niacinamide for scalp health, and biotin for hair strength. The ingredient list should clearly state these beneficial components. 


### Formula Characteristics

Shampoo formulas range from mild to harsh, with varying levels of lather and texture. For sensitive scalps, look for hypoallergenic formulas with fewer irritants. Those with oily scalps may prefer clarifying shampoos, while dry scalps need moisturizing formulas. The consistency and lather intensity can also affect rinse-out and residue. 


### Application and Usage

Proper application technique ensures optimal results. Wet hair thoroughly before applying, using a nickel-sized amount for general use. Lather at the scalp to activate ingredients, then distribute evenly through lengths. The recommended usage frequency depends on hair type: daily for oily, every other day for normal to dry. 


### Environmental Impact

Increasingly, consumers consider sustainability when selecting shampoos. Look for products in recyclable packaging and those made from biodegradable ingredients. Some formulas are available in concentrate form, reducing overall waste through dilution.
