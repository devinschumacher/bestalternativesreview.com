## FAQ


### What is the Crayola Ultimate Light Board?

The Crayola Ultimate Light Board is an interactive coloring product that uses glow-in-the-dark paint and reusable sheets. It features a built-in light that activates the paint, allowing for hours of colorful fun. 

Each set includes glow-in-the-dark sheets, paint pens, and a light board, making it ideal for kids and families looking for a creative night-time activity. 


### How does the glow-in-the-dark feature work?

The glow-in-the-dark paint absorbs light when exposed to regular room or natural light. After the light source disappears, the paint glows for several minutes, creating a lasting visual effect. 

The included light board intensifies the glow, revealing vibrant, illuminated designs that can be enjoyed for longer periods. 


### Are the sheets and paint reusable?

Yes, the sheets are entirely reusable. After each session, simply wipe them clean with a damp cloth to remove any remaining paint. 

The paint pens are also reusable and can be refilled with refills, extending their lifespan and providing consistent quality. 


### How long do the glow effects last?

The glow typically lasts between 5 to 10 minutes after exposure to a light source, though this can vary based on the brightness of the light and environmental factors. 

Once the glow fades, simply expose the sheet to light again to reactivate it, creating a fresh canvas for each use. 


### What age group is this product suitable for?

The Crayola Ultimate Light Board is suitable for children aged 5 and up. It's ideal for birthday parties, sleepovers, or any time you want to add a creative, interactive element to playtime. 

Parents and caregivers will enjoy watching their kids create and play with this engaging, light-based coloring system. 


### How should I care for the light board?

Regularly clean the light board with a soft, dry cloth to remove dust and fingerprints. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials, as they may damage the surface. 

If the light ever stops working, check the batteries and ensure they are properly installed. The light board usually requires standard AAA batteries (not included).
