## Buyer's Guide

Blue pumpkins add a unique twist to traditional Halloween decor, combining the eerie appeal of pumpkins with the striking color of the ocean or sky. When selecting blue pumpkin decorations, consider several key factors to ensure you choose a piece that safely enhances your fall ambiance. 


### Meterology and Size

Measure the space where your blue pumpkin will reside to determine an appropriate size. Consider both the horizontal and vertical dimensions to avoid overwhelming smaller rooms while ensuring a noticeable presence in larger spaces. Common sizes range from 6 inches to over 3 feet in height, with corresponding width measurements. 


### Meterial Quality

Most blue pumpkin decorations are made from foam or plastic. Higher-quality pieces will feature durable, fade-resistant materials that maintain their color and shape over time. Check for sturdy construction with reinforced details where the pumpkin's wall meets the stem and base. 


### Lighting and Visibility

Blue pumpkins can be especially striking when lit from within. Consider decorations with built-in LED lights or those that allow for easy installation of external holiday lights. The illumination should enhance the blue hue without causing glare or discomfort when viewed from various angles. 


### Installation and Display

Think about how you'll securely display your blue pumpkin. Some decorations come with suction cups, hooks, or wall-mounted bases. Consider whether you need additional hardware like brackets or screws for the mounting points. Clear instructions for setup and removal will help maintain the decorative space's cleanliness.
