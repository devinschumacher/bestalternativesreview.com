## FAQ

### What makes Paper Hearts different from regular paper products?

Unlike traditional paper products, Paper Hearts uses a specialized material that combines durability with an elegant matte finish. This unique composition allows for intricate designs and subtle textures that give each piece a premium feel. 

The material is also specially treated to resist fading and wrinkling, ensuring that the details remain crisp and vibrant even after repeated handling or display. 


### How long do Paper Hearts last when displayed on a shelf?

When properly cared for, Paper Hearts can retain their quality for several years if displayed in a dry environment away from direct sunlight. The materials used in their construction are resistant to both fading and physical damage. 

For extended display life, it's recommended to purchase a protective cover or frame where possible, as this provides an additional layer of protection from dust and environmental factors.

### What sizes are available for Paper Hearts?

The most popular sizes range from small decorative pieces measuring 2-3 inches in diameter to medium designs around 4-6 inches. Larger pieces are available but less common. 

Sizes may vary slightly between manufacturers, so it's important to check specific dimensions when placing an order. 


### Are Paper Hearts suitable for outdoor display?

For outdoor celebrations or events, consider purchasing weather-resistant paper products specifically designed for outdoor use to maintain quality and longevity.

### How should I care for Paper Hearts to maintain their appearance?

Regular dusting with a soft cloth and occasional cleaning with a slightly damp cloth can help maintain the appearance of Paper Hearts. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials that might damage the surface. 

Store Paper Hearts flat when not in use to prevent warping. If wall mounting is preferred, select floating frames or clips designed for paper materials to prevent direct pressure on the artwork. 


### What should I consider when selecting a Paper Heart design?

When choosing a design, consider the color palette and visual motifs of your existing décor to ensure the Paper Heart complements your space. Consider also the scale of the room where it will be displayed to avoid pieces that appear too small or large. 

Look for designs with clear, defined details if you plan to display your Paper Heart in well-lit areas, as this will ensure maximum visual impact and legibility of the artwork.
