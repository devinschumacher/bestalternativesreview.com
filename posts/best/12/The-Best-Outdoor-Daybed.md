### Dimensions and Space Considerations

Measure your intended space carefully before purchasing. Daybeds come in various sizes, from compact options suitable for smaller outdoor areas to larger models that can accommodate multiple people.

### How do you maintain an outdoor daybed?

Regular maintenance includes shaking loose debris, checking for structural integrity, and inspecting the cushion fabrics for signs of wear or damage. 

Annual deep cleaning with mild soap and water, followed by a protective sealant, helps maintain the daybed's appearance and extend its lifespan. 


### What is the average lifespan of an outdoor daybed?

With proper care, an outdoor daybed made from quality materials can last between 8-12 years, depending on usage frequency and maintenance. 

Teak frames and aluminum construction tend to outlast PVC models, though all materials degrade over time from exposure to UV rays and weather elements.
