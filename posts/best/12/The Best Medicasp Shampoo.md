## FAQ


### Are Medicasp Shampoos suitable for all skin types?

Medicasp Shampoos are designed to be gentle on most skin types, making them suitable for daily use. However, individuals with sensitive skin may want to perform a patch test first to ensure no adverse reactions occur.

### Can Medicasp Shampoos be used to treat dandruff?

Yes, Medicasp Shampoos contain natural ingredients that help manage dandruff symptoms. The gentle formula effectively removes flakes while nourishing the scalp.
