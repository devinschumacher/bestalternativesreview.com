## Buyer's Guide

A Moft laptop stand is an adjustable stand designed to elevate your laptop, improving ergonomics and offering multiple viewing angles. These stands are particularly useful for transforming your workspace or finding the perfect viewing height while in bed or on the couch. 


### Adjustable Features

### Size Compatibility

Ensure the stand's dimensions match your laptop's size. Most Moft stands are designed for standard laptops (11" to 15" screens), but some may accommodate larger or smaller devices. Check the compatibility specifications to avoid issues with incompatible screen sizes or thicknesses. 


### Material Quality

Stands vary in material construction. Aluminum and steel offers durability and stability, while plastic or injection-molded parts can be lighter but may not support heavier laptops as effectively.
