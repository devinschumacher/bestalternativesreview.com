## FAQ


### What is a Jerry Curl wig?

A Jerry Curl wig is a type of human hair wig designed to mimic the natural curl pattern associated with African American hair. These wigs typically feature tightly curled, springy strands that create a bouncy, natural-looking texture. 

The term "Jerry Curl" comes from the name of former World champion Tony "Jerry" Thompson, who famously wore a perm with similar texture in the 1970s. 


### How do they compare to other types of wigs?

Jerry Curl wigs generally provide more volume and texture compared to straight or sleek styles. They're popular among women who want a natural curly look without the maintenance required for real hair. 

Compared to traditional perms, Jerry Curl wigs offer instant results and a wider range of styling options. However, they may require more frequent reapplication to maintain the curl pattern. 


### What's the typical maintenance needed?

These wigs usually need daily brushing and regular styling to maintain their shape and volume. The tight curls require specific styling products to avoid tangling and maintain the natural look. 

Plan to replace the wig every 6-12 months depending on usage and maintenance. Store the wig properly when not in use to prevent damage and maintain its shape. 


### Are there specific hair types it works best for?

The Jerry Curl pattern works well for African American hair types but can also be styled to look natural on anyone with oily or fine hair. It's less suitable for individuals with dry or damaged hair as it may create excessive frizz. 

A curly or wavy texture in your natural hair can also enhance the look of a Jerry Curl wig, providing a more natural transition between the two. 


### What are the sizing options?

Jerry Curl wigs typically come in a standard size that fits most women with an average head circumference. Some providers offer slight adjustments for tighter or looser curls. 

Men's Jerry Curl wigs are less common but are usually available in a standard size. Specific men's options might include shorter lengths or more defined curl patterns. 


### How do I style a Jerry Curl wig?

To style a Jerry Curl wig, start by securing the ends and gently working the product through the mid-lengths to the ends. Use your fingers to create separation and maintain the curl pattern. 

For more texture, spritz with a sea salt spray and gently scrunch the hair. To tame flyaways, apply a small amount of a lightweight hold product focused on the ends.
