## Buyer's Guide

The Cold Steel Rajah 2 is part of a series of straight-bladed fixed knives renowned for their durability and practical design. These knives are favored by outdoor enthusiasts, collectors, and professionals who value a reliable cutting tool. Understanding the key aspects of the Rajah 2's construction, balance, and performance capabilities will help you determine if it meets your needs. 


### Blade Design and Materials

The blade is typically made from high-carbon stainless steel, chosen for its combination of edge retention and resistance to corrosion. Common blade designs feature a straight, single-edged profile with a slight curve near the tip for easier slicing. The blade's thickness varies along its length, with the spine being slightly thicker for better handling and reduced flex.

### Handle Design and Ergonomics

The handle often employs a three-rivet construction with a crossguard for added finger protection. The use of G10 material provides excellent grip properties, even when wet or greasy. The handle diameter usually ranges between 12mm and 14mm, offering a balance between comfort and control during use. 


### Overall Balance and Weight Distribution

The knife's weight is typically distributed evenly between the blade and handle, resulting in a balanced feel during use. The blade's center of gravity is usually located close to the base, which facilitates precise control during cutting tasks. The overall weight usually ranges between 90-120 grams, providing adequate heft without unnecessary bulk.

### Manufacturing Quality and Attention to Detail

Look for consistent blade geometry, precise rivet placement, and clean machining edges. Quality construction should be free from sharp edges, wobbly rivets, or loose components. The crossguard should sit flush with the blade spine, and the G10 handle should adhere firmly to the tang or bolster for maximum durability.

### What is the Cold Steel Rajah 2?

The Cold Steel Rajah 2 is a fixed-blade folding knife that combines traditional design elements with modern functionality. It's known for its reliable lock-up system and durable construction. 

Each blade is made from high-quality stainless steel, with a unique two-stage closing mechanism that helps prevent accidental deployment. 


### What makes the Rajah 2's locking mechanism different?

The Rajah 2 uses a double-lock system that deploys the primary lock immediately before the blade fully opens, followed by a second lock engagement. This ensures the blade remains locked open while the user works. 

The closing mechanism features a similar two-stage process in reverse, where the primary lock retracts before the blade can close, adding an extra layer of safety during storage.

### Can you describe the handle design?

The handle consists of G10 material with a black oxide finish, offering both grip security and corrosion resistance. The blade sits slightly recessed to prevent snagging and improve pocket carry.

### What are the key technical specifications?

### How durable is the Rajah 2?

The 440C stainless steel blade and G10 handle construction make the Rajah 2 resistant to rust and wear, suitable for outdoor and kitchen use. 

Users have reported excellent blade retention and handle integrity after heavy use, with the double-lock system preventing blade failure under stress. 


### What maintenance requirements are needed?

Regularly clean the blade and handle with mild soap and water, followed by drying. Check the spring and lock mechanisms monthly for proper function. 

Lubricate the pivot point weekly with silicone-based lubricant to prevent corrosion and maintain smooth operation. Store the knife dry and sharpener regularly to maintain edge quality.
