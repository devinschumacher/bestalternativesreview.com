## Buyer's Guide

The Nectar Queen mattress combines comfort and support in a unique hybrid design, offering both memory foam and innerspring elements. This mattress utilizes a layer of cooling gel memory foam to enhance temperature regulation, making it suitable for various sleep positions and body types. 


### Hybrid Construction

As a hybrid mattress, the Nectar Queen features an innerspring core with memory foam layers. The innerspring provides excellent motion isolation and breathability, while the memory foam promotes sinkage and pressure relief. This combination typically offers superior support compared to traditional memory foam mattresses, making it suitable for all sleep positions.

### Cooling Technology

The cooling gel memory foam layer helps dissipate heat during the night, maintaining optimal sleep temperatures. This feature is particularly beneficial for individuals who tend to sleep hot or live in warmer climates. The gel particles enhance airflow through phase-change properties, which can help reduce nighttime overheating. 


### Edge Support and Durability

Edge support has improved significantly in modern hybrid mattresses, and the Nectar Queen performs well in this area. The foam construction around the edges provides consistent support for seated activities and prevents the feeling of 'bottoming out. ' This durability helps maintain consistent pressure relief throughout the lifespan of the mattress, typically 7-10 years for properly used queen-sized models.

### Pressure Relief and Body Support

The varying firmness levels from the innerspring core to the memory foam layers cater to different sleep positions. Side sleepers may prefer the pressure relief offered by the memory foam, while back and stomach sleepers might appreciate the additional support from the innerspring. The transition between materials provides a balanced feel for most body types, though individual preferences for firmness may vary.
