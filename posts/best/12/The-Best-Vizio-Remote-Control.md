## Buyer's Guide

When it comes to controlling your Vizio TV or soundbar, having the right remote control can make all the difference. Whether you're a tech-savvy enthusiast or just want a reliable way to manage your entertainment setup, understanding the key features and considerations for Vizio remotes will help you choose the right one for your needs. 


### Standard vs. Enhanced Features

Vizio remotes typically come with basic functions like power, volume control, and channel switching. Enhanced models offer additional features such as voice commands, app controls, and scene presets for home theater modes. Consider whether you need these advanced capabilities or prefer a more straightforward design. 

![Vizio-Remote-Control-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Vizio-Remote-Control-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Connectivity Options

Modern Vizio remotes use different technologies for connectivity. Infrared (IR) is the standard for controlling TVs and older devices. Some newer models support Bluetooth for features like app controls and voice assistants. Think about which devices in your setup support each technology before choosing a remote type. 


### Size and Ergonomics

The physical size of a remote affects both usability and convenience. Consider the shape and layout of the buttons - well-placed controls for common functions can significantly improve your experience. The remote's dimensions should allow comfortable operation while sitting or lying down. 

![Vizio-Remote-Control-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Vizio-Remote-Control-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Power and Durability

Battery life is crucial for remotes that use power instead of IR. Look for models with efficient power consumption and long-lasting batteries. For premium features like voice control or app integration, consider remotes that support both USB charging and battery backup to prevent unexpected power loss. 


## FAQ

![Vizio-Remote-Control-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Vizio-Remote-Control-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What features do Vizio remote controls typically have?

Vizio remote controls often include standard features like volume control, channel up/down, and power buttons. Many also feature specific buttons for accessing Vizio's Smart TV functions, such as app launcher, home, and back. 

The most contemporary Vizio remotes come with advanced features like voice commands, gesture control, and customizable buttons for frequently used functions. Some models even include built-in LED screens for displaying channel information or quick settings. 


### How do I find the right size remote for my Vizio TV?

Vizio offers several sizes of remote controls to fit different viewing distances and setups. Their standard models measure around 8.5 inches from tip to base, while extended-range models add approximately 2 inches in length. Wall-mounted remotes are specifically designed for touchscreen devices and have smaller controls. 

To determine which size is best for your setup, measure the distance from your viewing position to your TV and choose a remote that allows comfortable reach while seated. 

![Vizio-Remote-Control-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Vizio-Remote-Control-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can Vizio remote controls work with non-Vizio devices?

Most Vizio remote controls are designed to work with Vizio devices specifically, including their own Smart TVs, soundbars, and streaming devices. However, their basic infrared functionalities can sometimes control other compatible devices if your remote has the appropriate button configuration. 

For compatibility with other brands, consider purchasing a universal remote that supports Vizio's protocols or investing in a third-party app for your smartphone or tablet that can mimic remote functions. 


### What should I consider when replacing a Vizio remote control?

When replacing a Vizio remote, ensure it matches the wireless frequency protocol of your TV and other devices, typically 2.4GHz. Check for any unique controls or features specific to your TV model, such as button layout or app launcher functionality. 

Consider the remote's build quality, battery life (LIR2032 or CR2032 coin cell batteries are common), and any additional features like backlit buttons or extended range capabilities. If you frequently use specific apps or functions, look for remotes with dedicated buttons for those features. 

![Vizio-Remote-Control-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Vizio-Remote-Control-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do Vizio remotes connect to smart devices?

Vizio remotes can connect to smart devices via their app, which allows pairing via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. The app supports features like voice control setup, app shortcut creation, and remote device control through your TV's interface. 

For directly controlling compatible smart devices, check if your Vizio remote has dedicated buttons or if the app allows adding external device controls. Some advanced remotes have built-in support for specific smart home devices through partnerships with manufacturers. 


### How long do Vizio remote controls last?

Vizio remote controls typically offer around 3-5 years of battery life with regular use. However, daily heavy usage or frequent app pairing may reduce this lifespan. 

The most common issue with Vizio remotes is battery failure, but other potential problems include button sticking, signal interference, or malfunctioning internal components. If your remote fails after a year of regular use, consider warranty or replacement options.
