## Buyer's Guide

Duck puppets combine simple mechanics with expressive potential, making them a versatile choice for performances and interactive play. Understanding their key features helps in selecting one that matches your needs for size, mobility, and customization. 


### Size and Proportion

Size impacts performance dynamics - smaller puppets suit intimate settings or detailed scenes, while larger ones are ideal for open spaces or performances with multiple characters. Pay attention to the puppet's height and width compared to human performers or available stage space.

### Mechanics and Mobility

Basic duck puppets use simple rods or strings for movement, suitable for basic mouth and head gestures. Consider puppets with pivot points for more natural head rotation or those with finger loops for enhanced control. Advanced mechanisms might include weight vests for grounded performances or telescoping rods for adjustable height. 


### Material and Construction

Traditional duck puppets use lightweight foam, cardboard, or plastic with fabric wings. For more durable options, look for puppets made from reinforced materials like PVC or metal frameworks. The construction should balance weight with maneuverability, especially for extended performances.

### Customization and Accessories

Basic duck puppets come with standard yellow feathers and beaks, but consider puppets that allow for color changes or interchangeable parts. Additional accessories like feather boas, rubber duck hats, or floatation devices can extend play value and create themed performances.
