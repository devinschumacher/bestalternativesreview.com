Published in 1997 by The University of Chicago Press, this hardcover book examines how the story of Cain and Abel has influenced notions of collective identity throughout history. Through careful analysis of biblical narratives, author James Schwartz argues that the concept of monotheism has fostered exclusionary thinking, shaping political and social structures through a lens of "us vs. them" mentality. The Hebrew Bible's emphasis on division and competition, amplified by Western religious traditions, has contributed to deeply ingrained assumptions about group identity that Schwartz contends are both misguided and dangerous.

## Buyer's Guide

Cains Jawbone Books offer a unique blend of functionality and design, making them a popular choice for both casual readers and avid collectors. These books feature distinctive jaw-shaped covers that not only serve as an artistic statement but also provide practical benefits like improved grip and reduced hand fatigue during reading sessions. 


### Material Quality and Construction

The durability of a Cains Jawbone Book depends heavily on its material quality. Premium options featuring genuine leather coverings typically offer superior resistance to wear and tear compared to their cheaper counterparts made from synthetic materials. The spine's flexibility and the book's overall weight distribution significantly impact its longevity and comfort during use. 


### Size and Portability

While the distinctive jaw shape adds character, it can affect the book's portability. Smaller sizes tend to be more comfortable for on-the-go reading but may feel too compact for extended sessions.
