## FAQ

![Leche-Nido-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Leche-Nido-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is Leche Nido?

Leche Nido is a fortified milk brand that originated in Chile and has since expanded globally. The product is known for its blend of natural milk and added nutrients, including DHA and lutein, which are claimed to support brain and eye development. 

The brand offers a variety of milk products, including whole milk, low-fat milk, and milk alternatives. Additionally, they produce specialized formulas for different age groups and dietary needs. 


### What nutrients are added to Leche Nido?

Leche Nido milk products typically contain added nutrients such as DHA, lutein, and vitamins A, C, and D. These components are often reinforced through fortification processes to provide additional nutritional benefits beyond natural milk content. 

The brand also offers specialized formulas with different nutrient profiles. For example, growing-up milk formulas may include extra iron and zinc, while lactose-free options contain added enzymes to break down lactose naturally. 

![Leche-Nido-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Leche-Nido-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is the difference between Leche Nido milk and regular milk?

Leche Nido milk undergoes additional processing to fortify it with specific nutrients like DHA and lutein, which are not naturally present in regular milk. These fortified nutrients are designed to support brain and eye development in children and young adults. 

The brand's milk products also differ in their fat content and suitability for various dietary needs. Whole milk versions contain more natural fats, while low-fat options offer reduced calorie alternatives. Specialized formulas are available for lactose intolerance and other dietary requirements. 


### How do Leche Nido products compare to similar fortified milk brands?

Leche Nido competes with other fortified milk brands that offer similar nutritional enhancements through their processing methods. However, comparison between brands often depends on specific product formulations and targeted age groups. 

While many fortified milk products focus on nutrient reinforcement, Leche Nido's product line is particularly noted for its emphasis on DHA and lutein content, which are associated with brain and eye health. 

![Leche-Nido-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Leche-Nido-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Are Leche Nido products suitable for all age groups?

Leche Nido offers a range of products suitable for different age groups. Their growing-up formulas are designed for children and young adults, while other options cater to lactose intolerance and general nutritional support. 

It's important to note that while fortified milk products provide additional nutrition, they should complement rather than replace balanced dietary choices appropriate for each age group. 


### What is the shelf life of Leche Nido products?

Leche Nido products generally have a shelf life of 6 to 12 months from production, depending on the specific product type and packaging. Whole milk and standard milk products tend to have shorter shelf lives than fortified versions. 

After opening, the recommended storage period is typically 2-3 weeks for both whole and low-fat milk products, though this can vary by specific product and packaging type.
