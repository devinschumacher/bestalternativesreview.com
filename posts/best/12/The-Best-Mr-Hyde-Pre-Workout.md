## FAQ


### What is Mr Hyde Pre Workout?

Mr Hyde Pre Workout is a performance enhancement supplement designed to improve workout intensity, focus, and endurance. It combines various ingredients aimed at boosting energy levels, increasing muscle pumps, and supporting overall athletic performance. 

The formula typically includes stimulants like caffeine and beta-alanine for increased alertness and delayed fatigue, along with nitric oxide precursors such as citrulline to enhance blood flow and muscle size. 


### How long does it take to feel the effects?

Most users report noticeable effects within 15-30 minutes after consumption. The boost in energy and focus typically lasts for 3-4 hours, depending on the specific blend and individual tolerance to stimulants. 

The muscular pump often becomes apparent during workouts, usually starting around 20-30 minutes after taking the supplement. 


### How much should I take?

The recommended serving size is usually 1 scoop (typically 25-30 grams), mixed with 8-10 ounces of water. This serves as a general guideline, and the optimal dosage may vary based on body weight, caffeine sensitivity, and specific goals. 

Some formulas may contain different strengths or ingredients, so it's important to follow the specific instructions provided on the product label. 


### Are there any potential side effects?

Common side effects include jitteriness, increased heart rate, and mild gastrointestinal discomfort. These typically affect individuals sensitive to caffeine or stimulants. 

Rare side effects can include severe headache, nausea, or allergic reactions. If you experience any unusual symptoms, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional. 


### How long is it effective?

The pre-workout supplement provides immediate effects during workouts, lasting approximately 3-4 hours. The duration of effectiveness varies based on individual factors and the specific formulation. 

For sustained energy and performance improvements, it's recommended to consume the supplement about 30-60 minutes before exercise. 


### Can I take it every day?

While the supplement can be taken daily, it's advisable to cycle it for optimal results and prevent tolerance. Some users find that alternating usage with rest days or using it only before intense workouts works best for their individual needs and recovery. 

Always listen to your body and adjust your usage based on how you feel. If you experience prolonged side effects or reduced effectiveness, consider taking days off or reducing frequency.
