### What makes a shower curtain boho?

Boho shower curtains blend bohemian elements like earthy textures, natural materials, and vibrant patterns. Handwoven fabrics, macramé details, and rich colors define this style, creating an eclectic and free-spirited bathroom look. 

To complement this aesthetic, boho curtains often feature fringe, tassels, or ornate embroidery, elevating basic functionality with textural interest and artistic flair. 


### How do you measure for a boho shower curtain?

Measure your shower door's height and width, adding 4-6 inches to each measurement for proper overlap and hanging clearance. Consider the curtain's style: longer curtains need more length, while panel curtains may need additional horizontal space. 

Account for rod length and track depth when calculating total curtain size, as standard measurements can vary by manufacturer. Following these guidelines ensures an ideal fit that maximizes the curtain's intended visual impact.

### What materials are commonly used in boho shower curtains?

Traditionally made from cotton, linen, or cotton blends, boho shower curtains now feature innovative water-resistant linens and eco-friendly options like recycled polyester. Textured jacquard weaves and seersucker materials add visual interest while maintaining functionality. 

Artisanal touches like hand-dyed cotton, macramé fringe, and embroidered panels showcase traditional craftsmanship while preserving durability through modern manufacturing techniques. 


### How do you maintain boho shower curtains?

Most boho shower curtains are machine washable, typically requiring a gentle cycle with cold water. For natural materials like cotton or linen, avoid using bleach or harsh detergents, which can damage the fibers and fade colors. 

Always check the care instructions specific to your curtain's material and printing method. Regularly vacuum or shake out dust and debris, reshape panels to maintain their intended style, and repair any loose tassels or damaged edges promptly.

Standard shower curtain sizes range from 67-83 inches in width and 72-95 inches in height, providing ample coverage and proper overlap. For larger shower stalls or traditional panel designs, consider curtains measuring 91-108 inches in width. 

Panel curtains allow for greater customization through number and size, with each panel typically measuring 23-32 inches in width for a traditional look. Understanding your bathroom's dimensions helps select the right proportions for your space.
