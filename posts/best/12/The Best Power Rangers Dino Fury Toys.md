### Power Source and Functionality

### Mobile App Integration

The base station connects to a compatible smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth, allowing kids to unlock special abilities and customize their characters. While this adds to the play experience, ensure your device meets the system requirements before purchasing. Some apps offer additional content through in-app purchases. 


### Figure and Base Quality

Check the material used for the figures - many are plastic with paint coatings. Higher-end versions may feature articulation points for more dynamic posing. The base station should be sturdy enough to support the weight of the figures while they transform and activate. Look for clear instructions on assembly and use.
