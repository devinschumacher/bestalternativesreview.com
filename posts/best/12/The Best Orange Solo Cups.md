## Buyer's Guide

Orange Solo cups are popular for their practicality and durability when serving single servings. These disposable cups are lightweight and stackable, making them ideal for parties, tailgating, or camping trips. Understanding their key features will help you choose the right cups for your needs. 


### Capacity and Design

Standard Orange Solo cups hold 9 ounces, though some variations offer 11 or 12 ounces. The distinctive conical shape helps prevent spills and keeps the cup stable during transport. Consider whether you need additional capacity for hot drinks or iced coffee.
