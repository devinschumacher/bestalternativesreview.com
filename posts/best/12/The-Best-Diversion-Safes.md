## Buyer's Guide

Diversion safes, also known as fake safes, combine robust security with the ability to mislead potential intruders. These safes protect valuable items while their outward appearance disguises their actual purpose. 


### Materials and Construction

Most diversion safes feature a solid wood or particle board exterior, painted to resemble everyday objects like furniture or wall panels. The secure compartment uses reinforced steel or high-density foam material resistant to forced entry and drilling. 


### Size and Design Options

Diversion safes come in various sizes to match standard room dimensions. Compact models fit under tables or dressers, while larger units can replace existing furniture pieces. Some designs include compartments for different valuables, like jewelry or documents. 


### Security Features

These safes typically incorporate multiple locking mechanisms, including conventional padlocks, combination locks, and tamper-evident seals. Some advanced models include hidden emergency access points or biometric locks for enhanced security. 


### Misdirection Techniques

Quality diversion safes use subtle visual and auditory cues to mislead intruders. This may include fake serial numbers, dummy alarms, or sound-emitting devices. The safe's location within a room should be chosen to maximize confusion about its actual position. 


## FAQ


### What is a diversion safe?

A diversion safe is a security solution that combines a traditional vault safe's protection with psychological deception through visual and physical design elements. These safes appear to be regular storage units, furniture pieces, or decorative elements, while concealing a robust security safe within. 

By integrating seamlessly into home or office décor, diversion safes deter potential thieves through visual misdirection, providing an extra layer of security beyond their physical protection features. 


### How do diversion safes compare to traditional vault safes?

Diversion safes offer several key advantages over traditional vault safes. They provide superior concealment, blending seamlessly into any environment. Additionally, their smaller size allows for placement in various locations, including offices and living spaces where larger safes would be impractical. 

While traditional vault safes excel in raw security, diversion safes combine this with psychological deterrence. However, it's important to note that both types offer excellent protection for valuable items. 


### What materials are used in diversion safe construction?

High-quality diversion safes typically feature thick steel walls, often combined with hardened steel plates for critical sections. Many models incorporate additional layers of protection such as bullet-resistant glass and reinforced doors. 

Internal components include robust locking mechanisms, including dual-cylinder deadbolts and internal latches. Some advanced models also feature fire-resistant coatings and specialized door sealing systems. 


### What are the typical capacities of diversion safes?

Diversion safes range in capacity from small units holding a few items to larger models that can store significant amounts of valuables. Most common sizes accommodate jewelry, documents, small electronics, and cash. 

While exact capacities vary by model, typical capacities range from 10-50 cubic inches for personal safes to several hundred cubic inches for larger models. It's important to measure your items before selecting a model. 


### How do I choose the right lock for a diversion safe?

The appropriate lock type depends on your specific needs. Standard combination locks offer convenience but are more vulnerable to code guessing. Digital locks provide enhanced security with fewer physical copies and more complex codes. Some advanced models include biometric options like fingerprint readers. 

Consider factors such as code length, changeability, and resistance to forced entry when selecting a lock type. Many safes allow upgrading locks to higher security levels without major modifications. 


### Are diversion safes suitable for home or business use?

Diversion safes are appropriate for both residential and commercial applications where items of moderate value need protection. They work especially well in environments where visibility of security equipment might attract attention, such as offices, stores, and homes. 

While they excel at protecting against opportunistic theft and forced entry, they may not be suitable for the highest security requirements. Always evaluate your specific security needs before selecting a safe type and size.
