## Buyer's Guide

Milwaukee hand trucks are designed to efficiently transport tools and equipment between work sites. These trucks feature durable construction and practical features that enhance payload capacity and maneuverability. 


### Capacity and Size

Most Milwaukee hand trucks range from 200 to 400 pounds of capacity. Consider the maximum weight you need to transport and choose a truck that exceeds this by 20-30%. Compact models are ideal for tight spaces, while larger trucks provide more storage space. 


### Frame and Wheel Design

The frame should be made from durable materials like steel for lasting performance. Wheels typically come in two sizes: 4" and 5". Smaller wheels are easier to maneuver in tight spaces, while larger wheels provide better load distribution and reduce ground pressure. 


### Handle and Grip Features

Look for trucks with padded, ergonomic handles that reduce strain during extended use. Some models incorporate adjustable or contoured grips to accommodate different hand sizes. The handle height should allow comfortable reaching without excessive bending. 


### Suspension and Load Distribution

Quality hand trucks feature suspension systems to absorb impact during transport. Single-axle trucks with leaf springs or rubber bumpers provide basic shock absorption, while dual-axle models with independent suspension offer smoother rides. 


## FAQ


### What is the weight capacity of Milwaukee hand trucks?

Milwaukee hand trucks typically feature weight capacities ranging from 100 to 300 pounds, depending on the model. The lighter-duty models are suitable for transporting smaller loads, while the heavier-duty options are designed for moving substantial quantities of material. 

When selecting a hand truck, consider the weight of the items you'll be moving most frequently. The weight capacity should comfortably handle your heaviest loads while leaving some reserve capacity for additional weight. 


### How do Milwaukee hand trucks compare in terms of durability?

Milwaukee's hand trucks are built to last, featuring heavy-duty steel construction and reinforced frames. The trucks with fully enclosed decks and ribbed steel sides provide superior load retention and resistance to denting and damage. 

The durability differences between models are most noticeable in the quality of materials used for the deck and wheels. Enclosed deck designs tend to be more resistant to damage from dropped objects, while ribbed steel sides offer improved load security during transport. 


### What accessories are commonly available for Milwaukee hand trucks?

Milwaukee hand trucks frequently come with accessories such as swivel casters, safety chain connections, and load bars. Optional extras include telescoping handles, locking mechanisms, and additional wheel sets for customization. 

Most trucks support standard wheel replacement and handle adjustments, allowing owners to maintain or upgrade their equipment as needed. Accessory compatibility can vary by model, so it's important to verify compatibility when purchasing additional parts. 


### How much clearance do Milwaukee hand trucks need for turning?

The turning radius of Milwaukee hand trucks typically measures between 22 and 26 inches, depending on the model. Narrower trucks with 22-inch turning radii are moremaneuverable for tight spaces, while wider trucks with 26-inch radii provide more stability during transport. 

When selecting a truck based on turning requirements, consider both the workspace dimensions and the weight of the load. Heavier loads may benefit from trucks with larger turning radii for better stability during sharp turns. 


### What type of maintenance do Milwaukee hand trucks require?

Regular maintenance for Milwaukee hand trucks includes checking and adjusting wheel alignment, lubricating moving parts, and inspecting the deck for wear. The trucks should be cleaned after each use to remove dirt and debris. 

Periodic inspections of the frame, wheels, and deck are recommended to identify any signs of wear or damage. Proper maintenance helps extend the life of the truck and ensures safe, reliable operation. 


### Are Milwaukee hand trucks compatible with accessories from other brands?

Milwaukee hand trucks generally use standard wheel and handle components, making them compatible with parts from other manufacturers. However, compatibility can vary based on specific model features. 

When combining accessories from different manufacturers, ensure that the replacement parts match the original dimensions and mounting points. Milwaukee recommends using Genuine Milwaukee Parts for optimal performance and support warranty coverage.
