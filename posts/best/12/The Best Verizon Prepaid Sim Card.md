For example, a $10 refill might add 200 minutes and 200 texts to your account, with some plans allowing up to 13 refills per month. 


### What should I do if my Verizon Prepaid Sim Card stops working?

If your SIM card stops working, first check if your balance is still active and if any services are suspended. You can check your account status online or by calling Verizon customer support. 

If the issue persists, you may need to deactivate and reactivate your service, which can often resolve connectivity problems. For persistent issues, consider visiting a Verizon retail store or customer service center for assistance.
