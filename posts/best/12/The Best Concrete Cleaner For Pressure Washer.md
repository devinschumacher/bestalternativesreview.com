## Buyer's Guide

Concrete cleaning requires the right pressure washer and the proper cleaning solution to achieve professional results. Understanding the key features and considerations for concrete cleaners will help you select the right equipment for your cleaning needs. 


### Pressure Washer Characteristics

The pressure washer's displacement volume and working pressure determine its cleaning effectiveness. Displacement volume (measured in gallons per minute or liters per minute) affects the amount of water available for cleaning, while working pressure (expressed in pounds per square inch or bar) determines the power of the water stream. For concrete cleaning, a displacement volume of 1.8 GPM or higher and working pressure between 3,000 to 4,000 PSI is ideal. 


### Concrete Cleaner Formulations

Concrete cleaners come in various formulations, each designed for specific types of pollution. Common types include acid cleaners for removing lime-based stains, degreasing cleaners for oil and grease removal, and eco-friendly cleaners for sensitive applications. Understand the chemical composition of each cleaner as using the wrong product can damage the concrete surface or leave residue. 


### Application Methods

Concrete cleaning solutions are applied to the surface through two primary methods: spray application and immersion. Spray application allows targeted treatment of specific areas, while immersion requires the concrete surface to be submerged in a tub of cleaning solution. Consider the cleaning area's size and the type of pollution when selecting an application method. 


### Environmental and Safety Considerations

Proper disposal of cleaning wastewater and residue is crucial for environmental protection. Check local regulations regarding wastewater disposal methods. Also, ensure the cleaner meets safety standards for handling and application. Gloves, protective eyewear, and respiratory protection may be necessary depending on the cleaner's formulation and application method.
