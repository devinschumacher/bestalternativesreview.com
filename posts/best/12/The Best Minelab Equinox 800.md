## FAQ


### What's the Minelab Equinox 800?

The Minelab Equinox 800 is a handheld metal detector designed for both new and experienced users. It features a versatile VDL (Very Deep LSearch) technology for detecting metal objects at deeper depths, with a 11-inch by 12-inch circular search coil for good ground coverage. 

Key features include 24 frequency bands for tuning to different ground conditions, a built-in LED display for easy reading in various lighting conditions, and Minelab's patented Trudepth technology to help locate object depth and size. 


### What types of metal can it detect?

The Equinox 800 uses Minelab's VDL technology to detect all types of metals, including gold, silver, iron, aluminum, and copper. The unit's wide frequency range allows it to distinguish between different metal types in various ground conditions. 

Its TruVFM mode helps identify iron sources, while DeepVFM mode excels at locating deep, conductive targets. The detector provides different audio tones for different metal types, helping users identify finds more easily. 


### How deep can it detect objects?

Depth detection varies based on metal type and size, but the Equinox 800 typically finds metal objects around 18 inches deep in general metal detecting conditions. This includes both conductive and non-conductive metals found in typical hunting grounds. 

For the most challenging conditions, like heavily mineralized soil or overlapping targets, the DeepVFM mode allows deeper penetrating power, though exact depths depend on environmental factors. 


### What's the search coil size and shape?

The Equinox 800 comes with a standard 12-inch diameter search coil, which is circular in shape. The coil's size and shape provide a balance between target identification and ground coverage, allowing for detailed searches in various terrains. 

The circular design minimizes eddy currents that can mute signals from overlapping targets, while the 12-inch diameter gives enough coverage for efficient searching. Additional coils are available in the 11-inch and 15-inch sizes for different detection needs. 


### What's the battery life like?

The Equinox 800 requires 4 AA alkaline batteries, providing around 12 hours of continuous use on a single set. When running on rechargeable batteries, expect approximately 10 hours of operation. 

To extend battery life, the unit automatically enters sleep mode when the screen is not in use. Users can also adjust sensitivity settings to balance between detection range and power consumption. 


### What's included in the standard kit?

The standard Minelab Equinox 800 kit includes the detector, 12-inch search coil, carry pouch, and 4 AA alkaline batteries. The detector also comes with a comprehensive manual and USB charging cable for the internal lithium-ion battery. 

In addition to the standard kit, users can purchase accessory kits that include extra search coils, ground balance kits, and extended-length extension cables to adapt the detector for various hunting environments.
