## Buyer's Guide

Outdoor footstools provide a convenient place to rest your feet while enjoying the great outdoors. These practical additions to your patio or deck come with various features and considerations that can affect their durability and comfort. This guide helps you select the right outdoor footstool for your space. 


### Materials and Durability

Steel offers the greatest strength but requires regular maintenance. Aluminum is lightweight and corrosion-resistant. Weather-resistant plastic combines durability with easy cleaning.

### Size and Comfort

Select a footstool with a seat width that matches your foot size, typically ranging from 12 to 18 inches. The height should allow your feet to rest comfortably at a 90-degree angle. Consider cushioned seats for extended outdoor use, with densities between 1.8 and 2.5 pounds per cubic foot for adequate support. 


### Stability and Design

Stability is crucial for outdoor footstools, especially during windy conditions. Look for wide bases, secure joints, and weighted bottoms. The design should prevent tipping while allowing easy movement. Consider stools with built-in footrest plates for added stability and proper foot positioning.

### What are the main benefits of using an outdoor footstool?

Outdoor footstools enhance comfort during outdoor seating by providing a raised surface for feet, reducing leg fatigue during extended periods of sitting. This elevated position helps maintain proper posture and blood circulation. 

They also take up minimal space, making them ideal for small outdoor areas, patios, or balconies. Additionally, footstools can double as storage when not in use, helping to keep spaces organized. 


### What materials are commonly used in outdoor footstools?

The most durable materials for outdoor footstools are weather-resistant fabrics, powder-coated steel, aluminum, and solid-wood construction. These materials resist fading, corrosion, and splintering due to sun and rain exposure. 

Some styles incorporate woven resin wicker or weatherproof synthetic materials that mimic traditional rattan, offering a balance of aesthetics and functionality for outdoor settings.

### How should I clean an outdoor footstool?

Mild soap and water solutions are effective for regular cleaning. For weather-resistant fabrics, use a hose or pressure washer to remove debris before applying cleaner. Allow the footstool to fully dry in the sun before storage. 

Avoid harsh chemicals, abrasive cleaners, and excessive water, especially on metal components, as they can damage the finish and promote rusting. Regular cleaning prevents the buildup of dirt and mold, maintaining the footstool's appearance and longevity. 


### What size considerations are important when selecting an outdoor footstool?

Standard outdoor footstools range from 12-24 inches in height, with smaller options ideal for compact spaces and larger ones suitable for higher seating or more casual outdoor areas. Consider the height of your existing furniture when positioning the footstool. 

Width typically varies from 12-18 inches, with wider options providing more stability but taking up more space. Ensure the footstool's dimensions match your outdoor seating arrangement for both functionality and aesthetics.

### Are outdoor footstools suitable for all weather conditions?

Most outdoor footstools are designed to withstand a wide range of weather conditions, including moderate rain, sun exposure, and temperature fluctuations. However, extreme weather events like hurricanes or heavy snowfall may damage footstools, particularly those with loose fabrics or complex designs. 

Check the manufacturer's specifications for temperature and moisture tolerance limits. While generally robust, some materials may swell or warp in consistently high humidity, so store the footstool indoors during particularly harsh weather conditions. 


### How do I store an outdoor footstool when not in use?

Most outdoor footstools can be stored indoors during periods of non-use or harsh weather conditions. To prevent damage, place the footstool in a dry area away from direct sunlight and high temperatures. If the footstool has a fabric cover, remove it and store the frame separately to avoid creasing. 

For extended storage, consider protective covers made of water-resistant materials to shield the footstool from dust and potential water damage. Properly stored footstools can maintain their shape and appearance for seasons of use.
