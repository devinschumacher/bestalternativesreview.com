## FAQ

![Under-Counter-Lighting-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Under-Counter-Lighting-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is under counter lighting?

Under counter lighting, also known as task lighting, illuminates specific areas beneath kitchen countertops, bathroom vanities, and other surfaces. These fixtures are typically recessed or mounted directly under the edge of the countertop, providing focused illumination for cooking, food preparation, and vanity tasks. 

The most common types include LED strips, recessed cans, and track lighting. These fixtures are available in various styles and finishes to match different decor preferences and functional needs. 


### How much light do under counter fixtures produce?

Under counter fixtures vary significantly in output. LED strips typically range from 10 to 30 lumens per foot, while recessed cans and track lighting frequently provide 50-100 watts or more. Most fixtures offer adjustable brightness through dimmer switches, allowing you to customize the lighting level based on your needs and the time of day. 

The total light output depends on the number of fixtures installed and their placement. A general rule of thumb is to install 1-2 under counter fixtures per linear foot of counter space, though this can vary based on room size, ceiling height, and existing ambient lighting. 

![Under-Counter-Lighting-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Under-Counter-Lighting-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is the typical installation process?

Installation typically requires basic electrical knowledge and tools. The process usually involves removing a section of the countertop to access the underside, installing the electrical components, running wires through a conduit or existing hole, and mounting the fixtures. Many modern fixtures come with pre-wired kits to simplify the process. 

For most homeowners, installation is best handled by a professional electrician to ensure proper wiring and compliance with local electrical codes. DIY installation can be attempted with careful planning and adherence to safety guidelines. 


### What are the main benefits?

Under counter lighting enhances functionality by providing direct illumination for specific tasks, reducing eye strain during food preparation and grooming. The fixtures typically consume less energy than general room lighting while offering brighter, more focused illumination. 

The sleek, flush-mount design maximizes counter space and provides an organized look, perfect for modern kitchen and bathroom renovations. LED technology also offers improved longevity and reduced maintenance compared to traditional lighting sources. 

![Under-Counter-Lighting-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Under-Counter-Lighting-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What maintenance is required?

LED under counter fixtures generally require minimal maintenance. The primary care involves occasional dusting with a dry cloth or compressed air to prevent dust accumulation that could affect light output. LED strips should not be unplugged frequently as this can shorten their lifespan. 

Regularly check and tighten any loose connections to ensure proper electrical function. The fixtures typically have a lifespan of 50,000-100,000 hours, though replacement bulbs (if applicable) and wiring may need periodic replacement. 


### What factors affect pricing?

Under counter lighting pricing varies based on several factors: fixture type (LED strips, recessed cans, track lighting), length or size, brand quality, color temperature, and installation complexity. Professional installation typically adds to the cost, with DIY kits offering significant savings. 

Energy-efficient LED fixtures generally cost more upfront than traditional options but offer lower operating costs and longer lifespans. Consider the total cost of ownership (installation, energy consumption, potential replacement costs) when comparing pricing options.
