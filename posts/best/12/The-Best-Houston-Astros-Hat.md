## FAQ


### What makes a Houston Astros hat unique?

Houston Astros hats feature the team's distinctive design elements, including the iconic Texas longhorn logo and the team colors of royal blue and maroon. Premium hats may include additional details like embroidered logos, team patches, and authentic uniforms. 

The quality of materials and construction varies between hat types. Official caps from the MLB Authentic Hat Collection are made from high-quality cotton twill, while team store hats may use more basic construction techniques. 


### Are all Houston Astros hats officially licensed?

All MLB-licensed Houston Astros hats feature the MLB logo and the team's official licensing number embroidered on the crown, ensuring they are genuine merchandise. 

Some third-party hat manufacturers may produce unofficial versions, so look for the MLB logo and licensing number to confirm authenticity. 


### How do I find my hat size?

Hats typically come in standard sizes: small (5 3/8"), medium (5 7/8"), large (6 1/8"), and extra-large (6 5/8"). The sizing chart on the hat's packaging or website page will match these sizes to specific head measurements. 

If you're unsure, measure your head around the middle of your forehead, where you'd normally wear a hat. Most hats have a 1-inch band around the circumference that allows for adjustment, so you can usually find a comfortable fit within your size range. 


### What's the difference between unstructured and structured hats?

Unstructured hats like trucker hats have soft, bendable brims that maintain their shape when folded. These hats typically have shorter brims and softer curves in the crown. 

Structured hats like visors have stiffer brims that maintain their shape, and the crown is more defined with sharper lines and angles. These hats often provide better sun protection due to their straight brim design. 


### How do I care for my Houston Astros hat?

Clean your hat regularly by brushing away dirt with a hat brush or rag. For more stubborn stains, gently hand wash with mild soap and water, then air dry away from direct heat sources like sunlight or radiators. 

Avoid placing your hat in the dryer or on hangers that can distort its shape. When storing, use a hat box or hang it carefully using padded hangers to prevent stretching or creasing. 


### How long do Houston Astros hats typically last?

With regular wear, a quality Houston Astros hat can last 3-5 years with proper care. The lifespan depends on the frequency of washing, exposure to sunlight, and how you store the hat between uses. 

Look for fading, fraying edges, and loose stitching to determine if your hat needs replacement. Authentic MLB caps are known to last longer due to their premium materials and construction.
