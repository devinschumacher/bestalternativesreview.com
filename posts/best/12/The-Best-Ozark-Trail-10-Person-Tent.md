The tent includes nine ground stakes and two vestibules for gear storage, along with a full rainfly for additional weather protection. The vestibules keep boots and equipment dry while you set up camp. 


### How does the Ozark Trail 10 Person Tent compare in price to similar tents?

Compared to similarly sized tents, the Ozark Trail 10 Person tent offers excellent value for money. It's competitively priced at around $330, offering a balance of durability and performance features typical of higher-priced tents in this category. 

While some premium tents in the same category may offer slightly more advanced features, the Ozark Trail tent delivers reliable performance and comfortable accommodations at a more accessible price point. 


### What maintenance requirements does the Ozark Trail 10 Person Tent need?

Regular maintenance for the Ozark Trail 10 Person Tent includes checking and tightening all guy lines after each use, cleaning the tent with mild soap and water, and storing it in a dry place with all poles and stakes organized. 

Every few years, inspect the poles for bends or cracks and replace any worn or damaged components. The waterproof coating should last several seasons with proper care, but recoating may be necessary after 3-5 years of regular use. 


### Can the Ozark Trail 10 Person Tent be set up in various configurations?

The tent's poles can be rearranged for different setup configurations, including a standard free-standing setup or a wall-free configuration for added interior space. This flexibility allows you to optimize the tent's layout based on the terrain and weather conditions.
