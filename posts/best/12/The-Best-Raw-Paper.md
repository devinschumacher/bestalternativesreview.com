## Buyer's Guide

Raw paper products offer an uncoated, natural alternative to traditionally finished paper. Understanding their properties and applications is essential for selecting the right type of raw paper. 


### Material Composition

Raw paper consists of cellulose fibers derived from plants, typically unbleached and untreated. The fiber quality affects paper strength and durability. Higher quality raw paper uses long plant fibers that resist tearing and provide better printing characteristics. 


### Paper Texture and Finish

The texture of raw paper ranges from smooth to slightly toothy. Textured surfaces enhance visual appeal and provide better ink absorption. The finish affects both print quality and paper feel - a more natural finish preserves the paper's raw quality. 


### Eco-Friendly Considerations

Raw paper products often promote sustainability through their production process, using fewer chemicals and energy. Recyclability varies by product, so check for certified sustainable sources and recyclability labels when selecting raw paper items. 


### Application Suitability

Raw paper excels in artistic and craft projects where natural texture is desired. It's suitable for writing materials, printing projects requiring better ink absorption, and eco-conscious packaging solutions. Understand the specific requirements of your intended use to choose the right paper type. 


## FAQ


### What is raw paper?

Raw paper, also known as uncoated paper, is made directly from wood pulp without additional coatings. This natural material retains its original properties, including slight texture and absorbency. 

Unlike coated papers, which have a smooth surface ideal for printing, raw paper gives your artwork a more organic feel and allows ink to mingle with its fibers.
