## FAQ


### What makes the Cold Steel Gi Tanto unique?

The handle features a distinctive 4.25-inch black G10 grip, providing superior traction and balance. Overall, it's a versatile blade that excels in both cutting and stabbing applications. 


### How does the Gi Tanto compare to Cold Steel's other models?

Compared to Cold Steel's more affordable models, the Gi Tanto features premium materials and construction. It shares similarities with the CTS-204, which has a similar tanto shape but different grip configuration. 

Its performance and durability place it between the middle-priced options like the Desert Eagle and the premium models such as the CTS-208.
