## Buyer's Guide

Alice in Wonderland tea cups bring a touch of whimsy to your tea drinking experience. These collectible cups often feature iconic characters and designs from the classic story. Whether you're a fan of Lewis Carroll's tale or simply appreciate quirky collectibles, these tea cups blend charm with practicality. 


### Character and Design Selection

When choosing Wonderland characters, consider which ones hold the most appeal for you.

### Material and Quality

The quality of the material can affect both the durability and value of your cups. Bone china is popular for its strength and lustrous finish, while ceramic offers a slightly coarser texture. Consider the weight and feel of the cups in person before purchasing to ensure they meet your expectations for both use and display. 


### Size and Capacity

Most tea cups hold between 10 to 15 ounces, suitable for both tea and coffee. If you prefer larger servings or drink hot chocolate, consider cups with slightly larger capacities. The standard size is usually appropriate for daily use, while smaller cups might be better for collectors who display them without using them.

### Set Versus Individual Cups

Complete sets, while pricier, often offer better value through quantity discounts. They also help create cohesive display pieces for enthusiasts. Individual cups allow more flexibility in collection building but may not offer the same cost advantages. Consider whether you'll use the cups regularly enough to justify a complete set.
