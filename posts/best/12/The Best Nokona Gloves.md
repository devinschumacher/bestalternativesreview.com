## Buyer's Guide

Nokona gloves combine durability, performance, and traditional craftsmanship. When selecting a pair, consider several key factors to find gloves that match your riding style and environmental needs. 


### Construction and Materials

Nokona gloves feature premium cowhide leather construction with select models incorporating horsehide for increased durability. The leather is typically backed with moisture-wicking mesh to keep hands dry. Premium stitching and reinforced palm areas enhance longevity during active use. 


### Fitting and Ergonomics

Proper fit is essential for both comfort and performance. Nokona gloves usually offer a slightly longer cuff to protect the wrist. The palm should provide adequate surface area for grip while allowing flexibility. Consider whether you prefer a straight thumb or the popular mitten-style design. 


### Protection and Features

Look for reinforced palm padding and knuckle protection in key impact areas. Some models include thumb stabilizers and additional padding for enhanced grip on the reins. Consider additional features like touchscreen compatibility, ventilation panels, or elastic wrist closures for specific needs. 


### Wear and Tear Resistance

Higher-quality Nokona gloves resist cracking and tearing through superior leather selection and construction. The stitching should be secure to prevent unraveling. Premium models often include nickel hardware for secure button closures and reinforcing tape on stress points. 


## FAQ


### What makes Nokona gloves unique?

Nokona gloves are known for their premium quality materials, traditional craftsmanship, and attention to detail. They use premium steerhide leather for durability and soft sheepskin for the palms, combining natural warmth with exceptional grip. 

These gloves are handcrafted in the USA using century-old techniques, with each pair made to exacting standards. The results are gloves that not only perform well but also develop a natural patina over time, becoming more comfortable with each use. 


### What styles of Nokona gloves are available?

The Nokona lineup includes various styles, from everyday casual gloves to more formal options. Their classic designs range from simple leather mitts to fingered gloves, all featuring signature details like decorative topstitching and adjustable wrist closures. 

Each style is available in multiple color options, from rich earthy tones to striking black and red combinations. The sizing runs true to medium, with half-sizes also available for precise fit. 


### How should I care for my Nokona gloves?

To maintain the quality and appearance of your Nokona gloves, it's important to keep them clean and conditioned. Use a soft cloth to remove dust and debris, then apply a high-quality leather conditioner specifically designed for steerhide. 

Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the leather. When storing your gloves, make sure they have plenty of air circulation to prevent mildew and maintain their shape. 


### What sizes are available in Nokona gloves?

The standard sizing chart for Nokona gloves runs from small to large, with half-sizes available between medium and large. To determine your size, measure the circumference of your hand at the base of your fingers and compare it to the chart provided on their website. 

If you fall between sizes, it's generally better to choose the larger size for more comfortable wear. The gloves can be slightly adjusted with the elastic wrist bands to provide a secure fit. 


### Are Nokona gloves suitable for cold weather?

While Nokona's traditional leather construction isn't designed for extreme cold, these gloves do offer good warmth for everyday use and light winter activities. The sheepskin palms provide additional warmth and moisture resistance compared to standard leather. 

In very cold weather, you may want to consider wearing inner liners or gloves underneath your Nokonas for additional warmth, especially while riding or engaging in active pursuits. 


### How do I know if Nokona gloves are right for me?

The Nokona gloves are particularly well-suited for horseback riders, nature enthusiasts, and anyone who values premium quality leather goods. Their durability and natural warmth make them ideal for both casual wear and more formal occasions. 

Before purchasing, consider your specific needs and activities. The traditional designs work well for both men and women, though the sizing tends to run true to medium.
