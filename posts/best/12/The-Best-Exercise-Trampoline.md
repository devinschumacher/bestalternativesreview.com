## Buyer's Guide

Exercise trampolines offer an engaging way to improve cardiovascular health, coordination, and overall fitness. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select a trampoline that matches your fitness goals and space constraints. 


### Construction Quality and Safety Features

Safety should be your top priority when choosing an exercise trampoline. The bed material should be solid and made from durable materials like steel or aluminum. Look for trampolines with a powder-coated steel frame for lasting performance. Safety nets, secure fencing, and protective pads are essential for preventing accidents during use. 


### Jump Surface and Dimensions

The jump surface should be at least 12 feet in diameter for comfortable jumping without collisions with the frame. The mat material should absorb impact and provide good bounce. Consider the total width of the trampoline—adequate clearance around the edges is crucial for safe jumping. 


### Spring System

A high-quality spring system directly impacts the trampoline's bounce and longevity. Count the number of springs per edge; more springs generally provide better bounce consistency. Springs should be made from corrosion-resistant materials like stainless steel and feature protective covers to prevent injury. 


### Grounding and Base

Proper grounding prevents tipping and ensures stability. The trampoline should come with metal feet or straps to anchor it to the ground. The base should distribute weight evenly and prevent shifting, especially on uneven surfaces. Consider a quality tarp or cover to protect the bottom of the mat from damage. 


## FAQ


### What is an exercise trampoline?

Combining the fun of bouncing with fitness benefits, an exercise trampoline is a backyard fitness center that provides a low-impact way to jump and exercise. It features a spring system that helps you bounce safely and can include padded surfaces and handles for varied workouts. 

Unlike recreational trampolines, exercise models are built for sustained use and resist deformation under repeated jumping. They're available in various sizes and features to suit different fitness goals and spaces. 


### Are trampoline workouts suitable for all fitness levels?

Most trampoline workouts are adaptable for all fitness levels, though beginners should start with shorter sessions and simple exercises. It's important to start slowly and gradually increase difficulty to prevent injuries and build strength. 

Trampoline exercise is generally low impact compared to running or jumping on hard surfaces, making it suitable for people recovering from injuries or dealing with joint pain. Always consult with a healthcare provider before starting a new exercise program. 


### How do I determine the right size trampoline for my space?

The main considerations are available space and the number of users. For individual use in a small backyard, a 12-foot round trampoline is adequate. For larger spaces or multiple users, 14-foot rounds or 12-foot squares provide more jumping area. 

Consider the minimum safe landing area around your trampoline. You'll need approximately 3-4 feet of clear space in all directions, plus a protective border to prevent falls off the mat. 


### What should I look for in trampoline springs and padding?

Springs should be made of durable stainless steel or zinc-plated steel with rust-resistant finishes. The number of springs typically ranges from 120 to 180 for standard 12-foot models, with more springs providing better shock absorption and stability. 

Professional-grade padding is essential for safety, covering the springs, frame edges, and landing surface. Look for padding with a thick, closed-cell foam core that's encapsulated in a tear-resistant cover for lasting protection. 


### Can I use my trampoline year-round in cold weather?

Outdoor trampolines perform best in temperatures between 32°F (0°C) and 104°F (40°C). Most professional-grade models include weather-resistant features, but consider how you'll store the trampoline during extreme cold or very hot weather. 

Regular use in cold weather may require additional maintenance, such as checking padding integrity and tightening springs. In very cold climates, storing the trampoline in a garage or shed can help preserve its condition. 


### How much maintenance does a trampoline require?

The most crucial maintenance tasks are regular inspection of springs, checking for loose or broken parts, and ensuring the padding remains intact. The landing mat should be vacuumed weekly and the frame should be cleaned monthly. 

During seasonal storage, thoroughly inspect all components for wear. Apply a light coat of silicone to springs and moving parts to prevent corrosion, and store in a dry, protected area to prevent damage from environmental elements.
