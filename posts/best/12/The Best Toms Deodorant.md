The natural deodorant from Tom's of Maine offers 48 hours of odor protection with its sustaining formula of palm oil, castor oil, and soybean oil. While the plastic-free paper packaging and aluminum-free composition make it a sustainable choice, the application requires a bit more effort than conventional deodorants, needing periodic readjustment to maintain just the right amount of product. Overall, users find it particularly effective for overnight freshness rather than all-day protection in warmer climates.
