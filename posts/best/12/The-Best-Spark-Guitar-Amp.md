## Buyer's Guide

A spark guitar amp delivers powerful sound with distinct timing, ideal for modern metal and high-gain tones. These amplifiers combine traditional tube sound with digital processing for enhanced versatility. When selecting a spark guitar amp, consider the following key factors to find the right equipment for your playing style and venue requirements. 


### Power and Wattage

Spark guitar amps vary in power, from 100 watts to over 400 watts. Higher wattage handles louder volumes and heavier distortion. Consider the size of your venue and your typical playing volume to determine appropriate wattage. For practice or small gigs, 100-200 watts is suitable. Larger venues or live performances may require 300-400 watts. 


### Speaker Configuration

Most spark guitar amps offer multiple speaker configurations, including 2x12, 1x12, and 4x12 cabinets. The number of speakers affects tone and volume. Dual 12" cabinets provide balanced tone, while single 12" cabinets are more versatile. Four 12" cabinets deliver extreme volume but are heavier and less portable. 


### Power Handling and Impedance

Check the amp's power handling capacity and matching requirements for your speaker cabinet. Common impedances range from 4 to 16 ohms. Ensure the amp's maximum power rating matches your speaker cabinet's handling capabilities to avoid damage. Higher impedance cabinets (8-16 ohms) are more compatible with a wider range of amps. 


### Connectivity and Features

Important connectivity options include speaker outs, effects loops, and DI outputs. Speaker outs range from single 8Ω to multiple 4Ω configurations. Effects loops allow you to add external effects processors without interference. DI outputs enable direct recording or connection to PA systems. Consider additional features like onboard effects, MIDI control, and USB recording capabilities based on your needs.
