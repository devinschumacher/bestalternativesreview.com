## Buyer's Guide

A squirrel picnic table feeder is a specialized bird feeder designed to mount on an outdoor picnic table, providing an elevated feeding station for backyard birds and small wildlife. These feeders combine practicality with aesthetic appeal, making them a popular addition to patios and outdoor living spaces. 


### Ultraviolet Protection

Like any outdoor furniture, picnic table feeders are exposed to harsh UV rays that can cause materials to fade, crack, or warp over time. Look for feeders made from UV-resistant materials such as high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene, or treated wood. These materials maintain their color and structure longer, ensuring your feeder continues to look attractive season after season. 


### Waterproof Design

Effective squirrel feeders prevent seeds from getting wet, which can lead to mold growth and spoilage. Opt for models with fully sealed compartments and drip-resistant designs that direct excess moisture away from stored seeds. Some advanced models feature internal heating elements that prevent seed trays from freezing in cold weather, ensuring consistent accessibility for wildlife. 


### Ergonomic Mounting Options

The right mounting mechanism ensures your feeder remains stable and secure while protecting your picnic table surface. Common mounting options include clamp-style attachments, brackets, and dedicated picnic table inserts. Consider feeders with adjustable mounting features that allow you to position the feeder at an ideal height and angle, while still being visible from your seating area. 


### Feeder Capacity and Accessibility

Capacity varies widely among squirrel feeders, from small single-compartment designs holding a few cups of seed to large multi-level feeders that can hold several pounds. Consider your local wildlife population and storage needs when selecting capacity. Most feeders feature removable seed trays for easy refilling, but premium models may offer additional features like automatic seed dispensers or built-in seed storage compartments. 


## FAQ


### What is a squirrel picnic table feeder?

A squirrel picnic table feeder is a specialized bird feeder designed to attach directly to picnic tables or other raised surfaces. These compact feeders protect seed from rain and keep squirrels and other ground-dwelling animals at bay. 

Unlike traditional ground feeders, these compact designs mount on tables, making them easy to reach while eliminating the risk of seed contamination from the ground. They come in various sizes and shapes, from simple tube feeders tomore elaborate multi-compartment designs. 


### How do I install a squirrel picnic table feeder?

Installation is straightforward. Most feeders come with a mounting clip or screw mechanism that attaches directly to a stable picnic table surface. Ensure the table is wood or a similarly sturdy material, as feeders can be quite heavy with seed and water. 

Installation height matters - feeders placed too high might be inaccessible, while those too low risk attracting unwanted animals like raccoons or dogs. Ideal height allows you to reach the feeder comfortably while standing. 


### What kind of birdseed is best for squirrel picnic table feeders?

Black oil sunflower seeds are the most reliable choice, as they have a high meats-to-hulls ratio and attract a wide variety of finches and sparrows. These seeds are also small enough to prevent waste through scattering. 

Avoid cheap blends with lots of filler grains like milo or cracked corn, as these can spoil quickly in an outdoor feeder. For optimal freshness, choose bulk seeds or feeders that include seed keepers to shield the grains. 


### How much food should I put in a squirrel picnic table feeder?

Fill the feeder to about 2/3 capacity. This prevents seed from spilling out during wind or vibration while ensuring the feeder remains full for several days between refills. 

Regularly check the feeder and refill it when the seed level drops below 1/4 full. Overfilling can lead to seed spoilage and attracts more attention from squirrels and other animals. 


### How long do squirrel picnic table feeders last?

With proper care, a high-quality squirrel picnic table feeder can last 5-10 years, depending on factors like material durability and frequency of use. Stainless steel feeders typically last the longest, followed by plastic feeders with metal components. 

Check the feeder for signs of wear or corrosion annually. Replace any parts that show visible damage or signs of weakening. Regular cleaning and quick-drying help maintain the feeder's lifespan. 


### How should I clean a squirrel picnic table feeder?

Empty and clean the feeder at least monthly using a mild soap solution and warm water. Rinse thoroughly to remove any residue, then allow the feeder to completely air-dry before refilling. 

Regular cleaning prevents mold growth and seed spoilage. For persistent odor or mold issues, immerse the feeder in a solution of one part vinegar to four parts water for 30 minutes before thorough cleaning and drying.
