## Buyer's Guide

Small cat trees are an ideal solution for apartments and homes with limited space, offering cats a vertical scratching post and resting spot. When selecting a small cat tree, consider factors such as the cat's weight, preferred height, and the style and materials used in construction. 


### Cat Weight Consideration

Ensure the tree's weight capacity exceeds your cat's weight by at least 20%. This prevents strain on the structure and ensures your cat's safety while using the tree.

### Optimal Height

Cats typically prefer trees between 4 and 6 feet tall, providing enough vertical space for them to stretch and play. The top platform should be at a height where your cat can scratch and rest without straining. 


### Construction Quality

Sturdy horizontal bars connected by square or oval-shaped posts provide a more stable base than round posts. The joints should be reinforced with metal brackets to prevent wobble. Consider trees made from hardwood or engineered wood with non-slip bases.

### Scratching Surface

The scratching surface should be at least 12 inches wide and made from durable materials like sisal rope or solid wood. Avoid synthetic surfaces that may irritate your cat's claws when filing them down. 


## FAQ

![Small-Cat-Tree-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Small-Cat-Tree-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What size should I choose?

Small cat trees typically measure between 4 to 6 feet tall, making them ideal for apartments and smaller living spaces. The base width usually ranges from 16 to 24 inches to ensure stability. 

Consider your cat's height and jumping ability when selecting a height. Shorter cats may prefer trees under 5 feet, while active breeds might need taller options. 


### What materials are used in construction?

Most small cat trees are made from pine or fir wood, offering durability and affordability. Some premium models feature bamboo or solid wood construction for added strength and aesthetic appeal. 

The platforms are usually made from wood with non-slip surfaces, while sisal rope provides scratching opportunities. Some trees also include carpeting or soft pads for resting. 

![Small-Cat-Tree-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Small-Cat-Tree-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do I choose the right shape?

Popular shapes include vertical towers, A-frames, and rectangular designs. Vertical towers offer the most climbing surface and are space-efficient. 

A-frame designs provide excellent stability but take up more floor space. Rectangular trees offer varied levels but require more room to maneuver. 


### What features should I look for?

Essential features include multiple resting platforms, climbing levels, and built-in scratching posts. Look for trees with sturdy bases and sharp corners removed for safety. 

Some trees include shelves, hiding spots, or catwalks for added entertainment. Check that all joints are secure and materials are child-safe if there are other pets or small children in the home. 

![Small-Cat-Tree-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Small-Cat-Tree-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How much space do I need?

Measure your available space before purchasing. Allow at least 1-2 feet of clearance around the base of the tree. 

Consider where you plan to place the tree. Corners maximize space usage, while walls provide natural support for tall trees. 


### How do I introduce my cat to the new tree?

Place the tree in a quiet area and let your cat investigate it at their own pace. Start by sitting nearby and offering treats to encourage exploration. 

Gradually increase the time spent near the tree, then incorporate play sessions to make it a positive experience. Regular interaction helps your cat become comfortable with the new fixture.
