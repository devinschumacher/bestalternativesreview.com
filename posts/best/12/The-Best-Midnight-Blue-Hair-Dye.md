## Buyer's Guide

Midnight blue hair dye offers the depth and intensity of black with a striking blue undertone, creating a bold statement look. Understanding the dyeing process and considering several key factors will help you achieve professional results at home. 


### Color Selection and Undertones

Midnight blue dye comes in various shades, ranging from a deep, rich blue to a more purple-toned appearance. Consider your personal style and the overall look you want to achieve. Testing the color on a small patch of skin first can help determine if the shade matches your expectations.
