## Buyer's Guide

A dog Murphy bed provides a convenient, space-saving solution for your pet's sleep needs while enhancing your home's functionality. These beds double as storage, featuring built-in compartments that tuck away when not in use, making them ideal for apartments, small spaces, or homes with multiple pets. 


### Storage Capacity and Design

Consider the bed's storage volume to determine how many items you can store, from blankets and toys to extra pet supplies. Look for beds with clear lids or windows to easily see what's inside without lifting the lid. The design should complement your room's aesthetic while providing stable support for your pet's weight.

### Comfort Features and Materials

High-quality foam cores and plush covers provide both support and comfort. Look for beds with removable, washable covers for easy cleaning. Some models feature temperature-controlled heating pads or orthopedic supports for pets with joint issues, though these add complexity and cost. 


### Mechanism and Ease of Use

The bed's opening mechanism should be smooth and secure. Manual beds typically fold out from one side, while power beds may offer more space but require electrical access. Consider the height of the bed and how it opens - some beds are easier to access than others, especially for older pets or those with mobility issues.

### Installation and Space Requirements

Measure your space carefully before purchasing. Consider the bed's footprint when fully extended and its storage profile when closed. The wall surface behind the bed should be strong enough to support the weight of the bed when fully extended. Some beds require mounting hardware, while others simply sit on the floor. 


## FAQ

![Dog-Murphy-Bed-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Dog-Murphy-Bed-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a dog Murphy bed?

A dog Murphy bed is a wall-mounted bed that can be raised and lowered. This space-saving design is ideal for apartments or small homes where floor space is limited, particularly for pet owners who want to provide their furry friend with a cozy place to sleep. 

When not in use, the bed mounts flush against the wall, leaving the room free for other activities. The bed can be easily accessed by raising it to waist height, making it perfect for pets who may have difficulty navigating stairs or traditional beds. 


### What sizes are available?

Popular sizes range from small beds for cats or small dogs to larger beds that can accommodate medium-sized dogs. Common dimensions include 36 inches long for small breeds, 48 inches long for medium breeds, and 60 inches long for larger dogs. 

Most manufacturers offer beds in increments of 6 inches in length, allowing you to find the right size for your pet. Width typically varies between 20 and 24 inches, which is suitable for most pets.

### How much weight can they support?

The weight capacity of dog Murphy beds ranges from 50 to 150 pounds, depending on the model and manufacturer. Most beds are rated to support up to 100 pounds, making them suitable for medium-sized dogs. 

If you have a larger pet or multiple pets, it's important to choose a bed with sufficient weight capacity. Always check the manufacturer's specifications to ensure the bed can safely support your pet's weight. 


### What materials are used in construction?

Most dog Murphy beds are constructed from either metal or wood, with metal being the most common material. Metal beds offer advantages such as lighter weight, easier mounting, and increased durability. 

Wooden beds provide a more natural look and feel but may be heavier and require more regular maintenance. Some beds incorporate both materials, using metal frames with wood slats or a metal box spring design with wood surfaces. 

![Dog-Murphy-Bed-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Dog-Murphy-Bed-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do I install a Murphy bed?

Installation typically requires basic tools such as a drill, level, and screwdriver. Many beds come with detailed instructions and mounting hardware. Professional installation may be necessary for complex models or in apartments without proper mounting options. 

The process generally involves marking and drilling wall holes, attaching mounting brackets, and raising the bed to position it flush with the wall. Some models require additional support structures or adjustable mounting systems to ensure proper alignment. 


### Are these beds difficult to maintain?

Murphy beds made from metal require minimal maintenance, primarily consisting of regular dusting and occasional lubrication of the hinges to prevent sticking. Wooden beds may need more frequent care, including cleaning, sealing, and periodic sanding to maintain their finish. 

Many beds include features that simplify maintenance, such as self-closing mechanisms that prevent the bed from hanging open and smooth gliding mechanisms that reduce wear and tear.
