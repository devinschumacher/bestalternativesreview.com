## Buyer's Guide

Understanding the specific needs and features of glass Tupperware can significantly enhance your food storage experience. This comprehensive guide examines key aspects of glass container design, material properties, and practical applications to help you select durable, versatile storage solutions for your kitchen. 


### Material Durability and Safety

Glass containers resist scratches, dents, and rust, maintaining the integrity of stored foods. Look for tempered glass products that undergo heat treatment for enhanced strength. While glass won't react with acidic or alkaline foods, avoid storing highly acidic items like tomatoes or citrus in uncoated glass to prevent potential reactions.

### Size and Shape Options

Standard sizes (1, 2, 4, 8-cup) offer convenient portion control, while nesting sets maximize storage space. Consider specialized shapes for particular foods: rectangular containers work well for long items like vegetables, while round containers save counter space. For microwave use, ensure microwave-safe markings and avoid metal accents. 


### Sealing Mechanisms

Quality sealing systems prevent leaks and odors. Screw-top lids with smooth, food-grade rubber seals provide a secure closure. Some containers feature airtight bands with multiple sealing points for extra security. Consider containers with built-in pour spouts for liquids and specialized caps for dry ingredients.

### Care and Maintenance

Hand wash glass containers to prevent scratches that can compromise clarity and integrity. Avoid sudden temperature changes, such as placing hot containers in cold water, which can cause thermal shock. For dishwasher use, check manufacturer guidelines; some specialized lids may need handwashing. 


## FAQ

![Glass-Tupperware-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Glass-Tupperware-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is Glass Tupperware?

Our Glass Tupperware collection features durable, BPA-free containers made from high-quality borosilicate glass. These products combine sleek design with practical functionality, offering an eco-friendly alternative to traditional plastic containers. 

The glass used in these products undergoes a special heating process to eliminate stress points and prevent cracking. They are dishwasher safe and suitable for both microwave and oven use, making them ideal for various food storage and preparation needs. 


### What sizes are available?

Our glass containers come in a range of sizes, from small 1-cup servings to larger 32-ounce containers. Each set typically includes multiple sizes to accommodate different portion needs. 

Specific size options vary by product, but common sizes include 16oz, 24oz, and 32oz, with corresponding lid diameters of 4", 5", and 6" respectively. 

![Glass-Tupperware-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Glass-Tupperware-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Are they microwave and dishwasher safe?

Yes, all our glass containers are microwave-safe and dishwasher-friendly. The products are designed for repeated use in both microwave and dishwasher environments without losing their shape or integrity. 

While these containers are safe for dishwashing, we recommend hand-washing the lids to prevent potential warping or damage during the wash cycle. 


### What types of food are suitable for these containers?

These glass containers are suitable for storing a wide variety of foods, including leftovers, homemade sauces, and room temperature or chilled dishes. They are especially recommended for foods that require clear containers for inspection, like salads or dips. 

Avoid using the containers for hot oil or acidic foods that can react with the glass. Additionally, keep in mind that while the containers are heat-resistant, they should not be used directly on a stovetop or under a broiler. 

![Glass-Tupperware-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Glass-Tupperware-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do they compare to plastic containers?

Glass Tupperware offers several advantages over plastic containers. It's made from a natural material that doesn't harbor bacteria or release harmful chemicals, making it ideal for food storage. The glass also provides superior visibility, allowing you to see the contents at a glance. 

However, glass containers are heavier and more fragile than plastic ones, requiring careful handling to prevent breakage. They're also more expensive upfront but can last longer and are reusable in environments where plastic might be a health concern. 


### What's the best way to clean them?

Hand wash with warm, soapy water for optimal cleaning. While dishwasher safe, some lids may warp during the cycle. For stubborn stains, soak the container briefly before washing. 

Rinse thoroughly and ensure the container is completely dry before storing to prevent water spots and improve longevity. Consider using microfiber cloths or sponge designed for glass cleaning to maintain their clarity.
