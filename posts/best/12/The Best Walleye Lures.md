## Buyer's Guide

Walleye lures come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and designs, each intended to mimic natural walleye prey and trigger fish movements. Understanding the key features and components of walleye lures will help you select the right ones for your fishing conditions and target locations. 


### Material Construction

Modern walleye lures are primarily made from high-diameter resin, which offers durability and resistance to water damage. Premium options incorporate stainless steel inserts or wire for added strength, especially in the hook areas. The material determines the lure's floatability, weight retention, and resistance to wear from fish teeth.

### Shape and Size

Walleye lures range from small dodger-style plugs to large crankbaits, with common sizes typically between 1.5 inches and 3 inches. Fish behavior, water clarity, and seasonal factors influence the most effective dimensions. Generally, darker colors perform better in stained water, while brighter hues excel in clear conditions. 


### Retrieve Patterns

The desired retrieve pattern dictates the lure's design. Vibrating plungers and spinnerbaits excel at vertical jigging, while crankbaits and topwaters mimic suspending baitfish. The lure's depth rating and diving characteristics affect its performance during different retrieve speeds and angling techniques.

### Joint Design and Action

Quality walleye lures feature precision-engineered joints that maintain consistent action during the retrieve. Spring-loaded hinge joints enable natural body rotation, while fixed-body designs offer simpler, more predictable movement. The joint's quality directly impacts the lure's effectiveness in triggering strikes. 


## FAQ

![Walleye-Lures-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Walleye-Lures-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What types of walleye lures are available?

Walleye lures come in various styles including crankbaits, spinnerbaits, jigs, and soft plastic baits. Each type mimics different aspects of walleye prey, from minnows to insects, allowing anglers to match the forage fish eat. 

Popular designs include deep-diving crankbaits for structure fish, small jigs for suspended walleye, and noisy spinnerbaits to trigger bites in lowlight conditions. The variety helps account for walleye's reputation as a finicky feeder. 


### What crankbait features are important for walleye?

Key factors include shape (deep-bodied for structure, slim-bodied for open water), divergent (how far it runs underwater), and color patterns (natural looks like shad or white spots). 

The bait's length-to-waist ratio affects dive depth and wobble, crucial for locating active fish. Some models have lip thickness that can double as a strike indicator, helping detect subtle bites. 

![Walleye-Lures-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Walleye-Lures-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do spinnerbaits work for walleye?

Spinnerbaits catch walleye by combining flash (from multiple blades) with vibration (produced by the blade's motion). The propeller spins as the bait moves through the water, creating both visual attraction and sound attraction. 

Walmart-style blades and Colorado blades generate different presentations. The former creates more surface disturbance, while the latter produces subtle wiggles and flash deeper in the water column. 


### What's the best way to fish soft plastic baits for walleye?

Fish them slowly along structure such as submerged weeds, rocks, or docks. Use zig rigs or Carolina rigs to hold the bait in position. Consider using powerbait or scent enhancers to increase attraction. 

Target walleye where they naturally feed - near structure, in current seams, or along weed edges. Vary retrieve speed and angle to find what triggers strikes, as walleye often hit on the drop or pause.

### Should I use live bait with my lures?

While not necessary, adding live bait like nightcrawlers, minnows, or leeches can significantly increase bite rates, especially for wary fish. Natural baits also help identify specific forage the walleye are eating. 

When using live bait with artificial lures, consider using scentless presentations to prevent the natural bait from stealing fish. Experiment with different combinations to find what works best in your local conditions. 


### How can I tell if my lures match local walleye prey?

Research local walleye diets, typically focusing on minnows, crayfish, and insects. Look for lures that closely match these prey types in terms of color, size, and shape. Natural forage color patterns often work best. 

Pay attention to local fishing reports and discussions about what's working. Successful anglers often match the hodgepodge of native forage, using multiple lure types to cover all bases.
