## Buyer's Guide

The Wandering Jew plant (Tradescantia zebrina) is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens, appreciated for its distinctive zebra-like leaves and easy care requirements. Understanding their specific needs will help you grow healthy, vibrant plants. 


### Light Requirements

These plants thrive in bright, indirect sunlight but can also tolerate filtered light through a window. Avoid direct sunlight, as it may scorch their delicate leaves. If growing indoors, place them near a window where they can receive ample natural light. 


### Watering Needs

Wandering Jew plants prefer consistent moisture but dislike overly wet soil. Water when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch. They thrive in well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Reduce watering frequency during winter months when growth slows. 


### Soil and Fertilization

Use a well-draining potting mix, ideally one formulated for succulents or tropical plants. Apply a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer every 4-6 weeks during the growing season (spring and summer). Avoid fertilizing during autumn and winter when plants are dormant. 


### Maintenance and Pruning

To keep your Wandering Jew plant healthy and bushy, pinch back new growth regularly. This encourages more extensive branching and prevents leggy, straggly growth. Remove any yellowing or brown leaves to maintain the plant's appearance and prevent potential issues spread.
