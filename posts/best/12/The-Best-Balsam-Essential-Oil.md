### Sourcing and Quality

Quality balsam essential oil comes from sustainable sources with transparent supply chains. Look for products that specify the exact balsam species, extraction method (steam distillation is standard), and concentration level. The oil should have a clean, balsamic aroma without chemical off-notes.
