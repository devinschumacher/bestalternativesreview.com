The light source can be customized with lenses or diffusers to create different atmospheric effects, from soft ambient lighting to spotlighting specific areas.

## FAQ


### What is a flameless tealight candle?

A flameless tealight candle is an electronic alternative to traditional wax candles that mimics their appearance and behavior. These candles use LED lights and a battery-powered mechanism to create a warm, ambient glow without the risk of fire or open flames. 

They come in various sizes and designs, from simple white LED bulbs to detailed replicas of traditional tealights, allowing users to match their aesthetic preferences and occasions. 


### How long do flameless tealight candles last?

Each LED bulb typically lasts for 10-12 hours on a single battery charge, equivalent to a standard tealight burning time. A single AA battery can power a flameless candle for dozens of uses. 

To extend battery life, consider using rechargeable batteries and ensuring the LED assembly is properly sealed to prevent dust and moisture accumulation. 


### What are the main benefits of flameless tealight candles?

These candles provide the atmospheric appeal of real candles with superior safety and convenience. They eliminate fire hazards, reduce wax and scent emissions, and offer precise light control through adjustable brightness settings. 

Flameless tealights are ideal for decorative purposes, sleep environments, and situations where traditional candles are impractical or prohibited, such as in hospitals, aircraft, or RVs. 


### How do you maintain and care for flameless tealight candles?

Regular maintenance includes checking battery life, ensuring proper enclosure, and keeping the LED assembly clean. Replace batteries when the candle's brightness diminishes, and avoid exposing the unit to extreme temperatures or direct water. 

To clean the LED bulb, use mild soap and water on a soft cloth. Do not submerge the electronic components in water or use harsh chemicals that can damage the LED or battery connections. 


### What are the key differences between flameless and battery-operated candles?

Battery-operated candles typically use incandescent bulbs and may flicker, while flameless candles use LED technology for consistent, reliable light. Battery-operated candles produce heat and require regular bulb replacement, whereas LED candles remain cool to the touch and have longer-lasting bulbs. 

Battery-operated candles are more affordable initially but may cost more in replacement bulbs over time. Flameless candles offer energy efficiency and longer operational life between changes. 


### Are flameless tealight candles suitable for outdoor use?

LED flameless candles can be used outdoors in protected environments where they are shielded from precipitation and strong winds. Always follow manufacturer guidelines regarding weather resistance and outdoor use. 

For outdoor gatherings, consider battery-operated candles designed specifically for outdoor use, which may be more resistant to environmental factors and provide better protection against moisture and temperature fluctuations.
