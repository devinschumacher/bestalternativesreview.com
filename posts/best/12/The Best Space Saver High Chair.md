## Buyer's Guide

Saving space while providing proper seating for meals can be a challenge, especially in smaller homes or apartments. Space saver high chairs offer a practical solution by folding down to save room when not in use. These versatile chairs expand easily for mealtime, ensuring your child has a comfortable place to sit while you maximize your living space. 


### Size and Space Requirements

When selecting a space saver high chair, measure the available space in your dining area to ensure the chair can fully extend. Consider the folded dimensions for storage and the expanded size for mealtime. Chairs typically require a minimum of 22 inches of space when closed and should have at least 30 inches of clearance when extended. 


### Extended Seat Support

Proper seat support is crucial for a comfortable and secure mealtime. The seat should be wide enough to prevent tipping and have adequate back support for your child's age. Look for chairs with adjustable seat heights and stable bases to prevent wobbling during use. 


### Quick Deployment Features

Space saver high chairs often include quick-release mechanisms to make deployment and storage simple. Look for chairs with one-handed folding systems and clear indicators when the chair is fully extended or closed. These features will help you transition between seating positions quickly without hassle. 


### Material Durability and Cleaning

Since high chairs see frequent use, durability is essential for daily mealtime. Choose a chair with a washable seat pad and frame made from sturdy materials like metal or heavy-duty plastic. The chair should be easy to clean and maintain between uses to keep it looking new. 


## FAQ


### What makes a high chair space saver?

Space saver high chairs are designed with compact storage in mind. Most fold down to a slim profile that tucks away easily in your kitchen or dining room. Some models convert into portable backpacks when not in use, allowing you to carry the chair with you while remaining lightweight. 

Look for chairs that store under your kitchen counter, desk, or dining table when not in use. The best space savers reduce clutter while keeping the chair readily accessible for feeding time. 


### How do space saver high chairs compare to traditional models?

While traditional high chairs offer more visible dining space, space savers provide an equivalent mealtime solution that doesn't take up counter space. They usually include key features like 5-point harnesses, adjustable trays, and dishwasher-safe parts for hassle-free mealtime. 

The main trade-off is visibility – space savers require bringing the chair out for use, while traditional models remain in view. Consider your dining habits and space constraints when choosing between the two. 


### What features should I look for in a space saver high chair?

Essential features include durable construction, easy assembly, and space-saving storage options. Look for models with smooth folding mechanisms, quiet storage solutions, and simple setup procedures for daily use. 

Additional features like reversible cushioning, built-in cup holders, and easy-to-clean surfaces can enhance the chair's functionality and ease of use. Read reviews to find a model that matches your specific needs. 


### How do I store a space saver high chair?

Most space saver chairs store under your kitchen counter or dining table when not in use. Some models include wall-mounted storage options or built-in hooks for additional space efficiency. Always store the chair with the tray in the upright position for optimal storage. 

Ensure your storage area is clean and dry to prevent damage to the chair. The best storage solutions allow for quick access when you need to use the chair for feeding. 


### Can I clean a space saver high chair?

Most space saver high chairs have dishwasher-safe parts, making cleanup quick and easy. The seat, tray, and other contact surfaces typically wipe clean with soap and water. Check your chair's specific cleaning instructions for the best care regimen. 

Avoid putting the chair in the dishwasher if it contains parts you'd rather hand wash, such as the child's plate or cup. Regular cleaning helps maintain hygiene and extends the chair's lifespan. 


### How much does a space saver high chair cost?

Pricing varies based on features and brand, but expect to pay between $75 and $150 for a quality space saver high chair. Basic models typically fall in the $75-100 range, while feature-heavy models may cost up to $150. 

Consider the chair's longevity and features when determining value. A more expensive model with premium materials and additional features often provides better long-term value than a basic model.
