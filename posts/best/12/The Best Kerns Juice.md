## Buyer's Guide

Kerns Juicers offer efficient and powerful ways to extract fresh juice from fruits and vegetables. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you choose the right model for your needs. 


### Suction Type vs. Centrifugal Models

Suction model juicers (also known as masticating or slow juicers) gently press and extract juice using a slow-rotating auger. These are ideal for health-conscious juicing, as they retain more nutrients and produce less foam. Centrifugal juicers use high-speed blades to chop and spin produce, making them faster but less effective at retaining nutrients and produce more heat during the process. 

![Kerns-Juice-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Kerns-Juice-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Capacity and Performance

Consider the machine's processing speed and capacity when evaluating performance. Higher-wattage motors typically handle tougher materials like wheatgrass and ice more effectively. For household use, a 250-watt or higher motor is recommended. Capacity determines how much produce you can process at once, ranging from small single-serving options to large multi-quart models suitable for family use. 


### Cleaning and Maintenance Requirements

Ease of cleaning and maintenance varies significantly between models. Look for designs with fewer small parts that are difficult to reach, and check if the machine includes dishwasher-safe parts. Some models require regular replacement of filter screens or other wear components, which can affect overall value. 

![Kerns-Juice-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Kerns-Juice-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Additional Features

Consider the inclusion of attachments or accessories that expand functionality. Common extras include grinding plates for nuts and seeds, smaller feed chutes for making tea, and specialized juicing cups. The warranty period and manufacturer's support can also impact long-term value, with most reputable brands offering at least one-year warranties. 


## FAQ

![Kerns-Juice-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Kerns-Juice-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What makes Kerns Juice unique?

Kerns Juice stands out in the market with its commitment to natural ingredients and minimal processing. Unlike many commercial juices, Kerns Juice uses freshly squeezed fruits and vegetables, preserving the maximum nutritional value and flavor. 

The company also prioritizes sustainable practices, from sourcing organic produce to using recyclable packaging materials. This dedication to quality and environmental responsibility sets their products apart. 


### Are Kerns Juice products organic?

While not all Kerns Juice products are certified organic, they use organic ingredients whenever possible. The company sources its produce from local farms that meet their strict quality standards. 

For products that contain non-organic ingredients, they work with suppliers who follow sustainable farming practices to minimize environmental impact. 

![Kerns-Juice-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Kerns-Juice-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What preservation method do they use?

Kerns Juice primarily uses cold-pressed extraction to minimize exposure to heat, which can degrade nutrients. This method preserves the juice's flavor and nutritional content while maintaining its fresh quality. 

Select products may use pasteurization for longer shelf life, but even these undergo minimal processing to retain as much natural goodness as possible. 


### How long does Kerns Juice stay fresh?

Unopened Kerns Juice products typically have a 30-45 day shelf life from the bottling date, depending on the specific product. This is slightly longer than many commercial juices due to their minimal processing. 

Once opened, the juice should be consumed within 3-7 days for the best quality and nutritional benefits. 

![Kerns-Juice-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Kerns-Juice-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Are there specific dietary considerations?

Due to the fresh nature of their products, Kerns Juice is not suitable for individuals with pasteurization requirements or those following extremely strict diets. The company advises consulting a healthcare provider before making significant dietary changes. 

Most people can enjoy Kerns Juice as part of a balanced diet, but those with specific dietary restrictions should familiarize themselves with the ingredient lists. 


### What makes their packaging eco-friendly?

Kerns Juice uses BPA-free plastic bottles with 100% recyclable materials, reducing waste and minimizing environmental impact. The company encourages customers to recycle their bottles through various local programs. 

For their glass bottles, they use returnable containers in select regions, further reducing single-use plastic waste and promoting sustainable consumption habits.
