## Buyer's Guide

When selecting Ohora nails, consider several key factors to find the perfect fit. The material quality, including the ratio of gel to acrylic, affects durability and flexibility. Consider the nail's shape and design compatibility with your natural nails. The application length should match your desired nail extension length. Proper curing time is crucial for optimal bond strength between the nail and natural nail bed. 


### Material Composition

Ohora nails are available in various material compositions. Understanding the difference between gel and acrylic nails helps in selecting the right type for your needs. Gel nails offer improved flexibility and chip resistance, while acrylic nails provide stronger support. The ideal material depends on your lifestyle and nail care routine.

### Shape and Design

The shape and design of Ohora nails should complement your natural nail structure. Common shapes include oval, square, and almond. Consider the width and length of the nail to ensure it fits naturally without appearing unnatural or too bulky. The design elements should enhance your nails' appearance while maintaining practicality. 


### Application Length

The application length of Ohora nails determines how much nail extension you achieve. The length should balance between looking natural and providing sufficient coverage. Shorter extensions work well for daily wear, while longer extensions suit special occasions. Consider how much nail you're comfortable trimming or maintaining.

### Curing Time Requirements

Proper curing time is essential for achieving a secure bond between the nail and natural nail bed. Different nail materials require varying curing times. Understanding these requirements helps prevent premature nail removal and maintains the longevity of your manicure. Following the recommended curing time ensures optimal adhesion and reduces the risk of nail detachment. 


## FAQ

![Ohora-Nails-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Ohora-Nails-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are Ohora Nails?

Ohora Nails are artificial nail extensions that mimic natural nails with a natural-looking finish. Available in full and partial sets, these nails require a special glue for application and regular maintenance to keep them in good condition. 

Each set comes with a pre-glued base nail that adheres to your natural nail bed, followed by various tips for different nail shapes and designs. The company offers multiple color options, allowing for customization of your nail appearance. 


### Who are Ohora Nails suitable for?

Ohora Nails are ideal for anyone looking to enhance their nails without the permanence of acrylic or gel nails. They're particularly suitable for brides, event planners, and professionals who need to maintain a cohesive nail appearance for extended periods. 

The nails are not suitable for individuals with brittle natural nails, as the glue may cause damage. They might also not be ideal for people with severe allergies to adhesives or chemicals. 

![Ohora-Nails-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Ohora-Nails-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How long do Ohora Nails typically last?

With proper care, including keeping them dry and protected from heavy-duty tasks, Ohora Nails typically last 2-3 weeks. The exact duration depends on individual nail health, usage frequency, and maintenance practices. 

Every two weeks, the natural nail grows enough to clip off the glued extension, making it a convenient system for regular nail care routines. 


### What maintenance is needed for Ohora Nails?

Maintenance for Ohora Nails involves regular clipping of the natural nail under the base, ensuring the extension remains at an appropriate length. Weekly soaking and filing help maintain shape and smoothness. 

During this time, avoid soaking your hands in chemicals like bleach or harsh cleaning solutions, as they can damage both the natural nail and the artificial extension. 

![Ohora-Nails-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Ohora-Nails-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How are Ohora Nails applied?

Application requires access to the special Ohora nail glue and possibly a UV lamp for curing (depending on the specific set purchased). The process involves cleaning your natural nails, applying the glue, placing the base nail, and setting it with the UV light if required. 

Placement and curing typically take about 30 minutes for each nail, with proper drying and shaping required after the curing process. 


### Are Ohora Nails safe for daily wear?

The nails are designed for regular daily wear and are a safer alternative to acrylics or gels, causing less damage to natural nails over time. However, daily heavy-duty tasks or frequent water exposure may affect their longevity. 

Individuals with health conditions or allergies should consult their dermatologist before use, as any artificial nail system carries potential risks of irritation or adverse reactions.
