## Buyer's Guide

Rocawear jeans combine streetwear style with traditional denim craftsmanship. Understanding their key characteristics and sizing options will help you find the perfect pair. 


### Material and Construction

Rocawear uses premium denim fabrics that undergo rigorous washing processes for their signature distressed look. The jeans incorporate reinforced stitching and quality hardware to ensure durability while maintaining a comfortable fit. 


### Sizing and Fit

Rocawear typically runs small in their measurements. Opt for your normal size for the most comfortable fit. Consider the rise (low, mid, or high) and inseam length that best suits your body type and personal preference. 


### Style Options

The collection includes both classic and contemporary styles. Popular options include skinny jeans for a slim silhouette, straight-leg jeans for a more relaxed look, and distressed styles for a worn-in appearance. 


### Care and Maintenance

These jeans require regular maintenance to preserve their quality. Machine wash them in cold water with similar colors, and air dry them to avoid shrinkage and color fading. Proper care will extend the life of your Rocawear jeans and maintain their distinctive appearance. 


## FAQ


### What makes Rocawear jeans different from other brands?

Rocawear jeans feature a blend of durable, machine-washable cotton that maintains shape and prevents shrinkage. Unlike some premium jeans that require specific care, these are designed for everyday wear while keeping your style fuss-free. 

The brand's signature comfort comes from their proprietary fabric construction, combining stretch with traditional denim to allow for natural movement while sitting or walking. 


### What wash styles do Rocawear offer?

From classic blue to acid washes, Rocawear offers a full spectrum of wash styles, including their popular "Rocaycle" collection made from recycled materials. 

Each wash style is available in both slim and straight fits to accommodate different body types and personal preferences. 


### How do I choose the right fit?

Size charts vary slightly between styles, so start by measuring your waist and compare to the provided measurements. The brand advises measuring after you finish working out to ensure the most accurate fit. 

If you value a more relaxed look, we recommend sizing up, as their jeans run slightly smaller than standard fits. 


### How durable are Rocawear jeans?

Rocawear employs a proprietary coating process that makes their jeans resistant to fading, fraying, and water damage without compromising on feel or texture. 

The company warranties their jeans against pilling and fading for as long as you own them, though minor wear may occur with daily use over time. 


### Which care instructions should I follow?

Machine wash your Rocawear jeans inside out with similar colors at a maximum of 60Â°C (140Â°F). Cold water can be used for everyday washes to preserve color and comfort. 

Air drying is recommended to maintain the shape and reduce wear and tear. If using a dryer, select a low heat setting and remove promptly while slightly damp to prevent wrinkles. 


### What sizing runs true to other brands?

Rocawear tends to run true to size for straight fits, with slim fits often requiring the next size up for an equivalent fit. 

Customers who wear skinny jeans from other brands may need to size up in Rocawear due to their engineered fit that combines stretch with traditional denim construction.
