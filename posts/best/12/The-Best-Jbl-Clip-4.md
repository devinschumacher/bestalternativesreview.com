## Buyer's Guide

The JBL Clip 4 is a portable Bluetooth speaker that delivers surprisingly powerful sound for its size. When choosing a similar speaker, consider the following key features and factors to find the right portable Bluetooth speaker for your needs. 


### Sound Quality and Output

Portable Bluetooth speakers vary greatly in their audio capabilities. The best models offer clear, balanced sound with decent bass response for their size. Key factors include the number of drivers, whether it's a two-way or three-way configuration, and the speaker's total harmonic distortion rating. Consider how the speaker handles outdoor noise and if it's suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. 


### Battery Life and Power Consumption

Most portable Bluetooth speakers sacrifice sound quality for extended battery life, but the best models strike a good balance. Look for speakers with over 10 hours of playback on a single charge, with fast charging capabilities preferred. Consider whether the speaker has a physical power button or auto-off feature to conserve battery when not in use. 


### Bluetooth Connectivity and Features

Modern portable speakers prioritize Bluetooth connectivity while maintaining audio jack compatibility. Essential features include multi-device pairing, voice assistant integration, and dedicated controls for play/pause and track skipping. For outdoor use, consider models with built-in Wi-Fi for music streaming or dedicated app control. 


### Build Quality and Durability

Portability doesn't guarantee durability. The best outdoor speakers feature waterproof construction (ideally IP67 rating), dustproofing, and robust materials like rubber or metal. Consider the speaker's size relative to its weight for easy carrying, and look for models with secure strap attachments or handles. 


## FAQ


### What's new in the JBL Clip 4 compared to its predecessor?

The most significant difference is the addition of Bluetooth 5.1 with improved connectivity and reduced latency. The speaker also features a more powerful 2.0 peak power and enhanced water resistance at IP67 rating. 

Design changes include a new 360-degree sound projection system and an improved battery life of 12 hours, up from 10 hours in the Clip 3. 


### How long does the JBL Clip 4's battery last?

Up to 12 hours of playback with Bluetooth connectivity, or 15 hours with Wi-Fi casting. The battery recharges via USB-C in approximately 2.5 hours. 

Playtime varies based on volume level and playback method - use Wi-Fi for longer battery life, but Bluetooth for connectivity flexibility. 


### What water resistance rating does the JBL Clip 4 have?

It's rated IP67, meaning it's fully dust-sealed and can handle immersion in water up to 1 meter deep for 30 minutes. 

While water-resistant, thorough cleaning requires removing the speaker's cover and microphone capsule, which can be done under running water. 


### Can the JBL Clip 4 work without Bluetooth?

Yes, it can play music directly from connected devices via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or AUX input (3.5mm jack). 

For non-connected playback, you can use the built-in microphone for hands-free calls or voice assistants.

With a frequency response of 70-20,000 Hz and 2.0 peak power, it produces rich bass and detailed mid-range audio. 


### How far can the Bluetooth connection reach?
