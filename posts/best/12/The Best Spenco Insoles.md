## FAQ

![Spenco-Insoles-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Spenco-Insoles-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What materials are used in Spenco insoles?

Spenco insoles are crafted from high-quality materials designed for comfort and support. The main components include encapsulated gel cushions, breathable moisture-wicking mesh, and multi-density foam layers. These elements work together to reduce pressure points, absorb shock, and keep feet dry during extended wear. 

The cushioning elements contain medical-grade gel that conforms to common pressure points, while the moisture-wicking mesh ensures excellent ventilation. The insoles are available in both EVA (Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate) and Memory Foam constructions, each offering distinct performance characteristics for different foot types and activities. 


### How long do Spenco insoles last?

With regular use, Spenco insoles typically last between 6 months to a year before showing significant wear. This longevity depends on several factors including the frequency of use, the user's weight, and the specific activity level. Regular weight-bearing activities like running or walking will shorten the lifespan compared to casual wear. 

To extend the life of your Spenco insoles, consider using them in a rotation with another pair of insoles. This helps distribute wear evenly and can double their useful life. Additionally, proper fit is crucial - insoles that are too small or too large will wear out faster.

### What problems do Spenco insoles solve?

Spenco insoles address common foot issues by providing targeted support and cushioning. The gel cushions relieve pressure on the ball of the foot, arches, and heels, which are common areas of discomfort. The multi-density foam distributes weight evenly across the foot, reducing hot spots and preventing corns and calluses. 

The insoles also help prevent flat feet by arch support, which can alleviate chronic foot pain. For those with high arches, Spenco offers custom-molded options that maintain the natural arch shape while providing additional support. 


### Can I get Spenco insoles customized?

Yes, Spenco offers custom molded insoles through their medical division, Spenco Medical. These insoles are created using 3D scanning technology that captures the precise contours of your feet, providing superior support for both medical conditions and athletic performance. 

For over-the-counter options, you can use their online sizing tool to determine if their standard molds will be suitable. Custom molded insoles typically offer more personalized support, while the standard molds provide excellent general foot comfort.

### What is the return policy for Spenco insoles?

Spenco offers a 30-day money-back guarantee on all purchases. This means you have 30 days from the date of purchase to return the insoles if you're not satisfied with their performance. The insoles must be returned in their original condition and packaging. 

After the 30-day period, Spenco still accepts returns for defective products within 90 days of purchase. Any issues with manufacturing defects will be replaced at no cost. Customer service is available to assist with returns and exchanges if necessary. 


### How should I care for my Spenco insoles?

Regular care can significantly extend the life of your Spenco insoles. To clean them, remove any loose debris and wash with mild soap and water. Air dry thoroughly before reinserting them into your footwear. It's important to avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, which can damage the materials. 

Store your insoles in a cool, dry place when not in use. If you notice any signs of wear such as flattening of the gel pads or discoloration, it's time to replace them. Proper maintenance ensures long-term comfort and support while reducing the risk of foot pain and injury.
