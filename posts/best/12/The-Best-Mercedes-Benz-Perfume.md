![Mercedes-Benz-Perfume-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Mercedes-Benz-Perfume-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How long do Mercedes-Benz perfumes typically last?

Mercedes-Benz fragrances typically offer a base longevity of 6-8 hours, with significant sillage (the distance a fragrance travels in the air) for the first 30-60 minutes after application. The longevity and strength of the fragrance can vary based on environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and body chemistry. 

While the initial intensity fades, the base notes continue to develop over time, offering lasting dry-down characteristics that can last up to 24 hours when applied correctly. 


### Are Mercedes-Benz perfumes suitable for all skin types?

Mercedes-Benz fragrance formulas are designed to be gentle on various skin types, with most perfumes containing ingredients that help prevent irritation. However, individual sensitivities can vary, so it's recommended to perform a patch test on a small area of skin before full application. 

For those with particularly sensitive skin, Mercedes-Benz offers a hypoallergenic line that uses less potent fragrances and fewer synthetic ingredients to minimize potential irritation.
