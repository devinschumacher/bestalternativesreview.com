## Buyer's Guide

When selecting food for your canine companion, choosing a high-quality diet can significantly impact their overall health and well-being. Dr. Marty's Dog Food offers several varieties specifically tailored to different life stages and health needs of dogs. Here's what you need to consider when selecting the right formula for your pet. 


### Understanding Nutritional Requirements

All dog food formulas should provide a balanced combination of proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. The American Kennel Club recommends that adult dogs receive at least 18% protein and 5% fat in their diet. Puppies, pregnant or lactating dogs, and seniors may require specialized formulas with adjusted nutritional ratios to support their specific needs. 


### Identifying Quality Ingredients

Top-quality dog foods use real meat as the primary ingredient, followed by whole grains and vegetables. Avoid products containing artificial preservatives, colors, or flavors. The ingredient list should clearly show a named meat source, such as "chicken meal" or "beef, " rather than vague terms like "meat by-products. "


### Considering Specific Health Needs

Dr. Marty's offers formulas designed for weight management, joint health, digestive support, and sensitivity diets. If your dog has allergies or digestive issues, look for formulas labeled "hypoallergenic" or containing specific ingredients like chicken or rice. Consult with your veterinarian to determine if a specialized formula is necessary for your pet's health condition. 


### Reviewing Packaging and Storage

The packaging should indicate the product's shelf life and storage requirements. Most canned and dry dog foods have a best-by date, typically 1-2 years from production. Store opened cans in the refrigerator and use within 3-5 days. Unopened dry food should be kept in a cool, dry place to maintain optimal freshness. 


## FAQ

### What are Dr Marty's key ingredients?

Each recipe features high-quality protein sources like grass-fed beef, organic turkey, or wild-caught salmon. They also incorporate nutrient-dense ingredients such as sweet potatoes, carrots, and blueberries, providing essential vitamins and antioxidants.

### How does Dr Marty's dog food support health?

The limited-ingredient formulas are designed to identify and address food sensitivities, while the therapeutic diets target specific health conditions like kidney disease or skin allergies. 


### What is the serving size recommendation?

The recommended serving size varies based on the pet's weight and activity level. As a general guideline, the package recommends feeding 3-4% of the dog's body weight per day, divided into two meals. 

Always adjust the serving size based on your pet's individual needs and consult with a veterinarian to determine the appropriate portion size for your dog's specific situation. 


### Can Dr Marty's dog food be used for weight loss?
