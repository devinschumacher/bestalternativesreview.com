## Buyer's Guide

When selecting the right luggage for your travels, it's important to consider several key factors that will ensure your bags meet both your needs and the requirements of airlines and travel destinations. This guide outlines essential features and considerations to help you choose the perfect piece of luggage for your next trip. 


### Size and Dimension

Measure your bags against airline requirements for carry-on and checked luggage. Consider the shape and internal dimensions, as some luggage designs can pack more efficiently than others. The typical carry-on size is 22 inches by 14 inches by 9 inches, while checked luggage usually has a maximum dimension of 62 inches across all three dimensions combined. 


### Construction and Durability

The quality of materials significantly impacts luggage longevity. Look for durable fabrics like ballistic nylon or polyester with reinforced stitching, especially around stress points like handles and wheels. Suitcases constructed with aluminum, composite materials, or reinforced frames offer better protection against dents and damage during transit. 


### Wheeling and Mobility

Rolling luggage with four wheels (two on each end) generally offers smoother mobility than three-wheeled models. Full swivel wheels at the front improve maneuverability in tight spaces. Check that the wheels are securely mounted and the bag has a solid base to prevent tipping during use. 


### Security and Locking

Choose luggage with at least one TSA-approved combination lock to secure your contents. Look for bags with multiple lockable features like zippers and case locks to enhance overall security. The exterior of the bag should also have a clear, matching lock marking for easy identification during security checks.
