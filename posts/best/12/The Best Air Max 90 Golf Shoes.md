### What makes the Air Max 90 Golf Shoe different from regular Air Max 90s?

The Air Max 90 Golf Shoe incorporates specialized golf-specific features, including an offset heel design for improved stability during your golf swing, a more flexible midsole construction for enhanced feel of the ground, and a redesigned outsole pattern optimized for golf footwear. 

While maintaining the classic Air Max 90 aesthetic, these golf-specific modifications help golfers maintain their balance and improve their swing quality without the bulk typically associated with traditional spike-style golf shoes. 


### How does the Air Max 90 Golf Shoe compare to other golf-specific footwear options?

Compared to traditional spike-style golf shoes, the Air Max 90 Golf Shoe offers a more modern design with reduced bulk while maintaining necessary stability features. It sits between traditional spikes and contemporary golf footwear that emphasize minimalist design.

### Is the Air Max 90 Golf Shoe suitable for all golfers?

While the Air Max 90 Golf Shoe excels for players requiring maximum ground feel and stability, its higher top-line design may not suit those preferring an extremely low-profile shoe. It works well for mid-to-high handicap players who value traditional golf shoe features but aren't concerned about extreme weight reduction. 

The shoe's standard women's sizing runs true to size, while men's sizing typically requires half a size down. The extended width sizing option provides a better fit for players needing extra room. 


### What are the key durability features of the Air Max 90 Golf Shoe?

The outsole features a modified herringbone pattern optimized for golf footwear, with increased wear resistance in high-abrasion areas. The midsole construction incorporates dual densities for durability while maintaining responsiveness.

### How should I care for my Air Max 90 Golf Shoes?

Clean the shoes regularly using a soft brush and mild soap solution to remove dirt and grass buildup. Store them in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight to preserve the materials and maintain airflow. 

Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the upper materials and compromise the integrity of the Air Max cushioning. Consider using shoe trees for extended storage to maintain shape and prevent creasing. 


### What is the recommended replacement schedule for Air Max 90 Golf Shoes?

The recommended replacement schedule is typically every 300-500 rounds of golf, depending on playing frequency and conditions. Regular inspection for worn-out soles, loose stitching, and deterioration of the Air Max unit helps determine optimal replacement timing. 

Consider replacing both pairs simultaneously to maintain consistent performance and appearance. For players who use their shoes less frequently or in optimal conditions, the lifespan may extend beyond the recommended range.
