The Bernat Velvet Stripes Yarn combines softness with a luxurious drape, making it perfect for creating cozy home accessories like pillows and blankets. The double-knitting construction holds up well to regular use, though some projects may require careful attention to maintain their shape. Overall, the quality of the yarn is mixed – while it excels in feel, it falls short in areas like color consistency and washability.

Knitting with the Bernat Baby Velvet yarn feels like hugging a cloud – each strand is so soft it's hard to believe it's 100% polyester.

## FAQ


### What is Bernat Velvet Plus Yarn?

Bernat Velvet Plus Yarn is a soft, plush polyester blend that creates warm, cuddly projects with a luxurious feel. Made from 40% cotton and 60% polyester, this medium-weight yarn combines durability with rich texture. 

This versatile yarn comes in a wide array of colors and works well for blankets, pillows, and casual garments. It's available in bulk quantities and features a light texture suitable for both beginners and experienced knitters and crocheters. 


### What makes Bernat Velvet Plus Yarn unique?

Bernat Velvet Plus Yarn stands out for its soft, slightly fuzzy surface that adds warmth without extra weight. The blend of cotton and polyester provides a balance between natural breathability and synthetic durability. 

Unlike some soft yarns that can felt or shrink, this blend maintains its shape and size even when washed. The medium weight makes it ideal for projects that need substance but won't be worn next to the skin. 


### How does Bernat Velvet Plus Yarn perform in different projects?

For knitting, Bernat Velvet Plus works well in patterns that appreciate texture and mild durability, such as afghans, scarves, and lightweight sweaters. The medium weight makes it suitable for most casual knitting projects. 

Crocheters will find this yarn works great for blankets, coasters, and dishcloths. It's particularly ideal for projects that need a soft surface but don't require the intense durability of bulky yarns. 


### What care instructions should I follow?

Using a gentle cycle with cold water, Bernat Velvet Plus Yarn can be machine washed for convenience. However, it's recommended to wash similar colors together and avoid mixing with items that have stiffeners or metallic elements. 

The yarn should be air-dried to maintain its shape and texture. For best results, reshape items while they're still slightly damp and lay them flat to dry. This helps maintain the softness and prevents stretching. 


### What should I consider when buying Bernat Velvet Plus?

When selecting colors, keep in mind that the slightly variegated nature of the yarn can create an interesting effect in project knitting or crocheting. This property makes it perfect for textured patterns that benefit from subtle color variations. 

While the yarn is generally colorfast, some lighter shades may bleed slightly during the first wash. It's best to test a small swatch before starting your main project. The blend's durability means it performs well over time, though darker colors may show wear more readily than light shades. 


### Can I use Bernat Velvet Plus with other yarns?

Yes, Bernat Velvet Plus Yarn can be combined with other medium-weight yarns for interesting texture effects. When mixing colors, consider using it with lighter yarns for contrast or with similar weight yarns for uniform projects. 

However, avoid mixing it with significantly different weights, as this can affect the final project's drape and structure. The polyester content makes it stable when combined with natural fibers, but always test a small sample to ensure compatibility.
