## Buyer's Guide

A money lock box is a secure storage solution specifically designed to protect cash, jewelry, important documents, and other valuable items. These locks offer a combination of physical security features and advanced locking mechanisms to deter theft and unauthorized access. 


### Physical Security Features

When selecting a lock box, start by examining its physical construction. Look for models made from durable materials like stainless steel or heavy-duty plastic with reinforced hinges and doors. The box should have a secure latch or snap-lock mechanism to prevent forced entry. 


### Combination Lock Options

Most money lock boxes feature combination locks, allowing you to set your own unique passcode for access. Consider a model with at least a 20-digit combination pad to create a more complex code. Some advanced options offer split-lock mechanisms, where the code requires entry from both sides of the box. 


### Size and Portability

Measure your intended storage space and select a lock box that matches. Common sizes range from small (suitcase) to extra-large (filing cabinet). If you need to move the box regularly, consider models with wheels or a handle for easy transport. 


### Additional Security Enhancements

Some lock boxes include secondary security features like dual-lock mechanisms, built-in alarm systems, or biometric scanners. The alarm can detect unauthorized attempts to open the box and trigger a loud alarm or signal. Biometric options use fingerprint recognition for added access control. 


## FAQ


### What is a money lock box?

A money lock box is a secure storage device designed to protect small valuables, including cash, jewelry, and important documents. It features a tamper-evident mechanism and often includes features like multiple locks for additional security. 

These boxes come in various sizes and materials, from basic plastic models to premium stainless steel containers, offering flexibility based on your storage needs and budget. 


### How secure are money lock boxes?

Most money lock boxes offer basic to moderate security through mechanical locks and resistant materials like plastic or metal. Higher-end models include multiple locking mechanisms, biometric features, or military-grade sealing. 

While they provide excellent protection against theft and damage, money lock boxes are not immune to forced entry. Always use multiple locks and consider additional security measures for extremely valuable items. 


### What materials are money lock boxes made from?

Entry-level money lock boxes are typically made from impact-resistant plastic or ABS, providing basic protection against physical damage. Mid-range models feature durable metal construction, often stainless steel, which offers better protection and longer-lasting security. 

Premium lock boxes may incorporate ballistic-grade materials or specialized coatings to resist high-velocity impacts and penetration attempts. 


### Can money lock boxes protect against fire?

Standard money lock boxes are not designed to withstand fire and will melt or deform when exposed to high temperatures. For fire protection, consider specialized safes or lock boxes designed specifically for residential or commercial use. 

Fire-resistant lock boxes incorporate thicker metal walls, protective coatings, and specialized door gaskets to contain heat and maintain integrity during a fire event. 


### How do money lock boxes keep items dry?

Most money lock boxes maintain a dry internal environment through basic sealing techniques. They typically feature airtight lids and elastic seals that prevent water intrusion, keeping contents dry in normal household conditions. 

Higher-end models include additional features like desiccant packs, water-resistant coatings, or completely sealed compartments to prevent moisture damage. 


### What size money lock box should I get?

Measure your items before selecting a lock box to ensure they will fit comfortably inside without excess empty space. Common sizes range from small jewelry boxes to medium lockers, so consider the total volume of items you need to store. 

Keep storage needs and accessibility in mind. A larger box may be necessary if you frequently add new items, but remember that smaller sizes often offer better security per square inch.
