## Buyer's Guide

Momcozy pumps are popular breast pump options, offering various features to accommodate different needs. Understanding key aspects helps in selecting an appropriate model for your pumping routine. 


### Power Options

Consider whether you need a manual pump for basic scenarios or an electric pump for consistent, efficient milk removal. Electric pumps are handy for home use but require charging, while manual pumps offer portability but take more arm strength. 


### Closure Systems

The pump's closure system affects milk flow and maintenance. Pre-assembled systems are convenient but may need regular sanitization, while open systems allow for quick cleaning but demand careful handling to prevent contamination. 


### Stimulation Features

Look for pumps that mimic natural feeding rhythms, which can enhance milk production. Effective stimulation features include adjustable suction levels and timed pumping cycles that help stimulate the letdown reflex. 


### Compatibility and Accessories

Ensure the pump's compatible parts, such as flanges and collection sets, match your needs. Some pumps offer extensive accessory options for different feeding situations, while basic models provide minimal components.
