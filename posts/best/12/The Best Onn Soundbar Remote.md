## FAQ


### What features does the Onn soundbar remote have?

Standard Onn soundbar remotes include basic features like volume adjustment, play/pause control, and input selection. Some models offer additional controls for track skipping and source switching. 

Higher-end models may feature more advanced functions such as sleep timer control, equalizer settings, and built-in music controls for smart assistants and streaming services. 


### How does the Onn soundbar remote connect to my TV or soundbar?

Most Onn soundbar remotes use infrared (IR) technology to send commands to your TV or soundbar. Ensure your TV or soundbar's IR port is visible and aligned with the remote's sensor. 

Some newer models support Bluetooth connectivity for paired devices. This allows you to control your soundbar without line-of-sight requirements but requires a compatible TV or soundbar. 


### Is the Onn soundbar remote compatible with all TV brands?

Standard IR remotes work with most major TV brands, including Sony, LG, Samsung, and Panasonic. The remote's manufacturer compatibility list should include your specific TV model. 

Bluetooth connectivity is generally universal among TV brands, but check your TV's Bluetooth version compatibility with the remote. 


### How far can the Onn soundbar remote control my TV or soundbar?

The maximum control distance typically ranges from 20 to 30 feet (6 to 9 meters), though this can vary based on room layout and obstructions. Ensure there are no physical barriers between the TV/soundbar and the control path. 

Bluetooth range usually extends to about 30 feet (9 meters) but is typically much shorter in practice, around 10 to 15 feet (3 to 4.5 meters) indoors. 


### Can I use the Onn soundbar remote to control my smart TV features?

Standard Onn soundbar remotes control basic TV functions like volume and input selection. Smart TV features such as app launching and navigation require a compatible smart remote or a third-party app. 

Some Onn soundbar remotes include voice command capabilities that can control smart TV features. Check your specific model's features for compatibility with your smart TV's ecosystem. 


### How do I program the Onn soundbar remote to work with my TV or soundbar?

For IR remotes, align the remote's sensor window with your TV or soundbar's IR port. Press and hold the setup button on the remote until the indicator light turns on, then press and hold the TV or soundbar's power button.
