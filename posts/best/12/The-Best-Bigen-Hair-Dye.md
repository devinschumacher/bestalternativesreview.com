## Buyer's Guide

Bigen hair dye offers a versatile range of colors and styles for natural hair dyeing. When selecting a Bigen hair dye product, consider the type of hair you have, the desired color intensity, and the longevity of the color. The dye formula usually combines powdered colorant with a developing agent and peroxide to achieve the desired results. 


### Color Selection and Shading

Bigen dyes provide a wide palette for both primary and secondary colors. The selection includes natural hair tones, vibrant pastels, and bold metallic shades. To achieve accurate results, compare the color guides provided and consider testing a small patch before full application. The brand offers various shadings and highlights to customize your color look. 


### Dye Application and Development

The dye application process typically involves mixing the color powder with developer and peroxide according to the instructions. Natural hair requires a higher developer strength for optimal results. Process time varies based on the color intensity desired and the natural hair color. Factors like scalp health and hair texture can affect the outcome and longevity of the dye. 


### Aftercare and Maintenance

Proper aftercare ensures the best results and minimizes potential scalp irritation. Rinse the dyed hair thoroughly with water, then apply a dye-specific conditioner followed by a deep conditioner for damaged or chemically treated hair. Use sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners to preserve the color. The dye washes out with regular hair care, and touch-ups are recommended every four to six weeks for optimal color retention. 


### Swapping for Natural Options

For those transitioning to natural hair care, Bigen offers products that can be phased out gradually. Start by using the dye less frequently or mixing it with natural colorants. Always perform patch tests with any new product to check for allergic reactions. The dye can be replaced with natural alternatives like henna or vegetable-based dyes, but results vary and may not match chemical dyes in intensity.

For best results, follow the product instructions and consider touch-ups every 4-6 weeks to maintain the original color intensity. 


### Is Bigen hair dye suitable for all hair types?

Bigen hair dye is formulated for all hair types, including curly, straight, fine, and thick hair. Their products are designed to work effectively across different hair structures. 

However, individuals with severe scalp conditions or allergies should perform a patch test before use. Always consult with a dermatologist if you have specific concerns about hair dye compatibility. 


### How do I prepare my hair before using Bigen hair dye?

Before coloring, thoroughly wash your hair with a gentle shampoo and conditioner, then rinse it completely. Pat your hair dry with a towel, avoiding excessive moisture. 

Apply a leave-in conditioner or hair serum before dyeing to protect your hair cuticles and maintain shine during the coloring process. 


### Can I mix different Bigen hair dye shades?

Bigen recommends using their products as single shades for the best results, unless specified otherwise in their instructions. Mixing multiple shades can affect the final color and consistency. 

If you're looking to create custom shades, it's best to test the mixture on a small section of hair first to ensure the desired outcome. 


### What aftercare products are recommended for Bigen hair dye?

After coloring, use a moisturizing hair mask or deep conditioner once a week to maintain hair health and prevent dryness. 

Avoid using harsh chemicals, tight hairstyles, and excessive heat styling for 24-48 hours after dye application to allow the color to set properly.
