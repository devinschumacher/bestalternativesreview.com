## FAQ

![Ballistol-Gun-Cleaner-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Ballistol-Gun-Cleaner-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What sets Ballistol apart from other gun cleaners?

Ballistol is unique in its dual-action formula, combining degreaser and lubricant in one product. This comprehensive approach ensures both cleaning and protection during the same process. 

Unlike traditional solvents that can warp plastics and damage finishes, Ballistol is formulated to safely clean and protect all gun components without residue or contamination. 


### Can Ballistol be used on all types of firearms?

Yes, Ballistol is suitable for use on all types of firearms, including pistols, rifles, shotguns, and airguns. Its universal compatibility makes it a versatile choice for any firearm maintenance routine. 

However, it's always advisable to test on an inconspicuous area first, as rare reactions can occur. Follow specific manufacturer guidelines for your firearm model. 

![Ballistol-Gun-Cleaner-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Ballistol-Gun-Cleaner-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How does Ballistol protect firearms?

Ballistol creates a thin, invisible protective layer on metal surfaces while remaining non-greasy and non-conductive. This helps prevent corrosion and rust while allowing free movement of parts. 

The product's natural properties also help repel water and moisture, providing additional protection in humid environments or storage conditions. 


### What components of a firearm can Ballistol be used on?

Ballistol can be used on all metal firearm components, including barrels, slides, bolts, and springs. It's also safe for use on plastic parts and finishes without causing damage or residue. 

For best results, avoid applying Ballistol directly to the firing pin or other moving parts that require regular lubrication. Spot treat these areas with a small amount of specialized lubricant instead. 

![Ballistol-Gun-Cleaner-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Ballistol-Gun-Cleaner-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can Ballistol be used on non-firearm metals?

Ballistol is designed specifically for firearm components and may not perform optimally on other metals. For general-purpose metal cleaning and protection, consider alternative products designed for broader use. 

When in doubt, conduct a small-scale test on a non-critical metal surface before widespread application. 


### Is Ballistol safe for decorative finishes?

Ballistol's mild nature makes it safe for use on most decorative finishes, including blackening, bluing, and other surface treatments. It's less aggressive than many commercial cleaners and won't strip finishes. 

For highly decorative or antique firearms, it's recommended to test on an inconspicuous area first to ensure compatibility with your specific finish type.
