### What materials make up the tent structure?

The tent shell is constructed from polyester with a 4000mm water column rating, while the rainfly uses a 900mm coating for additional water resistance. 

The poles are made from lightweight aluminum with a diameter of 1", and the guy lines are 9 mm diameter polyester for stability in various weather conditions.
