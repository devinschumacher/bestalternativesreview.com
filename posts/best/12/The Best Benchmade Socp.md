## Buyer's Guide

Benchmade's SOCP series combines exceptional performance with versatile blade designs, making them a popular choice among outdoor enthusiasts and professionals. Understanding their key features and capabilities can help you select the right SOCP for your needs. 


### Blade Design and Specifications

SOCP blades typically range from 2.7 to 3.3 inches, with weights between 3.1 and 4.1 ounces. Common blade types include Clip-Point, Drop-Point, and Spey, each designed for different cutting tasks. The S30V steel used in these blades offers a balance of durability and edge retention, though some variants feature different steel compositions for specific applications. 


### Handle Construction and Grip

The handle material usually alternates between G10 laminate and Delrin, providing a secure grip through both dry and wet conditions. The G10 section, located where the blade locks into place, offers maximum torque resistance. The ambidextrous design features deep finger grooves and a thumb-rest projection, although right-handed models have a secondary index-finger groove for additional traction. 


### Deployment and Locking Mechanism

All SOCP models use Benchmade's Contrac Lock system, which automatically locks the blade via the blade's tang when it's deployed. The mechanism requires less pressure to open than many other mechanisms, making it intuitive to use. The deployment action is smooth and crisp, with a distinct lock-in-place feel when complete. 


### Additional Features and Construction Quality

SOCP models incorporate several practical features beyond basic functionality. Many versions include lanyard loops, finger-rings, or bottle-openers. The construction quality consistently meets Benchmade's high standards, with precision-machined parts and double-locking mechanisms in premium variants. The overall durability of the series makes it well-suited for frequent use in various environments.

### Can the Benchmade Socp be customized with different handle materials?

Yes, the handle material can be customized to meet specific user preferences. Common options include G10, aluminum, and carbon fiber, each offering different levels of durability and grip texture. 

The handle material can be changed through Benchmade's warranty program or by contacting an authorized dealer for customization services. 


### What is the warranty coverage for the Benchmade Socp?
