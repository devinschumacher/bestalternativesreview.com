Here are key factors to help you choose the perfect graduation present. 


### Understanding the Graduate's Interests and Goals

Research the graduate's hobbies, academic focus, and career aspirations. If he's passionate about technology, consider electronics or coding resources.

Experiences often make memorable gifts that create lasting memories. Options range from travel opportunities within budget constraints to local event tickets or adventure experiences.
