## Buyer's Guide

A Nesco vacuum sealer helps extend the shelf life of food by removing air and moisture, which are major causes of spoilage. These sealers create an airtight seal at the ends of bags or containers, protecting your food and preserving its freshness. 


### Size and Capacity

Consider how much food you plan to store at once. Nesco sealers typically come in sizes that handle quart, half-gallon, or gallon bags. If you're storing large quantities or meat, a larger capacity model might be necessary. 


### Bag Compatibility

Ensure the machine works with your preferred brand of storage bags. Nesco sealers are compatible with standard vacuum-seal bags, and some models can handle thicker freezer bags as well. 


### Power and Operation

Standard models use household electricity, but portable options exist for camping or travel. Check if the sealer requires special accessories like adapters or heating elements for optimum performance. 


### Maintenance and Usage

Basic models require minimal maintenance, with occasional cleaning of the machine and bags. Consider how often you'll use the sealer and if you need features like digital displays or adjustable vacuum settings. 


## FAQ


### What is a vacuum sealer?

A vacuum sealer is an appliance that removes air from sealed containers, typically made of plastic or glass, to create a vacuum seal. This process helps preserve food by reducing exposure to oxygen, which slows down spoilage and prevents freezer burn. 

By creating an airtight seal, vacuum sealers can extend the shelf life of perishable items, protect the flavor and nutrients of foods, and prevent freezer burn, making them useful for meal prep, camping, and long-term food storage. 


### How does a Nesco vacuum sealer work?

Nesco vacuum sealers operate by attaching a special oxygen absorber bag to the machine, which creates a seal. The machine then removes air from the bag, creating a vacuum that displaces the air molecules. The bag is then closed, creating an airtight seal that preserves the contents through reduced oxidation. 

During the sealing process, the vacuum sealer activates heating elements that melt the bag's seals, ensuring a proper airtight closure. The machine works with both food and non-food items, making it versatile for various storage needs. 


### What types of materials can I use with a Nesco vacuum sealer?

Nesco vacuum sealers work best with their proprietary resealable bags, which are specifically designed for the machine's heating element. These bags come in different sizes and styles, including flat bags, stand pouches, and meal containers. 

While Nesco vacuum sealers can work with alternative materials, including ziplock bags and canning jars, the results may not be as effective. Using the recommended materials ensures optimal sealing performance and preservation. 


### How do I clean my Nesco vacuum sealer?

Regular maintenance includes wiping down the exterior with a damp cloth and cleaning the sealing plate with soap and water. The exterior rubber seal should be cleaned after each use to prevent food residue buildup. 

For deeper cleaning, unplug the machine and remove the sealing plate and heating elements. Soak these parts in warm, soapy water, then rinse thoroughly before reassembly. Allow all parts to dry completely before using the machine again. 


### How long do Nesco vacuum sealers typically last?

With regular use and proper maintenance, Nesco vacuum sealers can last 10 years or more. The lifespan depends on factors like usage frequency, maintenance practices, and whether the machine has been properly stored when not in use. 

Common signs that indicate the need for replacement include difficulty sealing bags, uneven heating, or visible damage to the sealing plate. Regular checks for these issues can help identify when the machine needs to be replaced. 


### Can I use a Nesco vacuum sealer with liquids?

While Nesco vacuum sealers can handle liquids, they work best with uncooked or pureed foods, as liquids can prevent proper sealing and increase the risk of leaks during the heating process. For liquids, consider freezing them first in an airtight container before sealing with the vacuum machine. 

Always check the machine's manual for specific guidelines, as some models may have limitations when working with liquids. Using the correct technique and equipment can help prevent sealing failures and ensure proper vacuum sealing.
