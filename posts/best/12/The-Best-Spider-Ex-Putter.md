## Buyer's Guide

A spider expander putter combines a traditional putter design with an adjustable hosel. This simple modification allows golfers to customize their stance and impact position for better performance. The adjustable hosel typically features a screw mechanism that lets you change the lie angle and offset in small increments. 


### Key Features

Most spider expanders include a basic weight adjustment mechanism. Some models offer more advanced features like magnetic alignment aids or built-in putting green targets. The face angle and curvature are similar to standard putters, with options for both straight and slight heel-toe weight distribution. 

![Spider-Ex-Putter-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Spider-Ex-Putter-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Adjustment Range

The hosel adjustment usually allows movement of the face up to 15-20 degrees around the vertical axis. This range gives golfers ample opportunity to find their ideal impact position. High-quality models maintain face stability during adjustment through precise machining and quality control. 


### Material and Construction

Spider expanders typically use stainless steel for durability. Heavier models with more adjustment features might incorporate additional materials like aluminum or plastic for the weight block. The putting face usually features a conventional milling pattern for consistent ball striking.

### Plyometric Considerations

While the adjustable nature of these putters can help some golfers improve their mechanics, there's no scientific evidence that they inherently boost performance. Golfers should focus on proper putting fundamentals and have realistic expectations for their results. 


## FAQ

### What is the Spider Ex Putter?

Available in multiple models to suit different playing styles and preferences, the Spider Ex Putter integrates adjustable weighting for precise alignment and feel customization while maintaining the unmistakable Spider aesthetic. 


### What sets the Spider Ex Putter apart from other putters?

Unlike traditional putters, the Spider Ex utilizes an expanded face design that increases the area around the club's sweet spot. This feature helps players make solid contact more frequently, regardless of their stroke path or impact location. 

The innovative Ex-Face technology is complemented by state-of-the-art weighting systems that allow for personalized customization. Players can adjust the club's balance and face balance to their specific swing characteristics, ensuring optimal feel and performance. 

![Spider-Ex-Putter-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Spider-Ex-Putter-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How does the adjustable weighting system work?

The Spider Ex features a modular weighting system with interchangeable components. These components attach to the grip shaft and sole to allow for precise balance and face balance adjustments. The system enables players to optimize the club's feel and performance based on their swing characteristics and putting preferences. 

There are two primary weighting options: the Pro Fit System and the Face Balance System. The Pro Fit System allows adjustment of overall club balance, while the Face Balance System specifically targets the distribution of weight across the face for improved impact consistency. 


### What models are available in the Spider Ex lineup?

The current Spider Ex lineup includes several models to accommodate different player preferences and needs. The standard Ex model features the company's most advanced face technology while maintaining a traditional blade design. For players seeking more forgiveness, the Ex Max model increases the face area even further. 

The lineup also includes the Ex Tour model, which combines the premium face technology with a more traditional appearance. Additionally, the Ex Short model offers the same technology in a reduced-length option for players who prefer a shorter putter. 

![Spider-Ex-Putter-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Spider-Ex-Putter-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What materials are used in the construction?

The Spider Ex putter bodies are constructed from a high-strength stainless steel alloy that combines durability with weight optimization. The face material is a proprietary steel blend that maximizes flex at impact for increased ball speed. 

High-quality materials are used throughout the construction, including premium stainless steel for the shaft and face components. The grip material is a moisture-absorbing rubber that provides optimal traction and feel during putting. 


### How should I choose the right Spider Ex model?

The primary factor in selecting a Spider Ex model is determining your optimal face angle and lie angle. Most players will use the standard Ex model, while those with a more upright swing might prefer the Ex Max. The Ex Tour model is suitable for players who value aesthetics while maintaining performance. 

For fitting, consider having your local pro shop perform a lie angle measurement. The Pro Fit System allows for grip-length adjustment to accommodate different hand sizes and swing preferences, while the Face Balance System helps optimize impact consistency.
