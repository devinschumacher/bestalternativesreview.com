![Epiphone Les Paul Standard '60s | Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ6-7-H\_7IhK801TZTl7e2CZrZACSbiNLIS\_ft99hWlFcSFGp90rEYMlcaCJIkbhuur8juNE2g0obuwHTLhES1A4bzcyuhv&usqp=CAY)

### [Epiphone '59 Les Paul Standard Aged Honey Burst](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Epiphone+Les+Paul+Studio?utm\_term=epiphone-59-les-paul-standard-aged-honey-burst)

![Epiphone '59 Les Paul Standard Aged Honey Burst | Image](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcQi884yLKNd18ec04M1laFZXGweD0uGJDDut5pvW1pmIh-kF33bxDjmQeRI4Pn0V99jSiInhWQ4yt0\_H38gRkpJV7iSa33OuQ&usqp=CAY)

### [Epiphone Les Paul Special-I Electric Guitar](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Epiphone+Les+Paul+Studio?utm\_term=epiphone-les-paul-special-i-electric-guitar)

![Epiphone Les Paul Special-I Electric Guitar | Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcQLpj4QJ8V6b79fGiosGtHRciCSuYkIye9v0PVOwAT9-GLiAQxTF9\_rG85-K-e4VvadEdNO\_c0LFbArYy-GNWmWpEMw\_6ZadIAV3nS1LIg&usqp=CAY)

This affordable yet surprisingly capable Les Paul clone is a decent addition to Epiphone's player-friendly lineup. The guitar's basswood body and bolt-on mahogany neck deliver a warm, traditional Les Paul tone, though some may find the slightly heavier feel different from a classic LP. It's worth noting that while the included Electar 10 amp is small but capable, it lacks the raw power of dedicated practice amps in the same price range. Overall, it's a solid choice for beginners who want a bit of authentic Les Paul character in their first electric, but experienced players might want to look elsewhere for their primary rig.

While it may not match the raw power of a humbucker-equipped Les Paul, the single-coil configuration of this slim-bodied guitar gives it a surprisingly versatile tone that shines through both solid-state and vintage-style amplifiers. The lightweight poplar construction keeps the playing experience nimble and responsive, despite the traditional Les Paul heft. Whether you're a new player just starting out or a collector looking to expand your collection, the Epiphone SL delivers big Les Paul sound without the hefty price tag.

The mahogany body feels surprisingly light at just 7 pounds, while the elegant AAA flame maple top really pops when you play it plugged or unplugged.

## FAQ


### What is the main difference between Epiphone's Les Paul Studio models?

Epiphone's Les Paul Studio series features subtle variations across different models. The Les Paul Studio itself offers a balanced blend of mahogany body and maple neck. The Les Paul Studio Pro adds a humbucking pickup and gold hardware for enhanced performance, while the Les Paul Studio ES incorporates active electronics for added versatility. 

Each model maintains Epiphone's commitment to affordability and genuine Les Paul playability, making them excellent choices for players transitioning from guitars to solid bodies. 


### What is the standard configuration of an Epiphone Les Paul Studio?

The Les Paul Studio typically features an all-mahogany construction with a mahogany neck and rosewood fingerboard. It includes a set of Epiphone's ES-100 single-coil pickups and a Bigsby B2 vibrato bridge. The guitar comes with chrome hardware and a three-way pickup selector switch. 

While basic specifications stay consistent, individual models may introduce slight modifications, such as different finishes or hardware treatments. 


### Can the Les Paul Studio's pickups be upgraded?

The Les Paul Studio's stock pickups can be upgraded, though the process requires professional expertise and specialized tools. Replacing the ES-100s with other single-coil pickups is common, while higher-end models might benefit from humbuckers. 

Epiphone offers a range of replacement parts through their official website and select dealers, making it relatively straightforward to customize the guitar's tone. 


### What maintenance does an Epiphone Les Paul Studio require?

Regular maintenance for an Epiphone Les Paul Studio includes cleaning the guitar's surface, checking the strings for sharp edges, and ensuring the neck stays properly intonated. It's important to keep the fretboard free from debris and check the bridge and tuning machines for proper function. 

The guitar should be stored in a soft case to prevent dings and scratches, and the neck should be cleaned and conditioned periodically to maintain its playing comfort and ease of setup. 


### What are the typical setup requirements for a new Les Paul Studio?

When setting up a new Les Paul Studio, professionals recommend checking the intonation, setting the action to your preferred playing style, and ensuring proper neck relief. The bridge and tuners should also be adjusted for optimal string tension and stability. 

Many players find it helpful to have a qualified guitar tech adjust their new Les Paul Studio, as the setup process can significantly affect the guitar's playability and tone. 


### How durable is the Les Paul Studio compared to other solid-body guitars?

The Les Paul Studio's mahogany construction provides decent durability, though the solid body design makes it more susceptible to dents and scratches compared to thinner-bodied guitars. The wood used in Epiphone's construction is generally of good quality for its price point. 

Players should take care to protect their guitar from falls and impacts, as solid-body construction means damage can be more extensive than with hollow or chambered guitars.
