## FAQ


### What is Style Edit Root Touch Up?

Style Edit root touch up is a professional hair coloring service designed to naturally blend gray roots with existing hair color, masking any harsh lines or visible regrowth. The process involves careful application techniques to create a seamless transition between your roots and the surrounding hair color. 

This service is particularly beneficial for maintaining a consistent color appearance without requiring frequent full-color application. The Style Edit method focuses on precision and natural-looking results, making it suitable for all hair types and color levels. 


### Who is Suitable for Style Edit Root Touch Up?

Style Edit root touch up is recommended for individuals who want to extend the duration between full color services while maintaining a natural appearance. It's particularly effective for those with lighter hair colors that show noticeable regrowth, as well as for clients with varying hair densities or fine hair types. 

The procedure is suitable for all hair types, including chemically treated hair, but results may vary depending on individual hair characteristics and maintenance routines. Clients with darker hair colors or those who color their hair infrequently may not require this service. 


### What Can I Expect During the Appointment?

The appointment typically lasts between 1-2 hours, depending on the client's hair length and regrowth. During the process, your stylist will carefully evaluate your hair and scalp to determine the best application technique, ensuring a natural-looking result. 

The service includes a thorough cleanse of the scalp, application of a protective mask (if needed), and precise coloring of the visible gray roots. The entire process is designed to minimize any discomfort or irritation. 


### How Long Does Style Edit Root Touch Up Last?

Style Edit root touch up typically lasts between 4-6 weeks, depending on individual hair growth patterns and maintenance routines. The process creates a gradual transition between your roots and existing color, allowing for more extended coverage compared to traditional root touch ups. 

To maintain the best results, it's recommended to schedule regular touch ups every 4-6 weeks, though this may vary based on your specific hair characteristics and lifestyle factors. 


### What Maintenance is Required After the Service?

Avoid excessive sun exposure and harsh chemicals for the first 24-48 hours after the service to allow the color to settle properly. Regular shampooing is recommended, but severe heat styling or chemical processing should be avoided until the color is fully established. 

To maintain the natural appearance, regular touch ups are recommended every 4-6 weeks. Proper hair care routines, including gentle styling and regular conditioning, will help preserve the color's longevity and appearance. 


### Are There Any Potential Side Effects?

Most clients experience minimal side effects, though some may notice mild scalp irritation or redness after the service. These reactions are usually temporary and can be managed with over-the-counter remedies. 

While rare, it's possible to experience color oxidation or uneven results if the service is not performed correctly. To minimize risks, select a reputable salon with experienced stylists who specialize in precision hair coloring techniques.
