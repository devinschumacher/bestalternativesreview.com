## FAQ

![Clorox-Stain-Remover-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Clorox-Stain-Remover-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What types of stains can Clorox Stain Remover effectively remove?

Clorox Stain Remover excels at removing protein-based stains like blood, grass, and coffee, as well as oil-based stains from cooking and automotive fluids. It's effective on a variety of fabrics including cotton, polyester, and blends, but may not work on delicate fabrics like silk or wool. 

For best results, treat stains immediately and follow pretreatment instructions on the product label. The remover works best when applied directly to the stain and left in place for 2-5 minutes before washing. 


### How does Clorox Stain Remover compare to other popular stain removers?

When compared to other leading stain removers, Clorox Stain Remover consistently ranks high in performance and effectiveness, particularly for protein and oil-based stains. It's often preferred for its quick-acting formula and broad range of stain removal capabilities. 

While some specialized stain removers may excel at removing particular types of stains that Clorox doesn't address, the Clorox product remains a versatile choice for common household stains. 

![Clorox-Stain-Remover-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Clorox-Stain-Remover-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can Clorox Stain Remover be used on all fabrics?

Clorox Stain Remover is suitable for most common fabrics, including cotton, polyester, and blends, but should be tested on inconspicuous areas before use on colored fabrics or dark clothing. The product may damage delicate fabrics like silk, wool, or any fabric with decorative treatments. 

Avoid using it on natural materials like leather, suede, or certain types of upholstery unless specifically noted on the label as safe for those materials. 


### What's the difference between Clorox Stain Remover and Clorox 2?

Clorox Stain Remover and Clorox 2 both effectively remove stains, but Clorox 2 includes bleach to whiten clothes while removing stains. Clorox Stain Remover does not contain bleach and is suitable for all colors, including whites that you prefer to air bleach. 

Clorox 2 is recommended for heavily soiled white clothing and situations where whitening is desired, while Clorox Stain Remover provides versatile stain removal without the whitening effect. 

![Clorox-Stain-Remover-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Clorox-Stain-Remover-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)

Store Clorox Stain Remover in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat sources. The product should be kept out of reach of children and pets. If stored properly, it remains effective for up to two years from the date of purchase. 

Avoid freezing the product, as it contains water-based ingredients that may become ineffective when frozen. If your region experiences extreme cold, consider keeping it in a warmer location when temperatures drop below freezing. 


### Are there any environmental concerns with Clorox Stain Remover?

Like many household cleaning products, Clorox Stain Remover contains ingredients that could impact the environment if not used properly. Always follow proper disposal guidelines and avoid rinsing the product into storm drains or waterways. 

The product is designed for single-use applications and should be stored in its original container with the lid tightly closed. Consult local waste management guidelines for proper disposal of product containers and unused product.
