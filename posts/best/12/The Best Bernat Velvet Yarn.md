## Buyer's Guide

Bernat Velvet yarn creates soft, textured projects that feel wonderful to the touch. Understanding its properties and requirements helps in selecting the right project and care methods. 


### Yarn Weight and Fiber Composition

Bernat Velvet comes in a medium weight (4) category, making it suitable for various projects like blankets, throw pillows, and plush toys. The primary fiber content is acrylic with a velvet texture achieved through special spinning techniques, creating a warm, luxurious feel without the bulk of natural fibers. 


### Sizing and Yardage

Each skein contains approximately 145 yards and weights 5.6 ounces, making it ideal for smaller projects. Projects requiring more than 500 yards will need multiple skeins, so plan accordingly to avoid mid-project color changes. 


### Care Instructions

Mmachine wash cold with similar colors and tumble dry on low. Avoid ironing unless necessary, as the velvet texture can show press marks. Store unused portions loose in their original storage bag to maintain their softness. 


### Project Considerations

Handle the yarn carefully as the velvet texture can flatten easily. Use mediumgaud needles (US 5-7) with an appropriate stitch pattern to maintain the fabric's structure. Working in the round requires extra attention to prevent stretching or pooling. 


## FAQ


### What is Bernat Velvet Yarn?

Bernat Velvet Yarn is a soft, luxurious yarn made from a blend of polyester and rayon. It features a distinctive velvet texture that gives your projects a rich, plush appearance. 

The yarn comes in a wide variety of colors, and its weight classification is medium (size 4), making it suitable for many different types of projects, including blankets, scarves, and home decor items. 


### How is Bernat Velvet Yarn different from other yarns?

Beyond its distinctive velvet texture, Bernat Velvet Yarn stands out due to its consistent color distribution and superior durability. Unlike some soft yarns that can shed, this blend maintains its color and shape well. 

Its polyester content allows it to maintain its shape better than pure wool yarns, while the rayon provides that signature softness and drape. 


### What projects are best suited for Bernat Velvet Yarn?

Projects that benefit most from this yarn's texture include blankets, scarves, hats, and any items where texture and warmth are desired. Its medium weight makes it ideal for Afghan patterns and warm accessories.

### What needle or hook sizes work best with Bernat Velvet Yarn?
