Six elegant drawers offer plenty of storage space for clothes and accessories in this contemporary dresser. The mirrored surface adds a touch of luxury to your bedroom, while the sturdy construction helps prevent tipping. However, some customers have found the drawers to be difficult to open and the overall quality to be disappointing. 


## Buyer's Guide

A mirrored chest of drawers combines practical storage with reflective elegance, making it a versatile addition to any room. These pieces maximize space while maintaining clean lines and reflective surfaces that seem to double the available light. 


### Size and Space Considerations

When selecting a mirrored chest of drawers, measure your available space carefully. The piece should fit comfortably in your designated area, with proper clearance for opening drawers and moving around. Consider the room's overall size and style when choosing between different sizes – from compact options for smaller spaces to larger pieces for spacious rooms. 


### Mirroring Options

Mirrors can be placed on one or both doors, and the size and positioning affect the piece's functionality and visual impact. Single-mirrored doors are excellent for saving weight and maintaining stability, while double-mirrored designs create a more dramatic presence but may require careful placement to prevent glare. 

Consider the mirror's framing and finish to ensure it complements your existing décor. Recessed mirrors with ornate frames add visual interest, while simpler frames maintain a modern aesthetic. 


### Storage Design

The internal design of mirrored chests of drawers varies, with some featuring shallow, decorative compartments and others offering deep, practical storage. Look for pieces with adjustable shelves or multiple depth options to maximize versatility. 

Storage quality is crucial – choose chests with solid construction and smooth gliding drawers for lasting performance. The number of drawers should match your needs, with three to six being common for standard pieces. 


### Maintenance Requirements

Mirrored surfaces require regular care to maintain their appearance. Damp cloths with mild soap are suitable for cleaning, while avoiding harsh chemicals that can damage the finish. Check the manufacturer's recommendations for specific care instructions.
