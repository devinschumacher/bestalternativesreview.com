## FAQ


### What is a stand-alone dishwasher?

A stand-alone dishwasher is a washing machine specifically designed for dishware, including dishes, glasses, and silverware. Unlike built-in dishwashers that require installing cabinets, these units sit on the counter, making them suitable for apartments, small kitchens, or as replacements for older machines. 

They typically feature full-size capacities similar to other dishwashers, with customizable settings for different wash cycles, energy savings options, and child-safe locks. The design comes with modern aesthetics and space-saving features, perfect for various kitchen setups. 


### What are the main benefits of a stand-alone dishwasher?

These dishwashers save time by automatically washing dishes, freeing up your daily routine. They also consume less water and energy per cycle compared to handwashing, making them environmentally friendly. Modern models come with features like adjustable racks, extra-long cycles for tough grime, and quiet operation for late-night use. 

Installation is straightforward, requiring only standard plumbing connections. Their compact profile doesn't occupy valuable counter space, making them ideal for small kitchen layouts or kitchen renovations where space is limited. 


### How much water and electricity do stand-alone dishwashers use?

On average, modern stand-alone dishwashers use 4-6 gallons of water per cycle, significantly less than the 15-25 gallons typically used for handwashing. Most models have Energy Star ratings, with efficient machines using around 0.5 kWh per cycle and modern dishwashers using less than 1 kWh. 

Water heaters contribute significantly to energy usage, with electric water heaters costing about 12 cents per cycle and gas heaters costing 7 cents. Using a dishwasher instead of handwashing can save 1,400 gallons of water per year per household. 


### What features should I consider when choosing a stand-alone dishwasher?

Key features include energy and water efficiency ratings, cycle options for different dishes and soiling levels, and rack configurations for optimal loading. Temperature control, detergent dispensers, and child locking mechanisms enhance usability and safety. 

Smart features like remote monitoring via apps, delayed start times, and specialized cycles for delicate items expand functionality. Consider noise levels for nighttime use and warranty coverage for long-term reliability. 


### Are stand-alone dishwashers difficult to install?

Installation is relatively simple for most models, requiring basic tools and following standard plumbing connections. Many units come with detailed installation guides and are designed for self-installation. 

However, proper installation ensures optimal performance and safety. If you're unsure about the process, consider hiring a professional plumber or appliance installer to handle the installation. 


### What maintenance is required for a stand-alone dishwasher?

Regular maintenance includes monitoring water pressure, checking seals, and cleaning the filter monthly. The dishwasher should be run empty with vinegar once a month for optimal performance and removal of built-up minerals. 

Additionally, check the dishwasher's feet annually to ensure proper leveling and smooth operation. Regular cleaning of the exterior and interior surfaces helps maintain the appliance's longevity and appearance.
