## FAQ


### What is Liquid Lipo?

Liquid Lipo, short for Liquid Lipolysis, is a non-invasive cosmetic treatment that combines radiofrequency and topical lipolytic ingredients to reduce fat deposits and improve skin texture. It works by heating fat cells to induce apoptosis (cell death) while the lipolytic ingredients help dissolve triglycerides inside these cells. 

The procedure typically takes 30-60 minutes per session and requires multiple treatments spaced several weeks apart for optimal results. The number of sessions needed varies based on the treatment area and individual response. 


### What areas can be treated with Liquid Lipo?

Liquid Lipo can effectively target multiple body areas, including the abdomen, love handles, hips, thighs, arms, and double chin. The treatment is particularly effective on localized fat deposits that haven't responded well to diet and exercise. 

It's important to note that the treatment works best on subcutaneous fat, which is the fat just beneath the skin. Areas with significant deep fat, such as the stomach or hips, may not see dramatic results and could need additional procedures like traditional liposuction. 


### How long do the results last?

The results of Liquid Lipo are generally long-lasting, provided you maintain a healthy lifestyle with proper nutrition and exercise. Initial sessions typically produce noticeable improvements within 2-4 weeks, with optimal results achieved after 6-12 weeks. 

However, the body continues to produce fat cells throughout life. To maintain your results, it's essential to keep your weight stable and continue with regular exercise and a healthy diet. 


### What should I expect during the treatment?

During the procedure, you'll lie on a treatment table while a technician applies a conductive gel to the treatment area. The technician then uses a handheld device to apply radiofrequency heat while manually massaging the area. The process usually feels warm and therapeutic, though some patients report mild discomfort. 

The session includes a series of passes across the treatment area to ensure even heating. Between passes, the technician might adjust the radiofrequency settings or move the device to different angles. The treatment area may feel slightly warm and tingly during the procedure. 


### Who is a good candidate for Liquid Lipo?

Liquid Lipo is suitable for individuals who are within 15-20% of their ideal body weight and have localized fat deposits that haven't responded to diet and exercise. The procedure works best on individuals with elastic skin that can shrink after fat removal. 

People with significant deep fat, severe skin laxity, or active skin conditions like eczema or psoriasis may not be ideal candidates. Pregnant women, those with certain medical conditions, and those taking specific medications should consult their doctor before undergoing treatment. 


### What are the potential risks and side effects?

The most common side effects of Liquid Lipo include temporary redness, swelling, and minor bruising at the treatment site. These typically resolve within 24-48 hours. Some patients may experience mild to moderate pain, stiffness, or muscle spasms during the procedure. 

Rare serious complications can occur, including infection, nerve damage, and skin burns. To minimize risks, choose a qualified provider with proper equipment and follow all pre- and post-treatment instructions. If you experience persistent pain, excessive swelling, or other concerning symptoms, contact your provider immediately.
