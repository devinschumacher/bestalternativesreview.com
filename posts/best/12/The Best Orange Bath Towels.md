### [Hawkins New York Simple Waffle Bath Sheet](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Orange+Bath+Towels?utm\_term=hawkins-new-york-simple-waffle-bath-sheet)

The terracotta Hawkins New York bath sheet adds a warm touch to your bathroom, though it falls short of expectations when it comes to absorbency. Reviewers found the towel to be disappointing, with some noting that it's more decorative than practical for actual use. Despite multiple washes and careful attention to care instructions, the towels proved to be less absorbent than advertised, making them more suitable for display than everyday use.

## Buyer's Guide

Orange bath towels add a pop of color to your bathroom essentials while providing quick-drying warmth after a shower. When selecting these towels, several key factors ensure both quality and practicality. 


### Size and Absorbency

Opt for towels with generous dimensions - typically 30 inches by 60 inches for standard bath towels. Higher absorbency is achieved through thicker yarns or multiple-ply construction. Look for towels with a GSM (grams per square meter) rating of 500 or more for superior water absorption. 


### Fabric Quality and Composition

Cotton is the standard for bath towels, but blended fabrics like polyester-cotton can improve durability and quick-drying properties. Higher-quality towels use long-staple cotton, which resists pill formation and maintains its texture longer than shorter-staple options. 


### Colorfastness and Design

Since orange towels can show wear more readily than white ones, consider options with darker orange bases or patterns that mask minor fading. The dye should resist color bleeding when laundered with other towels. Single-color towels made from single-ply fabric are less likely to show wear. 


### Drying Time and Care Requirements

Orange towels should dry quickly to prevent mold and mildew, so look for options that maintain their shape and texture through repeated use. Towels that retain their volume are less likely to ball up or become misshapen. Choose towels that maintain their shape after each wash, indicating high-quality construction.
