## Buyer's Guide

Amika products offer a range of styling options for curls and waves, from mousse to sea salt spray. Understanding the key features and benefits of each product type will help you choose the right one for your hair type and styling goals. 


### Mousse

Mousse provides light hold and volume while maintaining natural movement and texture. It's ideal for creating beachy waves or adding body to fine hair. Look for mousse formulas that contain natural ingredients like argan oil or shea butter for added moisture and shine. 


### Spray Texture

Spray texturizers offer flexible hold and help control frizz without weighing hair down. These products are particularly effective for refreshing second-day hair or adding texture between washes. Most spray texture products contain alcohol, which helps set the style, but can be drying for sensitive scalps. 


### Hair Gel

Hair gel provides medium to strong hold with natural shine, making it suitable for defined curls and sleek styles. The best gel formulas contain natural humectants like PVP (Polyvinylpyrrolidone) to retain moisture while delivering lasting style. Consider choosing a clear or translucent gel for more natural-looking results. 


### Salt Spray

Salt spray adds texture and volume by mimicking the effects of ocean air on hair. This product type is particularly beneficial for creating beachy waves or voluminous styles. Look for formulas with seaweed extract or natural salt minerals to enhance the styling benefits while maintaining hair health.
