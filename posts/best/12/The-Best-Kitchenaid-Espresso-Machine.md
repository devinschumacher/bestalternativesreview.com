### What features should I look for in a Kitchenaid espresso machine?

Essential features include a brew group that can consistently deliver hot water, a reliable pump, and a drip tray for easy cleaning. 

Additional features like programmable brewing times, pre-infusion capabilities, and automatic shut-off are beneficial for managing coffee making, especially when you're busy. 


### Are Kitchenaid espresso machines easy to maintain?

These machines require minimal maintenance, with weekly cleaning of the drip tray and monthly descaling recommended to maintain optimal performance.

### How does the price compare to other brands?

Kitchenaid espresso machines generally offer similar performance to competitors in the same price range but with the advantage of Kitchenaid's established reputation for durable small appliances. 

While they may not match the feature sets of premium brands like La Marzocco or Slayer, they provide reliable performance at a fraction of the cost. 


### What's the difference between single and double shot capabilities?

Single shot machines are sufficient for personal use, while double shot models allow making two drinks simultaneously, suitable for households or small cafes. 

Most Kitchenaid machines offer at least double shot capability, though professional-grade units may include advanced features like temperature control for each shot size.
