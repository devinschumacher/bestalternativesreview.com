## Buyer's Guide

A wool blanket combines warmth and comfort with a natural fiber choice. Understanding the key aspects of wool blankets will help you select one that meets your needs. 


### Fiber Quality and Origin

Most wool blankets use Australian or New Zealand wool due to its consistent quality. Premium options may include specific breeds like Merino or Suffolk, known for their fineness and insulation properties. Understanding the fiber origin and quality level helps determine the blanket's durability and warmth. 


### Construction and Weight

The blanket's construction affects both its warmth and thickness. Standard options range from light shawls to heavy throw blankets. Consider factors like fiber density, stitch patterns, and whether it's a single-ply or double-ply construction. The weight classification (ultra-light, light, medium, or heavy) determines its versatility for different climates and uses. 


### Care Requirements

Wool blankets need proper care to maintain their quality and shape. Look for blankets that specify machine washability or dry cleaning requirements. The care label should detail recommended water temperatures, washing methods, and drying instructions to help preserve the blanket's integrity. 


### Additional Features

Consider any special features that enhance the blanket's functionality or appearance. Options like a concealed button closure, anti-shrink treatment, or decorative stitching can improve usability. For cuddling with pets, hypoallergenic or dust-mite resistant options may be beneficial. 


## FAQ


### What makes wool blankets special?

Wool blankets combine natural warmth with exceptional durability, making them a prized addition to any bedroom. These blankets are highly resistant to both mildew and dust mites, allowing for extended use without frequent washing. 

The unique insulating properties of wool mean they remain warm when it's cold and stay cool when it's warm. This temperature regulation makes wool blankets ideal for year-round use in various climates. 


### How do I care for my wool blanket?

Wool blankets require gentle care to maintain their shape and quality. Most blankets should be washed monthly using a mild detergent and a wash bag to protect their fibers. Air drying is recommended to preserve their natural elasticity. 

For deep cleaning, professional dry cleaning without chlorine bleach is advisable every six months. Proper care helps maintain the natural resilience and breathability of wool blankets. 


### Are wool blankets suitable for allergy sufferers?

Yes, wool blankets can be an excellent choice for individuals with allergies. The material naturally repels dust mites and inhibits mold and mildew growth, making it less likely to become a breeding ground for allergens. 

Wool's natural static properties also make it uncomfortable for some allergy sufferers. Opting for a hypoallergenic blend or choosing organic wool can enhance comfort for sensitive individuals. 


### How should I store my wool blanket?

When not in use, store your wool blanket unwrapped and loosely rolled to prevent damage from pressure points. If using storage containers, place the blanket in a breathable bag or wrap to prevent moisture buildup. 

Avoid packing wool blankets tightly. Regularly rotate stored blankets and check for signs of moth infestation, maintaining fresh cedar chips can help prevent damage from these pests. 


### Can wool blankets fade or lose color?

Wool blankets are generally resistant to fading when cared for properly. However, exposure to sunlight can cause color changes over time, so it's best to store them in a cool, dark place when not in use. 

Some wool varieties may shed during the first few washes, but this should not affect the blanket's performance. Using color-safe laundry products prevents further dye loss and keeps colors vibrant. 


### What sizes do wool blankets come in?

Standard wool blankets come in twin (66" x 90"), queen (86" x 90"), and king (102" x 90") sizes. Many manufacturers also offer customizable options for specific dimensions if standard sizes don't fit your needs. 

Additional accessories like weighted blankets or specialty shapes (oval, square) can extend the range of available sizes. Always measure your space and specific requirements before selecting a wool blanket size.
