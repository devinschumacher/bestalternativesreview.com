Vivint encrypts all thermostat data both in transit and at rest to protect your information. They don't sell or share your usage data with third parties, maintaining strict privacy controls. 

You can choose to opt out of certain data collection features if you prefer not to share usage patterns with the company. However, this might reduce the advanced learning capabilities of the thermostat.
