## Buyer's Guide

Spending time at the beach requires practical accessories that blend style with functionality. Kate Spade's beach towel line offers a blend of both, with designs that range from classic stripes to playful prints. These towels are known for their durability and absorbency, making them a practical choice for any beach trip. 


### Materials and Construction

The primary material for Kate Spade beach towels is typically cotton, often combined with polyester for added durability. Look for towels with a high cotton content for better absorbency and texture. The construction should include a detailed hemming around the edges to prevent fraying, with reinforced corners for longevity. 


### Size and Dimension

Standard beach towels measure approximately 60 inches by 30 inches, providing ample room to spread out and relax. Consider your specific needs - for family trips, larger towels can be more practical, while smaller sizes may be better for individual use or when space is limited. 


### Print and Design

Kate Spade offers both solid color and patterned towels, with their signature floral and animal designs being particularly popular. Consider the visibility of the print for outdoor use, as dark backgrounds or bold patterns can show sand more easily. The quality of printing is also important; look for designs that appear crisp and well-defined without fading after multiple washes. 


### Care and Maintenance

These towels typically require machine washing but should be air-dried whenever possible to maintain their shape and color. The care label will provide specific instructions, but most Kate Spade beach towels can handle standard washing cycles and bleach if needed. Pay attention to whether the towels include a tag indicating resistance to shrinkage and fading.
