## Buyer's Guide

Moissanite rings combine affordability with characteristics that rival traditional diamond jewelry, making them an attractive option for both engagement and everyday wear. Understanding the key aspects of moissanite quality, sizing, and settings will help you find a ring that meets your style preferences and budget. 


### Understanding Moissanite Quality

When selecting a moissanite ring, consider the quality grade, which ranges from F (excel) to I (industrial). Higher grades typically offer better clarity and fewer imperfections, though G (gem) grade is more than adequate for most settings. Look for settings that showcase the stone's brilliance, such as prong settings that allow light to enter from multiple angles. 


### Choosing the Right Size

Moissanite rings come in various shapes and sizes, requiring careful measurement to ensure a proper fit. Measure your wedding band and compare its width to standard sizing charts. Consider wearing your ring on different fingers as some people find their fingers vary in size. Proper sizing is crucial for comfort and security, as moissanite stones can appear larger than their actual weight. 


### Setting Materials and Durability

The mounting material affects both the ring's appearance and longevity. Platinum and white gold settings enhance the stone's brilliance and durability, while yellow gold settings may affect how the stone appears. Rhodium plating improves platinum and white gold's appearance but requires occasional replating. The setting style should protect the stone's facets, with prongs or bezels securing the stone more effectively than channel settings. 


###  Budget Considerations

Moissanite rings offer significant cost savings compared to diamonds, with comparable stones priced at 10-20% of diamond costs. Set your budget based on the stone's weight rather than diameter, as heavier stones retain their brilliance without excessive size. Factor in mounting costs, which can vary based on material and design complexity. Many jewelers offer financing options for moissanite rings, allowing you to spread the cost over time. 


## FAQ


### What is Moissanite?

Discovered in 1893 by French scientist Henri Moissan, moissanite is a naturally occurring silicon carbide mineral. It wasn't widely recognized as a gemstone until the 1990s when synthetic moissanite was developed for commercial jewelry use. 

The gemstone's brilliance and fire rival that of diamond, making it an affordable alternative for those seeking a sparkling ring without the high cost. 


### How does Moissanite compare to diamond?

While both moissanite and diamond exhibit exceptional brilliance, moissanite has a higher dispersion rate, meaning it showcases more fire (the flashes of rainbow colors) than diamond. However, diamond remains the hardest known natural material, giving it superior durability for daily wear. 

Moissanite scratches more easily than diamond and can lose its brilliance over time if not properly cared for, making diamond the better choice for high-strenth, everyday jewelry. 


### What settings work best with moissanite rings?

For maximal brilliance, it's best to choose prong settings that hold the moissanite from multiple sides. This allows light to enter from all angles and maximize the stone's sparkle. 

Avoid bezel settings or those that cover the girdle of the stone, as these can trap heat and reduce brilliance. Open-back settings are ideal as they allow light to pass through the stone from both sides. 


### How do I clean my moissanite ring?

Regular maintenance involves cleaning your ring weekly with a soft brush and mild soap. This helps remove daily grime that can dull the stone's appearance. 

For deeper cleaning, soak the ring in warm, soapy water for 10-15 minutes, then use the soft brush to remove any remaining residue. Avoid harsh chemicals and ultrasonic cleaners, which can damage the stone's integrity. 


### What's the difference between natural and synthetic moissanite?

Natural moissanite is extremely rare and found only in meteorites. It's incredibly small (typically measuring just 1/1000th of a pearl) and not suitable for jewelry without scientific analysis. 

Synthetic moissanite duplicates the natural variety's chemical and physical properties in a laboratory setting. This man-made version is widely available in jewelry and maintains the characteristic brilliance and fire of its natural counterpart. 


### How long does a moissanite ring last?

With proper care, a well-made moissanite ring can last a lifetime. The stone itself is very durable and resistant to scratches and daily wear. 

However, over time, the metal settings may show signs of wear, especially if the ring isn't maintained regularly. The stone's brilliance can also diminish if it's not cleaned properly, revealing marks and scratches that weren't visible when the ring was new.
