### How does the Ts6320 compare to other Canon printers in its category?

![Canon-Ts6320-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Canon-Ts6320-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What maintenance requirements should I expect?

Basic maintenance includes regular toner and drum replacement, which occur every 1,000 to 2,000 pages depending on usage. The printer should be cleaned monthly using provided cleaning paper and wipes to maintain optimal performance. 

The integrated fuser assembly should be replaced every 12,000 to 15,000 pages, and the input/tray assembly requires periodic cleaning of the paper feed rollers. The device includes LED indicators to help identify when maintenance is needed. 


### What are the primary limitations of the Ts6320?

The main limitations are the lack of wireless connectivity, color printing capability, and advanced features like network printing or mobile printing. It's also less suitable for high-volume printing due to the limited input capacity and slower print speeds compared to professional-grade printers. 

Users who need more than basic printing and faxing capabilities, such as higher print volumes or color output, may want to consider Canon's business-oriented models instead.
