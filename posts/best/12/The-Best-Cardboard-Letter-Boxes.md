### What is a cardboard letter box?

A cardboard letter box is a prefabricated mailbox made from durable cardboard, designed for temporary installations or seasonal use. These boxes are lightweight, easy to assemble, and weather-resistant, making them a practical alternative to traditional metal mailboxes. 

Cardboard letter boxes come in various sizes and styles, including standard residential and commercial designs. They are ideal for short-term mail delivery solutions, such as during home renovations or for temporary business setups. 


### How long do cardboard letter boxes last?

Cardboard letter boxes typically last 6-12 months under regular outdoor conditions, depending on local weather patterns and maintenance. The lifespan can be extended with proper protection from direct sunlight, rain, and extreme temperatures. 

Regular inspection for damage and periodic cleaning can help maintain the box's integrity and appearance. At the end of their useful life, cardboard letter boxes are easily recyclable, making them a sustainable mail delivery solution.

### What sizes are available for cardboard letter boxes?

For higher security needs, consider using a durable mailbox padlock or installing a metal lock plate. Regular maintenance, including door tightening and inspection for damage, helps ensure the box remains secure.

Modern cardboard letter boxes are made from high-density corrugated cardboard reinforced with polyethylene plastic layers. This composite material provides strength and weather resistance while keeping the box lightweight and easy to handle. 

The internal structure typically includes a fire-retardant treatment to prevent quick ignition in case of accidental exposure to flames. The exterior finish often features UV protection to resist fading from sunlight and provide a durable surface.
