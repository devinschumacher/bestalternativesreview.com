## Buyer's Guide

Corner TV wall mounts provide an elegant solution for maximizing viewing space while keeping your entertainment center sleek and unobtrusive. These specialized mounts offer several key benefits, including extended display options, improved cable management, and enhanced wall space efficiency. Understanding the specific needs and capabilities of your TV and mounting environment is crucial for selecting the right corner wall mount. 


### TV Compatibility and Size

When selecting a corner wall mount, compatibility with your television is essential. Consider the TV's weight, which should be well within the rated carrying capacity of the mount. Additionally, measure your TV's exact dimensions to ensure it fits properly within the mounting brackets. Corner mounts often have limited horizontal space, so verify that your TV's height and depth will allow for proper mounting and viewing. 


### Mounting Depth and Wall Space

Corner wall mounts require specific measurements for both the protrusion of the mounting arm and the available wall depth. The mounting arm's reach should extend diagonally to accommodate the TV's full height while staying within the wall's depth capacity. Standard wall thickness varies, so measure from the drywall surface to the back of your stud to determine the maximum safe mounting depth. 


### Adjustability and Viewing Angles

Quality corner wall mounts offer adjustable mechanisms for fine-tuning the TV's position. Pan and tilt features allow you to level the screen and optimize viewing angles, especially in rooms with irregular spacing. Some mounts include rotation capabilities, which can be useful for floor-standing furniture or unique room layouts. The adjustability range should match your room's dimensions and seating arrangements. 


### Safety Features and Installation

Wall mounts for corner applications often incorporate additional safety features beyond standard tv mounting requirements. Look for mounts with reinforced brackets and wider base plates designed specifically for corner mounting. Proper installation requires secure fasteners and wall support, so consider the stud placement and use of expansion bolts. The mounting process should account for the weight distribution and stability, particularly with heavier TVs or larger screens. 


## FAQ


### What is a corner wall mount?

A corner wall mount positions your TV in a wall-mounted bracket that attaches to the inside corner of a wall, maximizing space and providing a sleek look. These mounts typically use specialized hardware that allows the TV to sit parallel to the wall when not in use and swing out for viewing. 

Corner mounts are ideal for rooms where space is limited, such as small apartments, home offices, or entertainment rooms. They're particularly useful when you need to hide wires and reduce visual clutter. 


### Do corner wall mounts work with all TVs?

Most corner wall mounts support a wide range of TV sizes and weights, but compatibility varies by manufacturer. Essential specifications include the maximum TV weight the mount can support, its suitable wall thickness, and the specific VESA pattern compatibility (distance between mounting holes). 

Before purchasing, verify your TV's size, weight, and VESA pattern dimensions match the mount's specifications. Consider checking the TV's mounting instructions for additional compatibility details. 


### How difficult is it to install a corner wall mount?

Corner wall mounts typically require basic tools and some technical know-how. The installation process involves marking wall positions, drilling holes, and attaching the mounting bracket. Most kits include detailed instructions and all necessary hardware. 

Installation time can range from 30 minutes to several hours depending on your experience and wall type. For best results, especially with heavier TVs, consider hiring a professional if you're not comfortable with the installation process. 


### Are corner wall mounts safe for my TV?

Yes, when installed correctly, corner wall mounts provide secure TV mounting. Look for mounting kits that include adjustable mounting brackets to level the TV and distribute weight evenly. The mount should support at least twice the weight of your TV for added safety. 

Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and use wall anchors appropriate for your wall type. Regularly inspect the mounting hardware and adjust as needed to maintain safety and proper TV positioning. 


### Can I use a corner wall mount for my gaming console or tablet?

While corner wall mounts are primarily designed for TVs, they can sometimes accommodate gaming consoles and tablets depending on the specific mount's dimensions and weight capacity. Check the mount's maximum weight limit and ensure the mounting holes align with your device's mounting points. 

For gaming consoles and tablets, consider using additional mounting hardware compatible with the device's mounting pattern. Always verify compatibility and follow proper mounting procedures to avoid damaging your equipment. 


### What should I consider when choosing a corner wall mount?

When selecting a corner wall mount, consider the TV's size, weight, and VESA pattern compatibility. Look for mounting options that offer adjustable height and wall thickness compatibility. Consider the mount's included hardware, such as wall anchors and mounting bolts, to ensure proper installation. 

Think about additional features like cable management, hidden hardware options, and durability ratings. Read reviews and compare warranties to find a mount that matches both your technical needs and aesthetic preferences.
