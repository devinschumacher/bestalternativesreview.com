### [Nails Inc. Sunbeam Crescent Neon Orange Nail Polish](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Orange+Nails?utm\_term=nails-inc-sunbeam-crescent-neon-orange-nail-polish)

![Nails Inc. Sunbeam Crescent Neon Orange Nail Polish | Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcRhJAwkhPt0b3aFf2\_qvdboY9WjrwUsckr0eBOjhfu0pzAGbGBugRxY36jXQRKwdYIfojGle\_OEqlMxwo0E-PZ3g49i1ElXMg&usqp=CAY)

This neon orange nail polish captures summer vibes with its vibrant color, though some find the shade leans more towards a bright yellow than advertised. Swapping out the chunky chunky rectangular cap reveals an inner screw cap, while the thick, slightly chalky formula requires 2-3 coats for full opacity. The long-wearing polish dries quickly and applies smoothly, though uneven application might be noticeable with thinner coats.

## Buyer's Guide

Orange nails have become increasingly popular in recent years, offering a vibrant alternative to traditional red or pink shades. This guide explores the key factors to consider when selecting orange nail polish, helping you choose a shade that matches your style and complements your skin tone. 


### Shade Selection

Orange nail polish ranges from warm, golden tones to cool, copper undertones. Consider your personal style and the occasion for your nail choice. Warm oranges work well with earthy tones and natural nail shapes, while cool oranges complement cooler skin tones and modern nail art designs. 

![Orange-Nails-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Orange-Nails-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Formulation

When selecting an orange nail polish, pay attention to the formulation for long-lasting wear. Look for products with added ingredients like moisturizers for smoother application and faster-drying times. Premium nail polishes often offer better color retention and chip resistance compared to drugstore options. 


### Application Tips

Proper application technique is crucial for achieving a professional-looking result. Start by applying a base coat to seal your natural nail surface. Use a thin layer of orange polish for even coverage, allowing each layer to dry before applying the next. Finish with a clear top coat for added protection and shine. 

![Orange-Nails-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Orange-Nails-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Cleanup and Care

Removing orange nail polish can be challenging due to its warm undertones. Opt for acetone-based nail polish removers to prevent damage to your natural nails during cleanup. Keep your polish protected by storing it in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight, which can cause color fading over time. 


## FAQ

![Orange-Nails-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Orange-Nails-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Why do people choose orange nails?

Orange nails can bring warmth and vibrancy to any look, making them ideal for both casual and formal occasions. They're versatile enough to pair with almost any outfit while adding a touch of personality. 

Orange nail polish is suitable for all skin types and tones, though it may not be the best choice for those with extremely sensitive or reactive skin. It's important to choose a high-quality base and top coat to maintain the color's intensity and durability. 


### How long does orange nail polish usually last?

With proper care, orange nail polish can last 2-3 weeks, similar to other solid-colored polishes. This duration can vary based on factors like hand washing frequency, nail biting habits, and quality of the polish. 

To extend the wear time, apply a base coat before the polish and a top coat afterward. This protective layer helps prevent chipping and keeps the color vivid longer. Regular touch-ups with a top coat can also maintain the polish's appearance. 

![Orange-Nails-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Orange-Nails-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are some popular orange nail trends?

The shade spectrum for orange nails ranges from warm tangerine to deep rust tones. Current trends include geometric designs, gradient effects, and incorporating metallic accents to add depth and interest. 

Color blocking with complementary shades like blue or green can create striking contrasts. Layering with natural nails or artificial extensions can also enhance the look and provide more versatility in styling options. 


### How do you remove orange nail polish properly?

Use an orange-peel remover or a nail polish remover containing acetone to effectively remove orange nail polish. These products break down the polish and lift it off the nails without damaging the cuticles or nail bed. 

Soak cotton pads in the remover and apply them to the nails for about 30 seconds. Gently push back the cuticles and remove the pads. For stubborn chips, use a cuticle pusher to remove any residue. Finish with a nourishing cuticle cream and hand lotion. 

![Orange-Nails-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Orange-Nails-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Are there specific tools needed for orange nail care?

A basic nail care kit should include nail clippers, nail files, cuticle pushers, and nail buffers. These tools help maintain healthy nails and make it easier to apply and remove nail polish. 

Consider investing in a nail brush and nail clippers designed for your nail shape (square, oval, etc. ). Regular maintenance with these tools prevents hangnails and makes nail polish application more effective. 


### What should you avoid when wearing orange nails?

Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive objects to remove the polish, as they can damage the nail surface and surrounding skin. This includes excessive use of nail polish removers or attempting to remove polish with pumice stones or other rough surfaces. 

Be cautious about wearing orange nails if you're allergic to certain ingredients in nail products. If you experience irritation, redness, or other symptoms, discontinue use and consult a dermatologist.
