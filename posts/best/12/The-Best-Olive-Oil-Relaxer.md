## Buyer's Guide

Olive oil relaxers are used before hair dyeing to help loosen and soften the outer layer of the hair shaft, making it easier for the dye to penetrate. They're particularly useful for achieving vibrant, long-lasting color results, though they require careful use to avoid damage. 


### Key Ingredients

Olive oil relaxers contain a combination of concentrated olive oil, sodium hydroxide (lye), and sometimes additional chemicals that break down the hair's protective cuticle. The ratio of these components affects the product's strength and the extent of hair relaxation.

### Strength Levels

These products come in various strengths, typically ranging from 10% to 20% strength. The higher the percentage, the greater the level of relaxation and potential hair damage. Choose based on your hair type and the desired intensity of color change. 


### Processing Time

Standard processing times range from 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the product strength and hair texture. Longer processing times can lead to more severe relaxation, so it's important to follow the instructions carefully.

### After Treatment Care

A thorough neutralizing process is crucial after using an olive oil relaxer to neutralize any remaining lye and prevent damage. This typically involves applying a neutralizing cream for 15-45 minutes, followed by a professional shampoo and deep conditioning treatment. 


## FAQ

![Olive-Oil-Relaxer-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Olive-Oil-Relaxer-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is an Olive Oil Relaxer?

An Olive Oil Relaxer is a hair product specifically designed to relax tight curls, waves, and natural textured hair. It contains ingredients like lye or lime juice that break down the protein structure of the hair, making curls more manageable and straightened. 

The process begins by applying olive oil to the scalp and hair, followed by the relaxer solution. The hair is then wrapped in plastic and covered with a heat-capable towel. The combination of the relaxing agent and heat helps break down the hair's natural curl pattern. 


### How Long Does the Process Take?

Preparing the hair and applying the relaxer typically takes 1-2 hours. The active relaxing process can take anywhere from 45 minutes to several hours, depending on the product and individual hair type. 

The total process from start to finish usually takes 3-6 hours, including preparation time, application, waiting period, and cooling down time for the scalp and hair. 

![Olive-Oil-Relaxer-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Olive-Oil-Relaxer-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What Hair Types Can Use an Olive Oil Relaxer?

Olive Oil Relaxers are designed for all natural hair types, from tightly coiled to loosely curly hair. However, they are particularly effective on hair with tightly defined curls and natural waves. 

The relaxer should not be used on hair that is severely damaged, over-processed, or contains extensions and weaves, as these factors can affect the outcome and increase the risk of damage. 


### How Often Can I Use an Olive Oil Relaxer?

It's recommended to wait at least 6-8 weeks between relaxer applications to give the hair time to recover and regrow strong. Over-processing can lead to hair breakage, loss, and severe damage. 

The frequency of relaxing depends on your styling habits and hair maintenance routine. Some individuals may prefer to relax their hair every 6-12 weeks, while others opt for natural waves or curls between treatments. 

![Olive-Oil-Relaxer-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Olive-Oil-Relaxer-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can I Use Natural Ingredients with an Olive Oil Relaxer?

While natural ingredients can complement the relaxer process, it's crucial to avoid adding oils, butters, or natural products that may interfere with the chemical reaction. Follow the product instructions carefully to maintain the effectiveness of the relaxer. 

After the relaxer process, natural ingredients can be used to moisturize and style the hair. Popular options include plain aloe vera gel, natural leave-in conditioners, and argan oil. 


### What Should I Do if the Relaxer Burns or Causes Pain?

If you experience burning, intense itching, or severe pain during the relaxer process, immediately wash off the product with plenty of cool water and a mild shampoo. This may indicate an adverse reaction or improper application. 

Always perform a patch test before applying the relaxer to a larger area of your scalp. If you have sensitive skin or experience discomfort, consult a dermatologist before proceeding with the full process.
