## Buyer's Guide

Skechers high tops combine style and comfort in their signature footwear. Understanding key features helps you choose the right pair for your needs. 


### Construction and Materials

Skechers use durable materials like synthetic leather and mesh for their high top sneakers. The construction quality varies across models - look for reinforced stitching and sturdy tongues. Some models incorporate synthetic mesh for breathability, while others feature full suede or leather upper. 


### Arch Support and Fit

Unlike traditional high tops, Skechers emphasize arch support through their patented technologies like Foot Pillow or Sports Pillow technology. These supportive elements help prevent foot fatigue during long wears. The fit should be snug but not tight - allow about a thumb's width between your longest toe and the end of the shoe. 


### Sole Technology

The outsole composition affects both comfort and traction. Heavier models use rubber for lasting grip, while more athletic versions might incorporate blown rubber for better energy return. The heel counter design impacts stability - a more pronounced counter provides better security during high-impact activities. 


### Color and Style Options

Skechers offers extensive color options, from solid tones to bold patterns. Consider how the colors complement your wardrobe and personal style. The style elements like eyelets, laces, and side panels vary by model - some prefer minimalist designs while others want elaborate detailing. 


## FAQ


### What sets Skechers high tops apart from other styles?

Skechers high tops combine a taller silhouette with their signature blend of comfort and performance features. These shoes typically offer better ankle support and a slightly more structured feel compared to their mid-top counterparts, making them ideal for longer wearing sessions or specific activities where ankle stability is crucial. 

Most high-top models maintain Skechers' trademark cushioning systems like Gel technology and Pronite mesh, delivering the same level of shock absorption and breathability expected from their lower-cut shoes. The primary difference lies in the additional strap and enclosure around the ankle, which can be particularly beneficial for running, walking, or casual wear in colder weather. 


### How do Skechers high tops compare in terms of cushioning?

Skechers high tops generally maintain the same impressive cushioning standards as their mid-top models. Many feature dual-density foam midsoles with moisture-wicking mesh and plush heel cups, providing similar levels of shock absorption and comfort during extended wear. 

The primary difference is that high-top designs may incorporate additional layers of cushioning directly under the ankle, creating a more supportive platform for standing, walking, or running. This extra cushioning can make them feel slightly more padded than lower-cut models while maintaining the brand's renowned comfort profile. 


### What activities are Skechers high tops suitable for?

Skechers high tops excel in everyday wear, walking, and running. Their taller silhouette and reinforced ankle support make them particularly suitable for activities where stability is crucial, such as long walks, casual runs, or walking in colder weather. 

While most models maintain the brand's signature comfort features, some high-top styles may be better suited to specific activities. For instance, basketball-inspired models might feature extra toe protection and a slightly different fit compared to traditional walking or running variants. 


### How do Skechers high tops compare in terms of breathability?

Skechers consistently prioritizes ventilation in their high-top designs, using the same moisture-wicking mesh found in their mid-top models. Most high-top shoes feature strategic ventilation panels and mesh uppers to keep feet cool and dry during extended wear. 

Some high-top styles may incorporate additional ventilation features specific to their design, such as breathable mesh panels on the sides or strategic cutouts around the laces. These design elements ensure that even with the added height, feet remain comfortable and dry. 


### What size considerations should I keep in mind when choosing Skechers high tops?

Like all footwear, proper sizing is crucial for Skechers high tops. These shoes tend to run true to size, with most models offering a snug but comfortable fit that's slightly roomier than athletic footwear. 

Key considerations include ankle width preference, intended use (casual, athletic, or formal), and whether you prefer a narrow or wide fit. It's generally recommended to try on multiple styles within your size range to find the perfect balance of support and comfort for your foot shape and activity level. 


### What maintenance requirements do Skechers high tops have?

Skechers high tops typically maintain the same care requirements as their mid-top counterparts. Regular cleaning with a damp cloth and mild soap keeps the leather or synthetic materials clean and extends the life of the shoes. 

For longer-lasting performance, consider using a quality shoe cleaner and conditioner specifically designed for athletic footwear. Most high-top styles respond well to these basic maintenance practices, keeping them looking new for longer periods.
