This sample set lets you sniff your way through Le Labo's most iconic city scents without committing to full-size bottles. The petite 1. 5 ml samples are expertly curated to showcase the New York-based perfumery's signature notes – from zesty cedrat to warm vanilla – all bottled in that signature kraft box that makes it look like you've discovered something special. 


### [Le Labo Cedrat 37 Sample, 1.5 ml](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Le+Labo+Perfume?utm\_term=le-labo-cedrat-37-sample-1-5-ml)

From August to September, Le Labo's CEDRAT 37 invites you to experience a Berlin-like blend of fresh cedrat and ginger that's both acidy and surprisingly sweet. Its signature Le Labo complexity emerges through a woodsier foundation that includes musks and ambergris, creating a distinctive character that's both inviting and complex. The sample, while tiny at just 1.5 ml, delivers a surprisingly concentrated taste of this unique fragrance. 


### [Le Labo Vanille 44 Sample](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Le+Labo+Perfume?utm\_term=le-labo-vanille-44-sample)

If you're visiting Paris between August and September, you might spot a rather secretive Le Labo boutique hiding vanilla-themed bottles that defy expectations. These 1.5 ml samples contain a complex concoction where vanilla isn't quite vanilla – it's transformed into something altogether more intriguing. The Parisian labs only produce this scent during its limited run, making it a must-try for those in the know. 


### [Le Labo Citron 28](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Le+Labo+Perfume?utm\_term=le-labo-citron-28)

## Buyer's Guide

Le Labo's perfumes blend innovative formulations with distinctive bottle designs, making each fragrance a curated piece of art. Understanding the nuances of their scents requires considering several key factors: base notes, bottle design, scent profile complexity, and longevity. 


### Base Notes: The Heart of Each Fragrance

The base notes form the foundation of a Le Labo scent, providing lasting depth and character. These typically include materials like patchouli, vetiver, and amber. Identifying your preferred base notes can help narrow down potential choices. 


### Bottle Design: More than Just a Container

Each Le Labo bottle is a work of design, with shapes and finishes intended to complement the fragrance within. Consider how the bottle's aesthetics align with your personal style while also protecting the perfume from light and air exposure. 


### Scent Profile Complexity: Layered Fragrances

Le Labo blends create complex olfactory experiences through multiple layers. Some fragrances feature bold contrasts, while others present subtle, harmonious compositions. Understanding your preference for scent complexity can guide your selection. 


### Longevity: The Final Impression

A Le Labo perfume's longevity depends on several factors including base notes, bottle design, and application technique. Generally, these fragrances offer exceptional wear, with lasting power that sets them apart in the market. 


## FAQ


### What makes Le Labo perfumes different from other luxury fragrances?

Le Labo's distinctive approach centers on a single, powerful scent accord, with fewer, more concentrated ingredients than traditional fragrances. Each scent features a signature "hero" note that forms the core of the composition, with supporting notes that enhance rather than compete with it. 

This minimalistic formula allows the fragrance to evolve over time and on different skin types, creating a unique olfactory experience for each wearer. The brand also distinguishes itself through its premium packaging, minimalist design ethos, and commitment to natural and sustainable ingredients where possible. 


### Are Le Labo perfumes suitable for all skin types?

Le Labo fragrances contain natural ingredients like essential oils and absolutes, which might cause irritation for individuals with sensitive skin. The brand recommends patch testing before full application to check for any allergic reactions. 

Most Le Labo formulas contain no synthetic materials, though some scents may contain natural ingredients that could be problematic for certain skin types. The brand advises consulting a dermatologist if you have severe skin sensitivities or conditions. 


### How long does a Le Labo perfume typically last?

Each Le Labo fragrance has distinct longevity due to its concentrated formula. Generally, the eaux de parfum last between 8-12 hours, while the eaux de toilette offer 4-6 hours of wear. 

Application technique and daily activities can affect longevity. Applying in darker areas like wrists and behind ears, and using sprays rather than dabs, can extend wear time. Indoor vs. outdoor use also impacts retention, with indoor environments allowing the fragrance to develop more fully. 


### What sizes are available for Le Labo products?

Le Labo offers a range of sizes for both eau de toilette and eau de parfum. Travel sizes (0.33oz) and sample sizes (0.2oz) are available for testing new scents, while regular sizes range from 1.7oz to 2.5oz bottles. 

For long-term use, the brand's iconic 6oz bottle is available for most scents, offering the most cost-effective option per ml. The larger 8oz bottle is also available for popular scents like Santal 33 and Bergamote 22. 


### Are Le Labo fragrances vegan-friendly?

Le Labo fragrances contain no animal products or testing materials, making them suitable for vegans. The brand does not use musk, civet, or other animal-derived ingredients that are common in perfumery. 

While their commitment to vegan principles is clear, potential trace amounts of natural materials might be present due to botanical sourcing. Always check the specific ingredients list for any concerns about purity or labeling. 


### What is the return policy for Le Labo products?

Le Labo offers a 21-day return policy for unopened products purchased directly from their official website or authorized retailers. Any returns must be unused and in their original packaging. 

For returns or exchanges, contact Le Labo's customer service team, providing your order number and explanation for the return. The brand may request photos of the packaging and unused product for verification before processing your request.
