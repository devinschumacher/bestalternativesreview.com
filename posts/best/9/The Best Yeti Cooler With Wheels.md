## Buyer's Guide

When selecting a Yeti cooler with wheels, several factors will influence your choice, including capacity, insulation quality, material durability, and wheel system. Understanding these aspects will help you find a cooler that matches your specific needs for outdoor adventures, tailgating, or beach trips. 


### Cooler Capacity and Dimensions

### Insulation Performance

Yeti coolers are renowned for their exceptional insulation, utilizing thick walls and advanced thermal seals. Look for models with a minimum of 2 inches of foam insulation.
