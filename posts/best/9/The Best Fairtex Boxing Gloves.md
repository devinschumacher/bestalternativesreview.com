## Buyer's Guide

Fairtex boxing gloves combine comfort with protection, featuring padded palms and knuckles to safeguard your hands during training and competition. These gloves serve multiple purposes - enhancing grip during striking practice, protecting your hands from impacts, and preventing common boxing injuries. 


### Glove Size and Fit

Selecting the right glove size is crucial for both performance and hand protection. Fairtex gloves typically come in sizes ranging from Small to XL. To determine your size, measure around your fist (excluding your thumb) and compare it to the circumference chart provided by the manufacturer. Proper fit allows for full mobility while keeping your hands secure within the glove.

### Padding and Protection

The padding distribution affects how well the glove protects your hands. Fairtex gloves usually offer thickest padding in the palm and knuckles. High-quality padding materials minimize hand fatigue during long sessions and reduce the impact force transmitted to your joints. Consider gloves with anatomical padding that conforms to the natural shape of your hand for better protection and reduced stress on your wrists. 


### Care and Maintenance

Proper maintenance ensures your Fairtex gloves last longer and remain effective. Most gloves require washing after each use to remove sweat and debris. Use a mild soap and cool water, avoiding harsh chemicals that can damage the materials. After washing, air dry the gloves completely before storing them. Protect glove stitching from fraying by keeping them in a breathable bag when not in use.

### Grip and Technique Development

The material and texture of the gloves impact your grip during training. Fairtex gloves often include specialized patterns on the palm to improve grip while striking. Quality gloves maintain their grip properties even when wet, which is particularly important for indoor boxing facilities. Additionally, the glove weight affects punch speed and power development - lighter gloves enhance speed, while heavier ones build stamina and technique.

![Fairtex Boxing Gloves-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Fairtex+Boxing+Gloves-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Are the gloves properly padded?

Yes, Fairtex gloves are well-padded throughout the palm and fingers, with reinforced protection in the heel of the hand and knuckle areas. The padding offers excellent impact absorption during punches and grasps. 

While some advanced boxers might prefer less padding for faster movement, the gloves strike a good balance for most users. The padding is dense enough to protect hands during heavy bag work and sparring. 


### Are these gloves suitable for all training types?

Yes, the gloves are suitable for all types of boxing training, including bag work, sparring, and shadowboxing. They provide adequate protection for regular training sessions and competition preparation. 

However, for very light exercises or specific techniques requiring minimal hand protection, boxers should consider thinner gloves. The Fairtex models offer versatile protection suitable for most training scenarios.
