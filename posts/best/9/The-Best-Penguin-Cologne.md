## Buyer's Guide

Penguin Cologne has become a popular choice among men who appreciate its distinctive scent profile. This guide examines the key features of the Penguin Cologne family, helping you understand what makes each fragrance unique. 


### Eau de Toilette vs Eau de Cologne

The Penguin line offers both Eau de Toilette (EDT) and Eau de Cologne (EDC) formulations. While both contain the same fragrance core, EDT typically lasts longer and is more concentrated. EDC is lighter and more refreshing, making it ideal for warmer weather or casual occasions.

### Parfum Strength Levels

Penguin's fragrances range from Light to Strong parfum strengths. Light fragrances maintain their character for 1-2 hours, while Strong formulas can last 8-10 hours. Consider your daily activities and desired wear time when selecting a strength level. 


### Top-Note Selection

The top note defines a fragrance's immediate character. Penguin offers three top notes: Woody (fir balsam, cedarwood), Citrus (bergamot, lemon), and Aquatic (seaweed, ocean spritz). Your choice should align with your personal preference and occasion-appropriate freshness.
