### How does a Blackstone griddle stand improve cooking performance?

The stand elevates the griddle, which optimizes heat distribution by allowing proper airflow underneath the cooking surface.

The raised position also minimizes heat loss to the ground, keeping more heat directed toward the food.

### Can a Blackstone griddle stand be used with any griddle?

Not all Blackstone griddle stands are compatible with every griddle model. The stand's size and design must match your specific griddle's dimensions and weight. Always check the manufacturer's specifications for compatibility before purchasing. 

Some stands are universal and will work with multiple griddle models, while others are specifically designed for particular series or models. Ensure the stand you choose matches your griddle to prevent compatibility issues that could affect performance or safety. 


### How should I maintain and care for a Blackstone griddle stand?

Regular maintenance includes checking the legs for stability and adjusting as needed. Keep the grease management system clean and free from debris to maintain effective performance. For cleaning, use mild soap and water, avoiding harsh chemicals that might damage the stand's surface. 

Store the stand in a dry place when not in use, and inspect regularly for any signs of wear or damage, particularly the adjustable legs and support structures. Following these care instructions will help ensure your stand remains functional and safe for years of use.
