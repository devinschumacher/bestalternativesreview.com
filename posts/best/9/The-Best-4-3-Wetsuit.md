### [O'Neill Epic 4/3 Full Wetsuit Men's Black](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/4+3+Wetsuit?utm\_term=oneill-epic-4-3-full-wetsuit-mens-black)

![O'Neill Epic 4/3 Full Wetsuit Men's Black | Image](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcRyRy-So4KN3xZral4BO4VdY1DH7IUDNwzjATEIog7kw6zKNh3vaZQ5jDXFfR39h1VFUB4qmiWtLhiOgdubmbtB8C7l\_x-\_KQ&usqp=CAY)

This versatile 4/3 wetsuit combines flexible FluidFlex insulation with durable Krypto knee pads for reliable protection during your session.

## Buyer's Guide

Choosing the right 4/3 wetsuit is crucial for maintaining body heat and comfort during colder water activities. Here are key considerations to help you select the perfect wetsuit for your needs. 


### Neoprene Type and Quality

The neoprene wall thickness usually ranges between 3mm to 5mm. Thinner neoprene allows for flexibility and quick movement, while thicker material provides better insulation in very cold waters. The quality of the neoprene affects its durability and warmth retention. High-quality neoprene tends to retain its shape and insulating properties longer than lower-grade materials. 


### Seam Construction

Seams can be glued, blindstitched, or blindstitched with tape. Glued and taped seams provide the best waterproof barrier but can be less flexible. Blindstitched seams balance flexibility and water resistance well. Consider the seam type based on your intended use - more aggressive water sports may benefit from glued seams, while casual use allows for more flexibility in seam construction. 


### Zipper Options

The zipper is a critical component affecting both waterproofing and ease of use. Full-length zippers offer better waterproofing but can be cumbersome in cold water. YKK zippers are a reliable choice for their durability and smooth operation. Some suits feature internal zippers to prevent chafing, which can be beneficial for extended dives or cold water excursions. 


### Additional Features

Consider extra features like adjustable cuffs, booties compatibility, and shoulder pads. Adjustable cuffs prevent water entry at the wrists and improve fit. Booties compatibility ensures your boots stay warm without causing bulk. Shoulder pads protect against punctures from gear and provide additional insulation in cold conditions. 


## FAQ


### What is a 4/3 wetsuit?

A 4/3 wetsuit is a type of full-body diving suit that provides excellent insulation in cold water environments. The 4/3 designation refers to the thickness of the neoprene material: 4mm in key areas like the torso and 3mm in the arms and legs. 

These suits are ideal for temperate water temperatures between 60-70°F (15-21°C). They offer superior warmth compared to thinner suits while maintaining good flexibility and mobility. 


### What are the main benefits of a 4/3 wetsuit?

The primary advantage of a 4/3 wetsuit is its balance between thermal insulation and flexibility. The thicker neoprene provides better cold protection than 5/4 or 3/2 suits, while the leg and arm panels maintain essential range of motion for diving. 

These suits also excel in durability, featuring reinforced knees and elbows that resist wear from diving equipment. The longer torso coverage offers better protection against cold water shock and hypothermia. 


### Who should consider a 4/3 wetsuit?

Recreational divers in temperate climates should prioritize 4/3 wetsuits for their versatility. The suit provides adequate insulation for most dives while allowing sufficient flexibility for normal movements. 

Technical divers and those who need extended cold-water protection may also benefit from 4/3 suits. However, divers in very cold or tropical waters may need different thicknesses to stay comfortable. 


### How do 4/3 wetsuits compare to 5/4 or 3/2 suits?

Compared to 5/4 suits, 4/3 wetsuits offer slightly better flexibility due to their thinner neoprene in arm and leg panels. However, they provide superior warmth in most temperate water conditions. 

3/2 suits sacrifice warmth for increased flexibility and are better suited for warmer waters. 4/3s strike a balance between these extremes, making them versatile choices for many divers. 


### What maintenance requirements do 4/3 wetsuits have?

Proper care extends the life of your 4/3 wetsuit. Rinse it thoroughly after each use with fresh water and hang it to dry in a cool, ventilated area. Avoid direct sunlight and heating sources that can damage the neoprene. 

Store the suit in a dry place, preferably in a wetsuit bag. Consider using neoprene cleaner and conditioning cream to maintain its shape and prevent odor buildup. 


### Are there specific features to look for in a 4/3 wetsuit?

Key features include taped seams for water resistance, reinforced knees and elbows, and adjustable cuffs and ankles for a customized fit. Consider a suit with integrated boots or booties for additional protection. 

Look for a well-balanced thickness distribution: 4mm torso, 3mm arms and legs, with 2mm panels at the joints. The suit should allow 1-2mm of stretch while maintaining its shape.
