### Ring Size and Fit

Proper fit is essential for both comfort and durability. Most Le Vian rings come in standard sizes, but custom sizing is possible. Consider your preferred ring width and style (stackable, solitaire, etc. ) as larger sizes may affect overall design proportions. The band should sit flush against the finger without wobble. 


### Design Elements

The Combination Collection typically includes three stones in a shared prong setting, while other styles vary. Consider whether you prefer traditional diamond settings or alternative stones like moissanite. The ring's overall design should complement your body type and personal style.

### What makes Le Vian rings unique?

Le Vian's signature color gemstone, the patented Ceylon Blue Topaz, is the most distinctive feature of their rings. This proprietary gemstone, mined exclusively in Sri Lanka, comes in rich blue tones with a hint of green, creating a signature color that's instantly recognizable. The company also specializes in heart-shaped cabochons, often set in elegant designs that combine precious metals with this signature gemstone. 

Each Le Vian ring is crafted from the company's patented "Blue Topaz Forever Ring" technology, which binds the Ceylon Blue Topaz to the gold setting through a patented manufacturing process that creates a stronger bond than traditional settings. This results in a more durable and secure piece of jewelry. 


### What metals do Le Vian rings use?

Le Vian primarily works with yellow gold, white gold, and rose gold. Their rings typically feature either an 14k or 18k gold setting, with the choice between these two depending on personal preference and the specific design. They offer a wide range of styles in each metal option, from classic bands to intricate floral designs. 

For those who prefer platinum, Le Vian also offers a selection of rings in 14k and 18k white gold that mimic the look and feel of platinum while providing more affordability. The company is known for creating platinum-like pieces that maintain their shape and brilliance over time.

Le Vian's heart-shaped cabochons are a hallmark of their designs, appearing in nearly every collection. These cabochons represent the company's commitment to romance and emotional connection, with each piece telling a story of love and dedication. The hearts range from simple, elegant shapes to detailed, ornate designs that add visual interest to the jewelry. 

The company's hearts are available in both smooth and faceted styles, with some featuring additional detailing like pave-set diamonds or enamel work. These elements not only enhance the visual appeal of the piece but also add symbolic meaning, representing facets of relationships like trust, commitment, and passion. 


### What sizes are Le Vian rings available in?

Le Vian offers a standard ring sizing range that covers most common sizes, typically from 4.5 to 9.5 for women and 7 to 13 for men. They provide specific size charts for both women's and men's collections, allowing customers to find their perfect fit. The company's rings are available in half sizes, giving a wider range of options within each whole size category. 

For customers who need assistance finding their exact size, Le Vian recommends using their sizing guidelines rather than relying on traditional ring sizing charts. This approach helps account for the specific characteristics of Le Vian's patented setting technology and the unique geometry of their rings.

### What are the durability characteristics of Le Vian rings?

Le Vian's rings are known for their durability, thanks to the company's patented "Blue Topaz Forever Ring" technology. This proprietary manufacturing process creates a stronger bond between the Ceylon Blue Topaz and the gold setting than traditional settings, resulting in jewelry that holds up well to everyday wear. The company guarantees that the Ceylon Blue Topaz will remain secure in the setting for life, with minor exceptions for everyday wear and care. 

While the rings are generally very durable, the company recommends removing them during vigorous activities like sports or house cleaning to prevent damage. Proper care, including regular cleaning and inspection, will help maintain the brilliance and integrity of these jewelry pieces. 


### How much do Le Vian rings cost?

Le Vian's rings fall into the mid-to-high price range for jewelry, with most pieces costing between $400 and $2,500. The exact price depends on several factors, including the specific design, metal quality, and size. Heart-shaped cabochons tend to be slightly more expensive than similar-sized oval cut stones, while diamond accents increase the cost significantly. 

When considering a purchase, it's worth comparing the value of Le Vian rings to similar pieces from other designers. The company's patented technology and proprietary gemstone do come at a premium, but many customers find the combination of design quality and durability justifies the cost.
