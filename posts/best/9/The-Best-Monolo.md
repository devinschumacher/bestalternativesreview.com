## Buyer's Guide

Monolo products combine style with practicality, offering a distinctive footwear choice. Understanding their key features will help you select the right pair for your needs. 


### Construction and Materials

High-quality monolo shoes incorporate durable materials like full-grain leather for the upper and rubber for the sole. Consider the quality of craftsmanship, as well as moisture-wicking fabrics for performance footwear. 

![Monolo-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Monolo-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Heel Design

The heel's height and shape significantly impact comfort and style. Choose between kitten heels (1-2 inches) for the most casual look, platform heels (2-3 inches) for added height, or stacked heels (over 3 inches) for a formal appearance. 


### Closure Options

Monolo shoes typically feature a single strap that wraps around the forefoot and heel. The strap's width and material determine how secure the fit is. For narrower feet, look for straps made from flexible materials like python print leather. 

![Monolo-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Monolo-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Size and Fit

These shoes generally run half a size smaller than conventional footwear. The fit should be snug but not tight, with enough room for a thin layer of tissue paper between your heel and the inner heel counter. The ball of your foot should sit directly under the strap.
