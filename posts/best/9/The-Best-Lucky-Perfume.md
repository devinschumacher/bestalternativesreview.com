### Choosing the Right Sillage and Intensity

Liquid Luck perfumes come in different intensities: classic, eau de toilette, and eau de parfum. The intensity determines how long the fragrance lasts and how far it travels from you - this is known as sillage. Consider whether you want a subtle, personal scent or one that makes a lasting impression. 


### Size Considerations

The size of your bottle depends on your needs and how you prefer to use fragrance. Small travel sizes are ideal for testing new scents or when you're on the go. Medium-sized bottles offer the most value for daily use, while larger bottles are practical if you apply perfume regularly.

### Additional Features and Packaging

The bottle's design can affect how the fragrance behaves - clear bottles may lose scent more quickly, while black bottles protect the fragrance better. Choose packaging that matches your style preferences. Gift sets often include bonus items like spritzers or complementary fragrances if you're buying multiple bottles.

### Are Lucky perfumes suitable for all skin types?

### How long does Lucky Perfume last?

The longevity of Lucky Perfume varies by fragrance and usage. Under ideal conditions, fragrances typically last 3-6 hours when applied to clean skin. The longevity can be extended by applying to pulse points or wearing after showering. 

Environmental factors such as temperature and humidity can affect how long a fragrance lasts. In warmer conditions, fragrances tend to evaporate more quickly, while cooler temperatures can help maintain scent longevity. 


### How should Lucky Perfume be stored?

To maximize fragrance longevity and preserve scent integrity, store Lucky Perfume in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat sources. Exposure to these elements can degrade the quality of the fragrance over time. 

Keep the bottle tightly sealed when not in use and avoid storing it near chemical products or strong-smelling items as these can interfere with the fragrance's characteristics.
