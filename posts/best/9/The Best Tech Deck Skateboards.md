## Buyer's Guide

Tech Deck skateboards combine performance features with modern designs, making them a popular choice among skateboard enthusiasts. When selecting a tech deck skateboard, several key factors will influence your decision, including board size, deck material, truck specifications, and quality of truck and axle bushings. These elements work together to determine the board's responsiveness, durability, and overall performance. 


### Board Size

Skateboard dimensions typically range from 7.5 inches to 9.0 inches in width and 29 inches to 32 inches in length. Wider decks (8.0 inches and above) provide better stability for tricks and ollies but may feel less responsive for aggressive riding. Narrower decks (7.5 to 7.9 inches) offer more board control and easier tricks, though they can be less forgiving for beginners. The length of the board affects your stance width; longer boards (31 inches and above) give you more room to maneuver but require more energy to carry. 

![Tech-Deck-Skateboards-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Tech-Deck-Skateboards-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Deck Material

Most tech decks use 7-ply maple construction, which provides a good balance of stiffness and flexibility. The thickness of the deck influences how it responds to your riding technique: thinner decks (0.75 to 0.875 inches) pop more for tricks but feel more radical, while thicker decks (0.9 inches and above) absorb impact better but lose some pop. Some manufacturers offer custom shaping options like cutouts or carbon fiber inserts for added performance features without compromising durability. 


### Truck Specifications

The trucks attach the deck to the wheels and significantly impact turning precision and stability. Common spread distances range from 120mm (7.5 degree tilt) to 135mm (10 degree tilt), with wider spreads allowing for more radical turns but potentially reducing straight-line stability. The baseplate material (typically steel or aluminum) affects durability and weight, with aluminum offering lighter boards at the cost of increased flex. Premium trucks feature custom hardware like stainless steel kingpins and bushings engineered for specific riding styles. 

![Tech-Deck-Skateboards-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Tech-Deck-Skateboards-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Quality of Truck and Axle Bushings

While not immediately visible, the quality of bushings (the rubber components between the baseplate and truck hangers) directly influences riding smoothness and durability. Professional-grade bushings use high-resilience materials that maintain their shape under load while absorbing vibrations. Higher-quality bushings also feature more precise tolerances, ensuring consistent truck hanger alignment and reducing wobble during turns. Look for bushings that offer both firm response for technical riding and adequate flex for smooth transitions. 


## FAQ

![Tech-Deck-Skateboards-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Tech-Deck-Skateboards-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What makes Tech Deck skateboards unique?

These skateboards stand out with their precision-engineered performance and durability. Unlike other brands, Tech Deck uses high-quality materials and intricate designs that create an exceptional riding experience. 

Each skateboard undergoes rigorous quality control, ensuring every deck meets their exacting standards for consistency and longevity. 


### What size decks do Tech Deck offer?

They typically manufacture decks in standard sizes, ranging from 7.5" to 8.5". Most popular variants fall within this range, offering plenty of options for different riding styles and preferences. 

Each deck size carefully balances performance capabilities and handling characteristics to serve various skill levels and riding goals. 

![Tech-Deck-Skateboards-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Tech-Deck-Skateboards-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Are Tech Deck skateboards suitable for beginners?

While they offer decks with slightly smaller wheels (52-57mm) which are more common in beginner setups, these boards actually provide moderate cushioning and stability that experienced riders appreciate. 

The reduced board size, at 7.5" to 8.0", makes them easier to control initially but limits length-related tricks compared to larger decks. 


### What technologies does Tech Deck patent for their skateboards?

Their proprietary technology includes a reinforced core system and specialized shaping techniques that enhance deck rigidity while maintaining flexibility for pop and responsiveness. 

These innovations help deliver greater control andpop compared to non-patented designs, though exact specifications vary between models. 

![Tech-Deck-Skateboards-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Tech-Deck-Skateboards-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do Tech Deck's wheel options compare to competitors?

They consistently use higher-quality wheels with better durometer ratings and more precise trues. While not offering the extremely fast-rolling options found in some premium brands, their wheels excel in precise, controlled carving and sliding. 

Wheel sizes range between 52-57mm, with slight variations between models, matching popular industry standards without excessive bulk. 


### What is the typical lifespan of a Tech Deck skateboard?

With regular maintenance, most Tech Deck boards can maintain their performance characteristics for 3-5 years, depending on usage frequency and conditions. This lifespan exceeds many similarly priced options due to superior material selection. 

Like any skateboard, proper storage in a dry environment and regular inspection for wear will significantly extend the life of the deck and components.
