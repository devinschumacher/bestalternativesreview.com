## Buyer's Guide

Air purifiers effectively remove pollutants and improve indoor air quality, making them valuable for homes with allergies, pets, or smokers. When selecting a Blueair air purifier, consider several key factors to ensure you choose the right model for your space and needs. 


### Filter Technology

Blueair air purifiers employ a unique HEPASilent technology that combines a pre-filter, electronic air multiplier, and true H13 HEPA filter. This multi-stage filtration system captures particles as small as 0.1 microns, including dust, pollen, smoke, and bacteria. Understanding the filter's rating and efficiency will help you select the appropriate model for your specific air quality concerns.

### Coverage and Size

Measuring your room's square footage is crucial for selecting an appropriately sized air purifier. Blueair recommends one cubic meter of filter space per square meter of room area. For example, a 20-square meter room typically requires a purifier with a 20-cubic meter filter capacity. This ensures proper air circulation and effective filtration throughout the space. 


### Operating Noise

Air purifiers operate quietly to maintain a comfortable home environment. Blueair models range from whisper-quiet (22 dB) during low fan speed to 55 dB at maximum fan speed. Consider your sleep habits and daily activities to determine an acceptable noise level. Most users find the standard operating noise (35-45 dB) suitable for bedrooms and living rooms.

### Energy Efficiency

Energy consumption varies among Blueair models, with some being more energy-efficient than others. Look for models with a higher energy efficiency rating, which typically use less power while maintaining effective filtration. The difference may be noticeable on your electricity bill, especially in extended use scenarios.

### What makes Blueair air purifiers unique?

Blueair air purifiers stand out with their patented HEPASilent Technology, combining a washable pre-filter and a multilayer HEPA filter to achieve exceptional filtration efficiency. Unlike traditional purifiers, the HEPASilent Technology reduces air turbulence, resulting in quieter operation while maintaining superior air quality. 

These purifiers also feature advanced features like True HEPA filtration, activated carbon filter for odors, and quiet sleep mode for overnight use. They're backed by a comprehensive 5-year warranty and easy maintenance through washable filter systems. 


### Which Blueair model is right for my space?

The appropriate Blueair model depends on your room size and specific needs. The Blueair Blue Pure 211+ is suitable for small rooms up to 163 square feet, while the Blueair Blue Pure 212 covers larger spaces up to 326 square feet. For open-plan areas, the Blueair Blue Pure 211+ Wall-Mounted Model is space-efficient. 

Consider your primary concerns: if dust and pollen are your main issues, the standard models with True HEPA filtration will suffice. If you need extra odor removal, models with activated carbon filters are recommended. The wall-mounted model needs only 8 inches of wall space, making it ideal for small apartments.

### How much maintenance do Blueair purifiers require?

Maintenance is minimal with Blueair purifiers, primarily involving regular filter changes and occasional pre-filter cleaning. The washable pre-filter should be rinsed weekly in warm water, then air-dried before reinstallation. The washable dustbin needs emptying daily to prevent odors. 

The HEPA filter typically lasts 3-5 years with normal use, depending on your local air quality and pet ownership. For optimal performance, the washable post-filter needs monthly cleaning, while the activated carbon filter lasts 12-24 months based on usage and air quality. 


### What rooms are Blueair purifiers effective in?

Blueair purifiers excel in bedrooms, living rooms, and offices, removing airborne particles as small as 0.1 microns. They're particularly effective in rooms with pets, smokers, or dust-sensitive individuals. The wall-mounted model is space-efficient for small apartments, while the standard models work well in rooms up to 326 square feet. 

The purifiers perform best when placed in the center of a room on a flat surface at least 12 inches away from walls. They avoid placement near doors, windows, or air vents to maintain consistent airflow and filtration efficiency.

### Do Blueair purifiers emit ozone?

No, Blueair purifiers do not emit ozone. Their filtration systems work by combining washable pre-filters, True HEPA filters, and sometimes activated carbon filters to remove pollutants without adding harmful chemicals to the air. This makes them ideal for households with asthmatics, pets, or those concerned about chemical exposure. 

The company explicitly states on their website that all models are Ozone-Free Technology, ensuring pure air quality while removing allergens, dust, and odors. 


### What's the energy consumption of Blueair purifiers?

Blueair purifiers consume very little energy compared to their cleaning capacity. The Blueair Blue Pure 211+ uses just 35 watts during operation, making it one of the most energy-efficient air purifiers available. This model operates on a single 120V outlet and runs quietly at under 25 decibels. 

The larger Blueair Blue Pure 212 model uses slightly more energy at 55 watts during operation. However, both models consume minimal electricity and are suitable for daily use in residential settings without significant energy costs.
