## Buyer's Guide

Fly London sandals combine fashion and functionality, offering a wide range of styles suitable for various occasions. When selecting your pair, consider the following key aspects to ensure you find a comfortable, stylish option that matches your needs. 


### Sole Construction and Materials

The sole is the foundation of your sandals, affecting both comfort and durability. Look for soles made from rubber or TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane) for good grip and resilience. The upper layer should be made from breathable materials like leather, mesh, or synthetic fabrics to prevent moisture buildup during wear. 


### Strap Design and Adjustability

Pay attention to how the straps distribute pressure across your foot. Well-designed straps should wrap around the foot in a way that helps maintain the sandal's secure fit without causing discomfort. Look for sandals with adjustable straps or hooks to accommodate different foot shapes and sizes. 


### Heel Height and Stability

Sandals with moderate heel heights (2-3 inches) generally provide better stability than flat styles. If you prefer higher heels, consider ones with a slight heel grip or slight heel counter to prevent slippage. The heel base should sit evenly on the sole to prevent rocking and ensure even weight distribution. 


### Care Requirements and Warranty

Higher-quality sandals typically come with better warranties and more detailed care instructions. Most Fly London sandals should be cleaned with a mild soap solution and allowed to air dry naturally. Synthetic materials may require less maintenance than leather, so consider this factor based on your cleaning preferences and lifestyle. 


## FAQ


### Are Fly London sandals comfortable for daily wear?

Yes, Fly London offers a variety of footwear styles that prioritize comfort, making them suitable for daily wear. Their most popular styles feature padded insoles and flexible materials that reduce foot fatigue during extended wear. 

For maximum comfort, consider styles with wide heels, open-toe designs, or those featuring breathable mesh materials. The Fly London brand frequently collaborates with podiatrists to design shoes that meet both style and comfort standards. 


### What materials are Fly London sandals made from?

Fly London uses a combination of materials in their sandals, including synthetic leather, genuine leather, and water-resistant fabrics. Their synthetic leather options provide durability and a premium look without the cost of genuine leather. 

Water-resistant materials are particularly common in Fly London's beachwear collection, designed to protect your feet from sand and water while maintaining style and comfort. 


### How do I maintain Fly London sandals?

Regular maintenance can extend the life of your Fly London sandals. Use a soft cloth to wipe away dirt and dust, and treat water stains with a specialized leather cleaner. For particularly stubborn marks, consider using a leather restorer product recommended by the brand. 

Store your sandals in a shoe bag when not in use to prevent scuffs and retain their shape. If they develop an odor, let them air out in a cool, dry place, or use a specialized footwear deodorizer. 


### What sizes do Fly London sandals run in?

Fly London typically runs slightly smaller than US standards, particularly in women's sizes. It's recommended to measure your foot and compare it to their size chart rather than relying solely on your regular shoe size. 

Men's sizes generally correlate more closely with US standards, but it's still advisable to check their specific size chart as sizing can vary between styles and collections. 


### Are Fly London sandals suitable for hot weather?

Many Fly London sandals are designed specifically for warm weather, featuring breathable materials like mesh and open-toe designs. Their summer collections often incorporate moisture-wicking insoles and lightweight construction to keep feet cool. 

However, if you have wide feet or need additional foot support, consider styles with wider toe boxes or built-in arch support. These features can provide better comfort during extended wear in hot conditions. 


### How long do Fly London sandals typically last?

With proper care and regular wear, Fly London sandals can last between 1-3 years, depending on the quality of the materials and how frequently they are worn. Their synthetic leather and water-resistant options generally wear well in casual settings. 

Expect genuine leather styles to last longer, but they may require more frequent maintenance to retain their appearance. Fly London's most durable options often combine water-resistant materials with reinforced stitching in high-wear areas.
