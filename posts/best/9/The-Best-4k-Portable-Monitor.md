## Buyer's Guide

A 4k portable monitor combines high picture quality with on-the-go convenience, perfect for professionals who need crisp visuals while traveling. These displays offer several key features and specifications to consider before purchasing. 


### Display Resolution and Size

Look for a true 4k resolution (3840 x 2160 pixels) rather than lower resolutions with "4k" branding. Screen size typically ranges from 13 to 24 inches, with 15- to 17-inch models being most portable. 


### Refresh Rate and Response Time

For gaming or professional applications, seek a display with at least 60Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time. Creative professionals may prefer panels optimized for color accuracy over higher refresh rates. 


### Portability and Connectivity

Consider weight (under 4 pounds is ideal) and build quality (Rohm material often indicates durability). Most 4k portable monitors support HDMI 2.0b, DisplayPort, and USB-C for video and power delivery. 


### Power Consumption and Battery Life

Portable monitors consume significant power, so check local AC adapter efficiency. Some models offer battery-powered operation through USB-C, extending usable lifespan during travel.
