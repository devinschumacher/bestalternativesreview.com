## Buyer's Guide

A bike shed provides essential protection for your two-wheeled investment, safeguarding your bicycle from the elements while offering convenient storage. When selecting the right bike shed, consider several key factors to find a solution that meets your needs and complements your space.

Measure your available space and the size of your bicycles to determine the appropriate shed dimensions.
