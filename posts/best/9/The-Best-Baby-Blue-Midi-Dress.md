### What materials are commonly used in baby blue midi dresses?

The most common fabrics include cotton-linen blends for durability and comfort in warm weather, silk for special events requiring a more formal look, and polyester blends for versatile everyday wear. 


### How should I fit a baby blue midi dress?

Look for a dress that fits the body but allows for natural movement. A dress that sits slightly below the bust (typically 2-3 inches) and has a natural waist fit will create an elegant silhouette.
