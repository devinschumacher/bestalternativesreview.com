## FAQ


### What are beef cheek rolls?

Beef cheek rolls, also known as boeuf joue de bœuf, are a nutritious dog treat made from premium cuts of beef. These rolls are crafted from the cheek muscles of beef, known for their rich flavor and high protein content. 

The preparation process involves slow cooking and marinating, which enhances the meat's texture and makes it easier for dogs to chew and digest. These rolls are often shaped into convenient, bite-sized packages that can be given as rewards or treats. 


### What are the benefits of beef cheek rolls?

Beef cheek rolls offer several nutritional advantages. They contain high-quality protein, essential amino acids, and minerals like iron and zinc. The slow-cooking process also makes the meat more digestible, reducing the risk of stomach upset in dogs with sensitive digestive systems. 

Additionally, the consistent texture of these rolls helps maintain dental health by promoting saliva production and reducing plaque buildup. The rich flavor can also help manage begging behavior and improve training results by serving as an effective reward. 


### How do beef cheek rolls compare to traditional dog treats?

Compared to many traditional dog treats, beef cheek rolls typically offer superior nutritional value. They contain natural ingredients and are free from artificial preservatives, coloring, and additives commonly found in commercial dog treats. The premium beef also provides more substantial nutritional benefits, including complete protein profiles and essential vitamins. 

While beef cheek rolls are more expensive than many traditional treats, they offer long-term benefits for both the dog's health and the environment due to their responsible sourcing practices. 


### What precautions should I take when feeding beef cheek rolls?

While beef cheek rolls are generally safe, it's important to monitor your dog's reaction to new foods. Start with small pieces to ensure your dog tolerates the meat well, especially if they have dietary sensitivities. Dogs with specific dietary restrictions or health conditions should consult their veterinarian before introducing new treats. 

Always supervise your dog when they're eating these rolls to prevent choking hazards. If your dog shows any signs of discomfort, upset stomach, or allergic reactions, discontinue use and consult your veterinarian. 


### What storage requirements do beef cheek rolls have?

Unopened beef cheek rolls typically have a longer shelf life when stored properly. Store them in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Once opened, these treats should be refrigerated and used within 5-7 days for optimal freshness and safety. 

Always check for signs of spoilage before serving, such as off odors, changes in texture, or mold growth. Freezing unused portions can extend the shelf life, but refrigeration is recommended when maintaining freshness. 


### Are beef cheek rolls suitable for all breeds and ages?

Most dogs can enjoy beef cheek rolls, but size and age considerations apply. Small dogs and dogs with dental issues may need smaller pieces or softer alternatives. Senior dogs with reduced appetite should start with small pieces to ensure proper consumption and prevent choking hazards. 

Introduce new treats gradually to check for individual tolerance, especially in dogs with dietary sensitivities or health conditions. Always assess your dog's reaction and adjust portion sizes as needed to maintain a balanced diet and prevent digestive upset.
