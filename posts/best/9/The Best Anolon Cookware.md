## Buyer's Guide

Choosing the right cookware can significantly impact your cooking experience and the quality of your meals. Anolon cookware offers a range of products with distinct features, making it essential to understand what each type of cookware can offer based on your cooking needs. 


### Materials and Durability

Most Anolon cookware sets come in aluminum or hard-anodized aluminum with stainless steel interiors. Aluminum is lightweight and heats evenly, while hard-anodized aluminum provides superior durability and resistance to scratches and dents. Look for pots and pans with stainless steel interiors for easy cleaning and scratch resistance, though they may be moreprone to scratches from metal utensils.

### Heat Distribution

Effective heat distribution is crucial for consistent cooking results. Look for cookware with thick aluminum or copper cores that transfer heat evenly across the cooking surface. Many Anolon products incorporate these features to prevent hot spots and ensure reliable performance on stove tops and in ovens. 


### Cookware Features

Consider features that enhance usability and cooking convenience. Multi-ply construction, such as three-ply or five-ply, improves heat efficiency and reduces energy consumption. Stay-safe handles provide secure grip and prevent burns, while dishwasher-safe construction simplifies maintenance. Some sets include features like precision temperature control or non-stick coatings for specific cooking needs.

### Size and Compatibility

Choose cookware sizes that match your cooking and storage needs. Common sizes range from 1 to 8 quarts for pots and 8 to 16 inches for pans. Consider the diameter of your cooktop when selecting base sizes to ensure proper heat distribution. Most Anolon cookware features raised rims that prevent water spillage during boiling and provide a stable footprint for stovetop cooking. 


## FAQ

![Anolon-Cookware-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Anolon-Cookware-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What makes Anolon cookware unique?

Unlike traditional aluminum cookware, Anolon combines durable aluminum with their proprietary Hard-Anodized process, creating a non-stick surface that's scratch-resistant and maintains its performance over time. This innovation makes their cookware ideal for both everyday use and professional kitchens. 

The core of each pan features 100% aluminum, which heats up quickly and distributes heat evenly. The outer layers are hard-anodized aluminum, providing exceptional durability and scratch resistance. This construction ensures long-lasting performance and consistent cooking results. 


### How does Anolon's non-stick surface work?

Unlike conventional Teflon coatings that can degrade over time, Anolon's non-stick surface is made from durable PFOA-free material that bonds directly to the metal surface through their hard-anodizing process. This results in a surface that's 28% more slippery than traditional non-stick coatings, making it easier to release food and clean. 

The non-stick coating is also resistant to scratches, high heat, and harsh utensils. While you can use metal utensils, we recommend avoiding them for optimal performance and longevity. 

![Anolon-Cookware-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Anolon-Cookware-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What types of handles does Anolon offer?

Most Anolon cookware features their Tri-Ply handles, which combine metal, wood, and resin for a secure grip and even heat distribution. These handles withstand oven temperatures up to 425°F (220°C) and resist warping and cracking. 

Some larger pots and pans offer dual handles for better stability when cooking or serving. These are typically designed for oven-safe models and provide additional comfort when handling hot cookware. 


### Can Anolon cookware go in the dishwasher?

The hard-anodized construction of Anolon cookware makes it dishwasher-safe, but we recommend hand-washing for optimal performance and longevity. Dishwashers can damage the non-stick surface and affect the overall quality of the cookware over time. 

If you choose to hand wash, use mild soap and a soft sponge or cloth. Avoid abrasive cleaners and steel wool, which can scratch the non-stick surface and underlying metal. 

![Anolon-Cookware-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Anolon-Cookware-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What sizes do Anolon pots and pans come in?

Standard sizes for Anolon cookware range from 0.75-quart to 5-quart for individual cookware pieces, and 1.5-quart to 6-quart for sets. Most cookware features a 2.5-quart to 3-quart size, which is versatile for cooking pasta, rice, or small roasts. 

For larger cookware needs, Anolon offers 5-quart and 6-quart options suitable for family meals or entertaining. Their larger sizes are often available in both single pieces and as part of multi-piece sets. 


### How do I properly store Anolon cookware?

To store Anolon cookware, stack the smaller sizes in the larger ones if they have matching rims, as this maximizes space and protects the surfaces. Avoid stacking heavier cookware on top of smaller pieces to prevent scratches on the non-stick surface. 

Store cookware in a dry, cool place away from direct sunlight and extreme temperature changes. Using oven mitts when handling hot cookware prevents damage from thermal shock and protects your hands.
