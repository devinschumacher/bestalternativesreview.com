### How heavy are cane nightstands?

A typical cane nightstand weighs between 15-30 pounds, depending on the size and material quality. The solid hardwood cane versions tend to be heavier than those with metal frames. 

While lightweight enough to move, these nightstands provide a substantial presence due to their caned construction and often include drawers or open shelving.
