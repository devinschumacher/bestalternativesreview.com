### What is a jasmine rice cooker?

A jasmine rice cooker is a specialized kitchen appliance designed to cook jasmine rice to perfection, maintaining its distinct aroma and flavor. Unlike traditional rice cookers, these devices often feature temperature controls and additional functions like keep warm and delayed start. 

These cookers work by combining measured amounts of rice and water, then cycling through cooking, steaming, and warming phases to ensure even cooking and optimal moisture retention. 


### How do I properly measure rice for cooking?

Use a standard measuring cup to measure rice, as different brands may have varying grain sizes. Typically, 1 cup of uncooked jasmine rice yields about 3 cups of cooked rice. 

For the most accurate measurement, weigh the rice on a kitchen scale: 1 cup of uncooked jasmine rice usually weighs around 180 grams.

After each use, allow the cooker to cool completely before cleaning. Wipe the exterior with a damp cloth and wash the inner pot with mild detergent and warm water, taking care not to damage any heating elements.

### Can I cook other grains in a jasmine rice cooker?

Most jasmine rice cookers can safely cook other grains like brown rice, quinoa, or millet, though results may vary. Always refer to the specific model's user manual for recommended cooking times and water-to-grain ratios. 

For best results, check the cooker's compatibility with grains you plan to cook, as some models have specific settings or limitations for different grains.
