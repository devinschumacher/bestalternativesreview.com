## Buyer's Guide

Certo Drug Testing Solutions offer reliable at-home drug testing kits that help individuals monitor their substance use. These tests detect common drug types and provide quick results, making them a convenient option for personal use. 


### Testing Capabilities

Certo tests analyze saliva samples to detect recent drug use. The tests can identify marijuana, opiates, cocaine, methamphetamine, and amphetamines. Understanding which drugs are detectable and the specific cutoff times is crucial for accurate interpretation of results. 


### Sample Collection

Users provide a saliva sample by swabbing the inside of their cheek. The collection process should take 1-2 minutes and does not require specialized equipment. Proper hygiene and sample handling procedures ensure accurate test results. 


### Test Readout and Interpretation

After applying the saliva sample, the test card displays results in 5-15 minutes. Positive results indicate recent drug use, while negative results suggest no detectable drug presence. It's important to read the instructions carefully to correctly interpret the visual indicators on the test card. 


### Result Accuracy and Follow-Up

While Certo tests provide quick results, professional testing is recommended for legal or medical purposes. Factors affecting test accuracy include drug use frequency, type of drug, and time since last use. For repeat testing, maintaining consistent collection times and following manufacturer instructions ensures reliable results.
