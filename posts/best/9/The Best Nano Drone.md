## FAQ


### What is a Nano Drone?

A Nano Drone is an extremely small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with unique capabilities for tight spaces and subtle maneuvers. These drones typically weigh less than 25 grams and measure under 150mm in length, making them ideal for indoor use and espionage applications. 

Unlike standard drones, Nano Drones often feature advanced stabilization systems and multiple propellers for enhanced control and stability during operation. They excel in environments where larger drones would be impractical or harmful. 


### What are Nano Drones used for?

These miniature drones have diverse applications across industries. In security, they perform surveillance in restricted areas. For hobbyists, Nano Drones offer extreme portability and complex flight patterns as a challenge. Some are used for scientific research in confined spaces. 

The military also utilizes Nano Drones for reconnaissance missions in urban environments where larger aircraft cannot operate. Their small size allows them to collect data or perform tasks in locations previously inaccessible to traditional drones. 


### How do Nano Drones maintain stability?

Most Nano Drones employ advanced flight stabilization systems that combine multiple sensors and sophisticated software algorithms. These systems continuously monitor the drone's orientation and position to maintain stability during flight. 

Their design incorporates multiple small propellers instead of the standard two or four found on larger drones. This configuration provides exceptional stability and maneuverability, allowing the drone to maintain control even in turbulent air currents. 


### What are the legal considerations when operating a Nano Drone?

Operating a Nano Drone requires careful attention to local regulations. Many areas require registration and adherence to specific flight restrictions, particularly in urban environments. Always check local laws before operation. 

Privacy concerns also apply. Operating a Nano Drone near private property without permission may violate privacy laws. Respect property boundaries and obtain necessary permissions to avoid legal issues. 


### How long can a Nano Drone fly before needing a recharge?

Most Nano Drones offer flight times ranging from 5 to 15 minutes per battery charge, depending on the model and operating conditions. This limited flight time requires careful planning for extended missions. 

To maximize flight duration, maintain the drone within the recommended operating temperature range and avoid unnecessary accessory installations that can drain power. Regular maintenance of the battery also ensures consistent performance. 


### What maintenance does a Nano Drone need?

Basic maintenance includes regular inspection of propellers for damage, cleaning the drone to remove dust and debris, and checking the battery for proper voltage levels. Lithium-polymer batteries should be kept between 20-40°C to prevent damage. 

For more detailed maintenance, review the specific care instructions provided by the manufacturer. This may include checking motor oil levels, ensuring all connections are secure, and performing software updates for the flight controller.
