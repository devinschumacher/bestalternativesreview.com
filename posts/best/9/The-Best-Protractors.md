## Buyer's Guide

A protractor is a versatile tool essential for measuring and drawing angles. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the right protractor for your needs. 


### Types of Protractors

Standard protractors feature a semicircular arc with degree markings ranging from 0° to 180°. The center hole (commonly called the origin) allows the protractor to be fixed to a surface or drawn over it. Digital protractors offer electronic angle measurement and can display readings in both degrees and radians. These devices often include additional features like built-in calculators and angle tracking capabilities. 


### Accuracy and Durability

For precise measurements, opt for protractors made from durable materials like metal or high-impact plastic. The measuring scales should be clearly marked with minimal distortion. Digital protractors typically offer higher accuracy due to their electronic measurement systems, though they require careful calibration and power management. 


### Adjustable Versus Fixed-Angle Protractors

Adjustable protractors allow you to measure angles greater than 180° by flipping the base over. This feature is particularly useful for engineering and architectural applications. Fixed-angle protractors are simpler and more portable but have limited measurement range. 


### Additional Features

Some protractors include measuring tapes, ruler functions, or specialized scales for specific applications. Digital models may offer angle calculation functions, data logging, or wireless connectivity for measuring in hard-to-reach locations. Consider whether these features are necessary for your intended use to balance functionality with cost. 


## FAQ


### What is a protractor?

A protractor is a measurement tool used to measure and draw angles. It typically features two straight edges with a curved arc that measures angles in degrees. 

Basic protractors measure angles up to 180 degrees, while circular protractors can measure angles up to 360 degrees. Some advanced models include features like vernier scales for increased precision. 


### What materials are protractors made from?

Protractors are commonly made from plastic, which is lightweight and durable while providing precise measurements. Some premium models use metal or aluminum for increased rigidity and permanence. 

Plastic protractors are resistant to scratches and damage from accidental drops, making them ideal for everyday use in schools and educational settings. Metal protractors offer superior durability but can be more expensive and heavy. 


### How do you read a protractor?

 Align the protractor's baseline with one side of the angle, and ensure the center point of the protractor matches the angle's vertex. Read the measurement where the other side of the angle intersects the curved scale. 

For clockwise measurements, the scale starts at 0° on the right side and increases to 180° on the left. For counterclockwise measurements, the scale starts at 0° on the left and increases to 180° on the right. 


### What types of protractors are there?

Basic protractors feature a straight edge with a semicircular arc for measuring angles up to 180 degrees. These are the most commonly used for general measuring tasks. 

Circular protractors, also known as full-circle protractors, measure angles up to 360 degrees. They are particularly useful for measuring angles in circles or for finding the center of round objects. 


### What measurements can a protractor provide?

A standard protractor measures angles in degrees, allowing users to determine the size of angles in various applications, from geometry problems to engineering projects. 

Some advanced protractors include features like mil measurements for military and scientific applications, or Vernier scales for precise measurements in engineering and drafting. 


### How accurate are protractors?

Standard protractors provide measurements accurate to the nearest degree, suitable for most educational and general-purpose applications. 

Advanced protractors with Vernier scales or finer graduations can achieve measurements accurate to one minute (1/60th of a degree), meeting the precision requirements of engineering and scientific work.
