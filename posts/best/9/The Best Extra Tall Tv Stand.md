## Buyer's Guide

Extra tall TV stands are designed to accommodate oversized TVs while providing ample storage space. These stands often feature three or more levels and can reach heights of 6 feet or more. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you find a stand that matches your TV size, room dimensions, and storage needs. 


### TV Compatibility

To ensure proper fit and support, measure your TV's width, height, and depth. Most extra tall stands can accommodate TVs up to 65 inches diagonally, but check the specific model's specifications. Consider the stand's shelf depth, which should match your TV's back projection depth for optimal stability. 


### Stability and Weight Rating

Extra tall TV stands must be exceptionally stable due to their height. Look for models with four or more legs and distributed weight rating of at least twice your TV's weight. The stand should include wall-mounting options to prevent tipping, especially for heavier TVs over 80 pounds. 


### Storage Options

These stands typically offer multiple shelves and compartments. The upper shelves are ideal for your TV and cable box, while lower levels provide space for gaming consoles, streaming devices, and miscellaneous items. Consider open vs. closed storage: open shelving displays your gear but requires more regular dusting, while closed cabinets protect contents but reduce visibility. 


### Style and Finishes

Extra tall stands come in various styles, from modern minimalism to traditional wood finishes. The height and width of the stand should complement your room's dimensions. Glossy finishes are most resistant to fingerprints and scratches, but matte finishes offer better visual texture. Consider the stand's profile: sleeker designs work best in small spaces, while more ornate styles suit larger rooms. 


## FAQ


### What defines an extra tall TV stand?

Extra tall TV stands typically measure between 60 and 80 inches in height. These stands exceed standard TV stand heights, making them suitable for floor-standing televisions or as wall-mounted solutions in tall entertainment centers. 

They're ideal for displaying wall-mounted TVs that sit on a shelf beneath the screen or for freeing up wall space by storing components in the base of the stand. 


### How important is stability in extra tall TV stands?

Extra tall TV stands require superior stability due to their increased height and potential load-bearing capacity. Manufacturers incorporate features like heavier bases, anti-tip brackets, and reinforced construction to prevent tipping during installation and use. 

Always check the stand's stability rating and ensure it matches your TV's weight and size, following the manufacturer's guidelines meticulously to prevent accidents. 


### What materials are commonly used in extra tall TV stands?

Many extra tall TV stands utilize engineered wood, MDF, or composite materials on the exterior, offering durability and affordability. The internal frame often includes steel support structures and reinforced joints for added strength. 

Some premium models use solid wood construction with metal reinforcements, while others incorporate aluminum or stainless steel for a sleek, modern appearance with enhanced durability. 


### How do extra tall TV stands save space?

These stands save vertical space by moving the TV closer to the floor, freeing up wall height for other decorations or storage solutions. The base often includes built-in shelving or storage compartments for remote controls, cables, and gaming equipment. 

When paired with wall-mounted screens, extra tall stands eliminate the need for floor space entirely, making them ideal for small apartments or homes with limited room for furniture. 


### What maintenance requirements do extra tall TV stands have?

Regular maintenance for extra tall TV stands includes checking screws and bolts, cleaning the surface with appropriate cleaning solutions, and inspecting the stand for any cracks or damage. Most finishes can be maintained with standard furniture care products. 

Check the stability brackets and TV mounting system annually to ensure they remain secure and properly adjusted. Address any issues immediately to prevent accidents and maintain the stand's longevity. 


### Are extra tall TV stands difficult to assemble?

While extra tall TV stands may require more space for assembly and have more pieces than standard stands, many models include detailed instructions and pre-drilled holes for easier installation. Some models even come with wall-mounted options for complete setup guidance. 

Heavy-duty construction means more bolts and screws, so expect assembly times of 2-3 hours. Consider purchasing from reputable stores that offer setup services if you're concerned about the installation process.
