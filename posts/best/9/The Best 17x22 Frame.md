## Buyer's Guide

A 17x22 frame offers a generous display area for photos and artwork while maintaining manageable dimensions. When selecting this frame size, consider the following key factors to ensure you choose a frame that complements your piece and fits your needs. 


### Display Requirements

To properly display your 17x22 inch artwork, look for a frame with a matching internal dimension. Consider the frame's depth, as standard matting solutions often add about 1.5 inches to the overall width and height. This means the frame itself should ideally measure no more than 18.5x23.5 inches to allow ample space for mounting and matting materials. 


### Matting and Mounting Options

Popular matting choices for 17x22 frames include acid-free mounting mats and dust covers. These protect your artwork while enhancing its presentation. The mat should snugly fit within the frame's borders, with about 1/8 inch of exposed artwork around the edges for a clean look. 


### Frame Style and Materials

Popular materials include wood, metal, and composite frames. Wood offers traditional elegance but requires regular care to prevent warping. Metal frames are durable and available in various finishes. Composite frames combine strength with lightweight construction and are less prone to damage. 


### Maintenance and Long-term Care

Consider frames with UV protection to prevent fading, and choose materials that resist yellowing over time. Opt for frames with secure mounting options to prevent tipping, especially if hanging in high-traffic areas. Regular cleaning with appropriate materials will maintain your frame's appearance and protect your artwork. 


## FAQ


### What is a 17x22 frame?

A 17x22 frame is a specific size category for picture frames, measuring 17 inches in height and 22 inches in width. The term "frame" refers to the mounting and protective border around a piece of artwork or photograph. 

These frames are popular for featuring medium-sized prints, artwork, or photographs that require professional framing. 


### What materials are 17x22 frames typically made from?

Common materials include wood, metal, and acrylic. Wood frames may be painted or finished in various styles, while metal frames combine durability with lightweight design. Acrylic frames offer excellent protection without the weight of glass. 

Composite materials can also be used for modern, sleek frames that combine strength with minimal profile. 


### How much space do I need to display a 17x22 frame?

For wall mounting, consider a space roughly 19 inches (height) by 24 inches (width) to allow for proper hanging and viewing area. 

When placing the framed piece on a tabletop or shelf, ensure there's at least 2 inches of clearance around all sides for easy viewing and access. 


### What types of artwork work well with 17x22 frames?

These frames excel with 8x10 inch photos, 11x14 inch prints, and standard artwork sizes. They provide an elegant border for both black and white photos and color prints. 

The frame's style should complement the artwork. For example, a contemporary metal frame works well with modern photography, while a wood frame pairs nicely with classic portraits. 


### How do I properly hang a 17x22 frame?

Use a compatible picture hanger, typically rated for 20 pounds or more. The hanger should sit approximately 6 inches below the frame's top edge for optimal support. 

Ensure the picture hook is securely attached to wall studs or use wall anchors for drywall. Level the frame before securing it to prevent sagging or misalignment. 


### What maintenance does a 17x22 frame need?

Regularly check the frame for any loose hardware and inspect the glass or acrylic for scratches or damage. Wipe the frame's exterior with a soft cloth using mild soap and water as needed. 

If the artwork becomes dusty, use a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment to gently remove particles. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners that could damage the frame's finish.
