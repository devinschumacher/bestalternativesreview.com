## Buyer's Guide

Roxy footwear combines style and functionality for active lifestyles. When selecting Roxy shoes, consider factors like intended use, fit, and material quality to find the right pair for your needs. 


### Intended Use

Roxy offers shoes for various activities, including skateboarding, surfing, and casual wear. Determine your primary use to guide your selection, as different activities have specific footwear requirements. 


### Fit and Size

Proper fit is crucial for Roxy shoes. Most models run true to size, but some variants like the Vulcun may require half-size adjustment. Allow extra room for socks and consider the specific model's fit characteristics. 


### Material Quality

The quality of materials affects durability and performance. Look for reinforced stitching, quality leather or synthetic construction, and sturdy soles. Higher-quality materials typically provide better longevity and support. 


### Additional Features

Consider features like padding, moisture-wicking, and grip. Padded lining can enhance comfort during extended wear, while moisture-wicking helps prevent foot sweat. Grip patterns on the sole improve traction for specific activities. 


## FAQ


### How do Roxy shoes compare to other surf shoe brands?

Roxy shoes stand out in the surf shoe market for their combination of style and performance. They offer high-quality construction with durable materials that can handle the rigors of the water. Roxy's designs tend to be more fashion-forward than some competitors, making them a popular choice among surfers who prioritize both function and appearance. 

While other brands like Quiksilver and Billabong also offer reliable surf shoes, Roxy often provides better value for money with its balance of style, comfort, and performance features. 


### What sizes are Roxy shoes available in?

Roxy shoes typically offer a standard range of sizes from 6 to 13 for men and women's styles. They tend to run true to size with a slight preference towards roomier fits. To ensure the best fit, it's recommended to try on shoes in-store or consult Roxy's size guide on their website. 

Roxy occasionally offers wider width options, particularly in their women's sizes, but these may vary by style. Always check specific product pages for available width options. 


### What materials are Roxy shoes made from?

Roxy shoes use a variety of materials to balance durability and water resistance. The uppers typically feature synthetic leather or mesh panels with water-blocking technology. The soles incorporate rubber compounds specifically designed for beach and water traction. 

Some premium styles may include additional materials like Gore-Tex for enhanced water resistance or reinforced toe caps for added protection during wipeouts. 


### How should Roxy shoes be cared for?

Roxy recommends machine washing their shoes in a mesh bag to prevent snagging and damage. The shoes can be washed with mild detergent and normal cycle settings, avoiding excessive scrubbing of the soles. 

After washing, Roxy shoes should be air-dried completely before wearing. Avoid using heat sources or direct sunlight, as these can damage the materials and affect the shoes' performance. 


### Are Roxy shoes suitable for all beach activities?

While designed primarily for surfing, Roxy shoes provide decent protection and traction for various beach activities. They work well for paddleboarding, beach volleyball, and casual beach walking. 

For activities requiring more specialized footwear (like swimming or snorkeling), Roxy shoes may not offer the necessary features. Their primary function remains as water-resistant beach footwear for surfers and beachgoers. 


### How long do Roxy shoes typically last?

With regular use, Roxy shoes typically last 2-3 years with proper care, depending on the frequency of use and environmental factors. The rubber soles usually wear down first, followed by the upper materials. 

To extend the lifespan of your Roxy shoes, avoid extended submersion in saltwater, store them properly when not in use, and replace them when signs of wear appear, such as scuffs on the rubber sole or fading of the synthetic leather.
