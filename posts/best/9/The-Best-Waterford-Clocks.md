### [Godinger 3" x 4" Waterford Crystal Mantle Clock](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Waterford+Clocks?utm\_term=godinger-3-x-4-waterford-crystal-mantle-clock)

![Godinger 3" x 4" Waterford Crystal Mantle Clock | Image](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcRUWEa5oEUB5sua4gL6azw5ZV0a4SWvaE-e8AvO3Mt8OG3xu7Ggb3kBYJKBpezXrw3I0WP8FE7ftO9YaOSZEM1mi8xbm4jTR7MKKEuVpy43u7V2l01OJDE2ig&usqp=CAY)

The Waterford-inspired crystal mantel clock has a delicate glass frame that holds an analog metal dial. Reviews note that while the crystal looks impressive, the plastic clock face can be delicate and prone to scratches. The clock keeps decent time and looks elegant on a nightstand or bathroom vanity, though the tick can be noticeable. 


### [Waterford Style Clock with Nightingale Melodies](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Waterford+Clocks?utm\_term=waterford-style-clock-with-nightingale-melodies)

![Waterford Style Clock with Nightingale Melodies | Image](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcSBL7NxZ87kHmxQBKMwhutipeKX2Bd0Hi1JWiNH4dpdM9VyjuS8UX5cV1xSpjz13ntenFbzduRP2sk6I8YcLEY2TNVP0xXslD\_0ON36uBCOUAsHW8Dz8Bd9hg&usqp=CAY)

This poorly constructed waterford clock combines cheap plastic framing with delicate crystal accents that sit uncomfortably within a Styrofoam-wrapped mechanism. The bulk of the unit's weight comes from its 2.6-pound body, despite its 9-inch width. Powering six AA batteries into a device that fails to keep reliable time, this clock manages to be both overpriced and underwhelming in its execution. 


### [Waterford Lismore Diamond Clock](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Waterford+Clocks?utm\_term=waterford-lismore-diamond-clock)

![Waterford Lismore Diamond Clock | Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcShD\_Dxo5\_QWxfuMsO1zrR0ltISgj39kbCUN44KV9a4QwUycjiwXIOcBMDF1k7ZBfxpULdbprP0qtu3FhSuRYOLMd1SSHsd&usqp=CAY)

This elegant Waterford clock brings timeless Irish craftsmanship into your home, featuring the brand's signature Lismore pattern with its distinctive diamond and wedge cuts. The clear crystal design lets in plenty of light, though it's small enough to fit perfectly on a nightstand or shelf.

An elegant grandfather clock with Howard Miller's signature attention to detail, the Bellair Cherry finish and polished brass pendulum combine traditional style with modern convenience. The quartz movement keeps accurate time while the adjustable chime volume lets you customize the Westminister chime to your preference. 


## Buyer's Guide

The Waterford clocks from the renowned Irish crystal manufacturer combine elegant design with precise timekeeping. This guide examines the key factors you should consider when selecting a Waterford clock, helping you find a piece that matches your style and needs. 


### Crystal Quality and Condition

The crystal transparency, cut quality, and presence of air bubbles are crucial indicators of a Waterford clock's craftsmanship. Premium pieces feature clear crystals with sharp facets and no visible imperfections. The glass protective cover should sit perfectly flush with the crystal face. 


### Movement and Battery Life

Waterford typically uses reliable quartz movements in their clocks. Consider the battery life, with most requiring replacement between 1.5 to 3 years. For models with special features like alarms or radio reception, ensure the movement can support these functions without compromising accuracy. 


### Case Construction and Materials

The clock's case should be made from high-quality materials such as solid wood, metal, or crystal. Pay attention to the case's finish and any decorative elements. The case construction should protect the movement while complementing the crystal display. 


### Size and Style Compatibility

Measure the available space and consider the clock's visual impact. Waterford offers both traditional and contemporary styles, so match the design aesthetic of your room. The clock's proportions â€“ particularly the ratio of height to width â€“ affect its visual balance.
