## FAQ


### What colors are included in Crayola Oil Pastel sets?

Crayola offers various Oil Pastel sets with different color palettes. The 48-Crayon and 24-Crayon sets feature a wide range of primary and secondary colors, metallics, and pastel shades. 

Some key colors available in their standard sets include: Cadmium Yellow, Permanent Rose, Prussian Blue, Emerald Green, Copper Pearl, and Ivory White. The 48-Crayon set also includes specialty colors like Black Opaque and Titanium White. 


### How are Crayola Oil Pastels different from regular oil pastels?

While Crayola Oil Pastels share similar properties with standard oil pastels, they offer improved color intensity and better lightfastness. This means the colors are more vibrant and resist fading over time. 

These pastels also have a smoother application and produce less visible strokes, making them ideal for detailed artwork and coloring pages. 


### What makes Crayola Oil Pastels blending-friendly?

Crayola Oil Pastels contain a special blend of waxes that allow for easy color mixing and layering. This formula enables smooth transitions between colors and subtle gradations, perfect for creating realistic effects. 

The consistent pastel stroke also makes it simple to adjust color intensity by applying multiple layers. This blending capability extends the versatility of each color. 


### Are Crayola Oil Pastels suitable for all ages?

While these pastels are ideal for casual coloring and artistic expression, they're best suited for children 6 years and older due to their stick-like shape and wax content. Younger children should use them under adult supervision. 

The 72-crayon and smaller sets make excellent choices for classrooms, crafting sessions, and travel, offering a broader color range without the inconvenience of carrying the full 128-crayon set. 


### How should Crayola Oil Pastels be stored?

Store Crayola Oil Pastels in a cool, dry place with their lids tightly closed to prevent crayon breakage and maintain their integrity. The included plastic cases protect the pastels during storage and transport. 

Avoid storing them near heat sources or direct sunlight, as this can soften the pastels and affect their texture. Using the crayons in their original packaging helps preserve their quality and prevents loss of color intensity. 


### How do Crayola Oil Pastels clean up?

Clean Crayola Oil Pastels with a damp cloth or paper towel immediately after use to remove any excess color. For persistent marks, use soap and water on a soft sponge or cloth, then rinse with water. 

Color removal from clothing and surfaces can be challenging. Before use, test a small area to determine appropriate cleaning methods. For tough stains, consider using a dry-cleaning solvent or specialized oil pastel cleaner.
