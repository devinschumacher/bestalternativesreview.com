From the folks who brought you the 108, the Big Fish 103 brings pedal-powered fun to a new level with its sleek, camo finish and roomy 400-pound capacity. Stand up and fish in comfort thanks to the multi-position seat that turns your kayak into a floating platform. Whether you're after big fish or just a relaxing day on the water, this pedal drive kayak has you covered, though you might want to invest in a trailer—because at 100 pounds without the seat and motor, it's no lightweight. 


## Buyer's Guide

A fishing kayak with motor combines the convenience of motorized propulsion with the versatility of manual paddling, making it an ideal choice for serious anglers. This guide outlines key features and considerations to help you find the perfect kayak for your fishing needs. 


### Engine Options and Performance

Fishing kayak motors range from 6 to 25 horsepower, with most anglers opting for 10-15 HP models. Key factors to consider include motor type (outboard or electric), fuel efficiency, and top speed. Outboard motors provide greater power but require regular maintenance, while electric motors offer cleaner operation and quieter performance.

### Cargo and Storage

Storage capacity is crucial for fishing equipment. Look for kayaks with multiple compartments, rod holders, and dry storage options. The total volume of storage space, as well as its accessibility, should match your gear requirements. Consider whether you need space for overnight trips, live bait containers, or fishing equipment. 


### Stability and Comfort

For extended fishing trips, stability is essential. Sit-on-top designs generally offer better stability than sit-inside models, but sacrifice some storage space. The kayak's length affects both stability and maneuverability - longer kayaks track better but may be less maneuverable in tight quarters. Seat comfort, including backrest adjustments and padding quality, also impacts long-term usability.

### Warranty and Durability

A robust warranty protects your investment. Consider kayaks with warranties covering both the hull and motor. Durability materials like rotomolded polyethylene resist punctures and corrosion, while fiberglass offers lighter weight but requires more maintenance. The kayak's construction quality, including seams and deck durability, should match your intended use (e. g. , freshwater vs. saltwater, calm lakes vs. open water).

### What is a fishing kayak with motor?

A fishing kayak with motor combines the portability and stability of a traditional kayak with the propulsion power of an electric or gas motor. This versatile watercraft allows anglers to reach remote fishing spots more easily and cover greater distances than they could paddling alone. 

These hybrid kayaks typically feature a longer, more aerodynamic hull design optimized for motorized propulsion, while maintaining the tracking characteristics that make kayaks efficient paddling vessels. 


### What are the key features to consider when choosing a fishing kayak with motor?

Important factors include motor type and thrust capabilities, foldable or compact design for storage and transport, storage options for gear and tackle, and navigation aids like fishfinding sonar or lights for night fishing. 

Additional considerations should focus on the kayak's weight capacity, tracking ability in various water conditions, and ease of assembly and maintenance.

### How do fishing kayak motors work?

Most fishing kayak motors are electric, operating on standard batteries that can be recharged from shore or a vehicle. They come in two main configurations: outboard motors attach to the rear of the kayak, while inboard motors are integrated into the hull design. 

The motor's propeller drives the kayak through the water when activated, requiring minimal steering input from the operator. Most motors offer multiple speed settings for different water conditions and boating needs. 


### What maintenance requirements do fishing kayak motors have?

Regular maintenance includes checking the motor's battery charge, cleaning the propeller and shaft, and examining the motor housing for signs of damage or water infiltration. Many motors need oil changes and filter replacements at regular intervals, as specified in the manufacturer's guidelines. 

A thorough seasonal inspection should be performed before each fishing season to ensure all components are in good working order, from the motor itself to the connecting hardware and wiring.

### Can you use a regular kayak motor on a fishing kayak?

While some regular kayak motors can be adapted for use on fishing kayaks, compatibility depends on the specific motor design and the kayak's motor mount configuration. Most fishing kayaks require specialized motors designed specifically for their hull and mounting system. 

To avoid compatibility issues and potential damage, it's advisable to purchase a motor that's explicitly designed for your fishing kayak model, as indicated in the manufacturer's specifications. 


### What is the maximum safe operating speed for fishing kayak motors?

The typical maximum operating speed for fishing kayak motors ranges from 5 to 10 miles per hour, depending on the motor's type and power output. Most recreational fishing kayaks are designed for calm to moderate water conditions, where such speeds are sufficient for navigation and fishing. 

Operating at higher speeds can increase the risk of water ingress through seams and fittings, and may exceed the design capabilities of the motor, potentially causing damage or reduced performance.
