### What are ancestral supplements?

Ancestral supplements are nutrition products inspired by traditional diets of our evolutionary predecessors. These supplements aim to address modern dietary deficiencies through formulas based on nutrient-dense foods that prehistoric humans likely consumed. 

The ingredients typically include vitamins, minerals, and trace elements found in plants and animal products from natural, unprocessed sources. These supplements often focus on key nutrients like Omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, and antioxidants that were consistently present in ancestral diets. 


### Are ancestral supplements safe for everyone?

Most ancestral supplements are safe when taken as directed, but they may interact with medications or medical conditions. Some supplements, like fish oil, may thin the blood and affect clotting. 

People with autoimmune diseases, bleeding disorders, or those taking blood thinners should consult their doctor before starting any new supplement regimen.
