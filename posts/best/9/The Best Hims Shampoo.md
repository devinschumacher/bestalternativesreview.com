Hims Shampoo contains key ingredients like minoxidil 1% for female pattern hair loss and ketoconazole 2% for dandruff and scalp irritation. These ingredients help address specific scalp and hair concerns, making the shampoo suitable for various conditions. 

The formula is designed for all hair types and genders, but it's important to note that clinical studies show the most effective treatments for female hair loss and scalp conditions, making Hims Shampoo particularly beneficial for these specific concerns. 


### How does Hims Shampoo work?

The minoxidil in the formula helps increase blood flow to hair follicles, while the ketoconazole combats dandruff by fighting scalp fungi. This combination can improve scalp health and promote hair growth over time. 

For best results, use Hims Shampoo daily as directed, giving your scalp and hair several weeks to respond to the active ingredients.

### Can men use Hims Shampoo?

Yes, men can use Hims Shampoo. The formula is versatile enough to benefit both genders, though men may be more likely to try it for hair loss prevention or dandruff treatment. 

Men with female pattern hair loss should particularly consider this shampoo, as it contains the clinically studied minoxidil concentration known to promote hair growth in men. 


### How long does it take to see results?

Visible scalp improvements may occur within 2-4 weeks, but noticeable hair growth typically takes 4 months or longer. Patience is important, as hair growth occurs gradually and consistently. 

Continue using the shampoo as directed, as stopping treatment too early may prevent reaching the full potential of the product's effects.

### Is Hims Shampoo safe for daily use?

Yes, Hims Shampoo is safe for daily use due to its clinically tested concentrations of minoxidil and ketoconazole. However, irritation or sensitivity may occur in rare cases. 

If you experience persistent redness, itching, or other adverse reactions, consult a dermatologist before continuing use. 


### How should I store Hims Shampoo?

Store Hims Shampoo at room temperature away from direct sunlight and heat sources. Avoid freezing, as temperature changes can affect the product's stability. 

The shelf life is approximately 24 months from the production date, so check the expiration date before use to ensure optimal effectiveness.
