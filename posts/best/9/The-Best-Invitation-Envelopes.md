## Buyer's Guide

Invitation envelopes are crucial for crafting memorable first impressions, whether you're planning a wedding, birthday celebration, or corporate event. The right envelope can protect your invitation while making a stylish statement. Here's what you need to consider when selecting the perfect envelope for your event. 


### Material Quality

Higher-end paper stocks, such as vellum or coated cardstock, offer better protection for your invitation and leave a premium impression. Standard options include recycled paper and kraft envelopes for more eco-friendly choices. 


### Size Compatibility

Ensure your envelope matches the size of your invitation. Common sizes include A2 (4 1/8" x 5 3/4"), A7 (5 1/2" x 8 1/2"), and C6 (3 7/8" x 5 7/8"). Oversized invitations may require specialty envelopes. 


### Window Options

Windows allow guests to see the event details at a glance. Choices include clear, white, gold foil, or pearlescent options. Consider the text color and design when selecting window type to maintain readability. 


### Sealing and Addressing

Self-sealing envelopes require precise folds, while envelope envelopes allow for easy opening and reclosing. For professional events, consider adhesives like double-sided tape or envelope glue for secure sealing. 


## FAQ


### What are invitation envelopes used for?

Invitation envelopes are specifically designed to protect and present wedding, event, and party invitations. Their premium materials and elegant designs elevate the look of your invitations while keeping them pristine during mailing. 

These envelopes come in various sizes to match standard invitation sizes, with the most common being 4 1/8" x 5 ½". Quality envelopes often have high-quality liners and windows for personalized addresses. 


### What are the different types of invitation envelopes available?

Common types include standard white, cream, and ivory envelopes, while premium options include cotton, hemp, and recycled materials. Special finishes like metallic foils, glitter, and holographic effects are available for more ornate designs. 

Design elements vary from simple flat envelopes to decorative styles with flaps, tassels, and die-cut shapes. Multi-piece sets combining different styles or textures are also popular. 


### How do you properly address an invitation envelope?

Address the envelope using standard mailing guidelines, with the recipient's name and address clearly written on the front. If using a window envelope, print the return address on the pre-paid reply envelope and place it inside. 

Always check for proper alignment and legibility of the address, and consider using address labels or a mailing service for accuracy. 


### What size invitation envelope should I choose?

Standard invitations measure 4 1/8" by 5 ½", requiring a 4" by 6" envelope. Oversized invitations may need a 4 1/2" by 6 1/2" envelope, while square invitations typically fit in 5" by 5" envelopes. 

Check your invitation's dimensions against envelope sizes to ensure a perfect fit, considering both the invitation and any attached enclosure. 


### How much sealing tape should I use on invitation envelopes?

Use about 3/4 inch of sealing tape centered near the envelope's top edge. This provides enough adhesion while preventing damage to the envelope's creased area. 

If sealing multiple envelopes, keep the tape aligned to maintain a professional appearance across your invitation set. 


### What's the difference between window and flat invitation envelopes?

Window envelopes display the return address through a clear plastic window cut into the envelope, requiring the return address to be printed on the envelope itself. They are more economical and efficient for mailing. 

Flat envelopes completely enclose the invitation within the envelope, offering better protection but requiring additional sealing tape and potentially more space for addressing.
