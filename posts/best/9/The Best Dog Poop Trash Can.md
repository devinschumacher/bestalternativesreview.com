### Materials and Durability

Most dog poop trash cans are made from plastic, which resists tearing and provides better odor containment than metal. Look for a sturdy construction with premium seals on the lid. Premium models may feature reinforced bases and heavy-duty walls to withstand frequent use.

### Capacity and Design

Capacity ranges from 10 to 40 gallons, with larger sizes suitable for households with multiple dogs or larger breeds. Consider a can with a built-in dispenser for biodegradable poop bags, which allows for easier and cleaner disposal. The shape should be wide-mouthed for easy access while preventing the lid from floating off. 


### Odor Control and Maintenance

Effective odor control features include activated carbon filters, odor-blocking gaskets, and double-bag systems. Consider cans that allow you to add odor-absorbing crystals or baking soda. Regular cleaning with mild soap and water, followed by thorough drying, is essential for maintaining hygiene.

### Installations and Placement

Mounted models save space and prevent theft, but ensure they're attached securely to prevent tipping. For ground-level cans, choose a stable base with anti-tip features. Consider placement near your yard's primary entry point or garden area, where the can won't be out of sight.
