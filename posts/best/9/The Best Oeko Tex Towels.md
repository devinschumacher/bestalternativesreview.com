## Buyer's Guide

Oeko Tex towels combine exceptional quality with reliable certification, making them a popular choice for discerning consumers. Understanding what to look for in Oeko Tex towels can help you select a product that meets your needs while providing peace of mind about its safety and durability. 


### Size and Dimensions

Oeko Tex towels come in various standard sizes that fit common bathroom fixtures. Common dimensions include 60x120 cm for bath towels and 30x60 cm for hand towels. Consider your space and usage frequency to choose the right size ratio for your towels. 


### Material Quality

The primary materials used in Oeko Tex towels are cotton, bamboo, and microfiber blends. Higher-quality materials typically result in softer, more absorbent towels that retain their shape better over time. Look for towels made from at least 100% cotton or blended materials with premium cotton content. 


### Construction and Weave

The towel's construction affects its thickness, absorbency, and texture. Higher-thread-count weaves create thicker, more absorbent towels, while lower-count weaves produce thinner, more lightweight options. The towel's construction should match your intended use - thicker towels for heavy-duty drying, thinner ones for everyday use. 


### Finishing and Edging

Quality Oeko Tex towels feature well-finished edges that prevent unraveling and maintain their shape. Look for towels with double-needle stitching, flat-felled seams, or ribbed edges. The towel's overall seam quality should be consistent across the entire piece. 


## FAQ
