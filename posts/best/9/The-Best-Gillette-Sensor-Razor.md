## Buyer's Guide

The Gillette Sensor Razor series has established itself as a reliable choice for both casual and frequent razor users. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the right model for your grooming needs. 


### Safety and Comfort Features

Look for multiple cutting blades to improve shaving efficiency while reducing irritation. The Sensor series typically offers 5 or more blades, with additional dedicated cutting blades designed for facial hair. Comfort features like 3D foil technology distribute blade pressure evenly and pivoting blade edges follow the contours of your face more closely. 


### Handle Design and Ergonomics

The grip surface should have a secure, non-slip texture, especially important when shaving in the shower. The handle shape should fit comfortably in your hand, with no sharp edges or awkward angles that might cause discomfort during use. The length and curvature of the handle affect reach, making some models more suitable for facial hair on different parts of your face. 


### Head Flexibility and Maneuverability

Check how the razor head moves relative to the blade and lather application system. The Sensor series features heads with independent blade blocks that move more freely, allowing better access to angles and hard-to-reach areas. The pivoting action of the blades helps maintain consistent contact with the skin, even when shaving at different angles. 


### Maintenance and Durability

Pay attention to how easy it is to disassemble and clean the razor head, as this affects both performance and hygiene. Durable materials in the handle and head assembly indicate a longer-lasting product. The base of the razor should be well-constructed to prevent warping or bending, which can affect cutting performance over time. 


## FAQ


### What makes the Gillette Sensor Razor different from other razors?

The Gillette Sensor Razor features SensorBlade technology with multiple blades that glide closer to the skin for a closer shave. Unlike traditional razors, it includes SkinGuard technology with sensors that adjust blade height for better comfort during shaving. 

The SensorBlade system consists of three blades and three precision cuts, while the SkinGuard has three protective strips that prevent irritation. Each blade is engineered for specific cutting angles to remove facial hair effectively while minimizing shaving bumps and razor burn. 


### How long do the blades last, and when should I replace them?

The blades typically last through several uses, depending on your shaving habits. Most users find they need to replace the SensorBlade every 4-6 weeks, or when they notice the blade quality has declined and their skin feels more irritated. 

To maintain blade performance, rinse the razor thoroughly after each use, remove excess hair from the blade, and store it in a dry place. Regular blade maintenance extends their lifespan and ensures a closer shave. 


### Can I use the Sensor Razor on sensitive areas like the neck and underarms?

Yes, the Sensor Razor is suitable for use on sensitive areas. The built-in SkinGuard technology helps protect these delicate areas by adjusting blade height and providing three protective strips that prevent irritation. 

For extra sensitivity, use a lubricating shaving cream or gel to reduce friction and enhance comfort during shaving. Always follow the natural hair growth direction when shaving these areas to minimize irritation. 


### What types of handles are available, and which is most comfortable?

There are three main handle designs available: Sensor, Sensor Flex, and Sensor Fusion. The Sensor has a straight handle, while the Sensor Flex features a slightly curved design, and the Sensor Fusion includes an ergonomic grip with a more pronounced curve. 

The most comfortable handle depends on your personal preference and grip style. The Sensor Fusion typically offers the best grip thanks to its wider, more contoured design, making it suitable for users with larger hands or those who prefer a firmer grip. 


### How should I maintain the razor between uses?

After each use, thoroughly rinse the razor under running water to remove hair and skin particles. Gently remove any excess hair from the blade using a pin or small brush to prevent clogging. Store the razor in a dry place to prevent rust and maintain blade quality. 

Every few weeks, give the razor a more thorough cleaning by soaking it in warm water with mild soap. This helps remove built-up residue and extends the life of the blades and handle. 


### What's the difference between Sensor and Sensor Fusion razors?

The primary difference is in the handle design. The Sensor features a straight, traditional handle, while the Sensor Fusion incorporates an ergonomic grip with a more pronounced curve. The Sensor Fusion typically offers better control and comfort, especially for users with larger hands or those who prefer a firmer grip. 

Both models feature the same SensorBlade technology with three blades and three precision cuts, as well as SkinGuard technology with three protective strips. The Sensor Fusion adds a slightly more cushioned grip and improved finger placement for enhanced shaving control.
