## Buyer's Guide

Chobani Flip containers offer a convenient way to store and transport your favorite Greek yogurt, with several key features that influence their performance and versatility. Understanding these aspects will help you select the right size and style for your needs. 


### Capacity Options

The most common capacities range from 4 to 11 ounces, each offering different advantages. Smaller sizes are ideal for single servings or portable portions, while larger options provide more yogurt per container for home storage. 


### Material Quality

Most Chobani Flips are made from BPA-free plastic, ensuring safety for food storage. The thickness and durability of the material affect how well they stack, maintain their shape, and resist leaks when transported. 


### Sealing Mechanism

Each flip top has a sealing mechanism that prevents air and moisture from affecting the yogurt's quality. Some designs feature better resealability than others, so look for models with tight seals that maintain freshness over multiple uses. 


### Design Considerations

While basic designs work well, consider containers with spill-proof lids or secure clips for added peace of mind during transport. The shape and ergonomics of the handle also impact usability, especially for single-handed operations.
