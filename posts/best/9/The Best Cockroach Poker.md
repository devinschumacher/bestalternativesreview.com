This fast-paced card game adds a silly twist to bluffing with critters instead of traditional poker cards. Players pass and call out animal types while trying not to be caught in a web of lies. The game's brief 15-20 minute duration makes it perfect for quick bursts of fun, though there's enough strategy to keep it interesting longer than that.

The InVict gel bait works differently from conventional roach baits, thanks to its unique formula that even attracts those notoriously bait-averse critters.

Each 4-pack is a good starting point for tackle those German roaches that seem immune to other treatments.
