Back of door storage solutions maximize vertical space while keeping clutter out of living areas. These practical additions to your home's wardrobe can transform how you organize coats, shoes, and accessories. Understanding the key features will help you select a system that matches your needs and home style.

### Storage Capacity and Design

Think about what items you'll store and choose a configuration that matches their size and type. Open shelves work well for display purposes, while door-mounted cabinets offer more concealed storage. Consider adding adjustable shelves to accommodate different item sizes. 


### Mounting Options

Door mounting systems vary in their attachment methods. Some use adhesive strips, while others require screws. Evaluate which method best suits your door's material and your comfort level with DIY installation. Ensure the mounting system you choose supports the weight of your intended stored items.

### Style and Finishes

Back of door storage units come in a wide range of materials and finishes to match your interior design. Common materials include metal, plastic, and wood. The finish should complement your door's color and style without overwhelming the space. Consider how visible the storage unit will be from different angles and decide if a concealed or decorative design works best. 


## FAQ

![Back-Of-Door-Storage-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Back-Of-Door-Storage-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What types of back of door storage are available?

Back of door storage solutions include hooks, key racks, magnetic strips, and sliding doors. Hooks and key racks are ideal for lightweight items like coats and keys. Magnetic strips work well for hanging metallic items such as tools and knives. Sliding doors provide concealed storage space for larger items like winter coats and sporting equipment. 

The best type depends on your specific storage needs and available space. Consider factors like item weight, frequency of use, and desired accessibility when selecting a storage solution. 


### How do magnetic strips work?

Magnetic strips attach to the back of doors using built-in magnets. They feature multiple hooks or slots that can hold lightweight metal items like tools, knives, and scrap metal. The magnetic force keeps these items securely in place, preventing them from falling off the strip. 

Most strips measure 12-24 inches long and can support up to 30 pounds per strip, depending on the specific model. They typically require 20 minutes to install and work best with smooth metal doors. 

![Back-Of-Door-Storage-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Back-Of-Door-Storage-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What materials are back of door hooks made from?

Back of door hooks come in various materials, including plastic, metal, and wood. Plastic hooks are lightweight and resistant to warping, making them ideal for frequent cleaning and humid environments. Metal hooks offer greater durability and support for heavier items, while wood hooks provide a decorative option that matches natural wood doors. 

Most hooks measure 6-12 inches in length and have a diameter of 1-2 inches. They typically hold between 10-20 pounds per hook, depending on the material and design. 


### How do I properly measure for back of door storage?

To measure for back of door storage, start by measuring the door's width at its widest point. Subtract the thickness of the door itself and any existing hardware (like locks) to determine the available space. Consider the overall height and where you want to position the storage solution. 

For magnetic strips and hooks, measure the remaining space horizontally across the door. This will determine how many pieces you can install and the total storage capacity. For sliding doors, measure the height and width of the door opening to find the appropriate model. 

![Back-Of-Door-Storage-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Back-Of-Door-Storage-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do I install back of door storage?

Installation varies by product type: Magnetic strips: Align the strip with your measurement, mark the mounting points, and use appropriate screws or brackets to secure it to the door. Magnetic strips typically require 20 minutes to install. Hooks and key racks: Measure and mark your desired locations, drill pilot holes, and install wall anchors. Hang the hooks or key rack by their mounting points. This usually takes 15-30 minutes per piece. Sliding doors: Measure the door opening, mark the mounting points, and drill holes for track mounts. Install the top and bottom tracks, then attach the door panel. This process requires basic tools and takes approximately 2 hours. 


### How much weight can back of door storage hold?

Back of door storage solutions vary in weight capacity: Hooks: Standard hooks hold 10-20 pounds per hook, depending on the quality and design. Industrial-grade hooks can support up to 30 pounds. Magnetic strips: Most magnetic strips support 30 pounds per strip, with premium models holding up to 50 pounds. Slides: Double-sided sliding systems typically support 60-70 pounds per unit, while tall or wide models may handle less. Always check the manufacturer's specifications before installation. 

Important considerations include the number of items, their weight, and how frequently they'll be removed. Group similar items and avoid overloading a single storage solution to ensure safety and longevity.
