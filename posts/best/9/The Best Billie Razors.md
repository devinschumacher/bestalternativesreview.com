![Billie-Razors-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Billie-Razors-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Core Components

The razor's body typically features a durable plastic construction with ergonomic handles for comfortable grip. The blade mechanism consists of a sturdy frame that securely holds the replaceable blades in place. The guard on Billie razors serves a dual purpose: it helps maintain a consistent shaving angle and provides additional protection to prevent nicks or cuts during use. 


### Blade Considerations

Billie razors use single-blade cartridges that are available separately for convenient replacement. The blade quality affects both the closeness of the shave and skin irritation levels, so premium-grade stainless steel blades are essential for optimal performance. Proper blade maintenance, including regular cleaning and storage in a dry environment, extends their lifespan and ensures consistent results.

### Maintenance and Storage

Regular maintenance involves cleaning the blade after each use to prevent buildup and maintain sharpness. The razors should be stored in a dry place, either in their provided case or with the blade covered to prevent oxidation. Proper care extends the lifespan of the razor and ensures continued smooth operation during each use.
