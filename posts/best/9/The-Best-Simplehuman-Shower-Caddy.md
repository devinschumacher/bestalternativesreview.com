## Buyer's Guide

A shower caddy is a practical addition to any bathroom, offering convenient storage for toiletries and personal items. When selecting a shower caddy, consider the following features and factors to ensure you choose the right product for your needs. 


### Storage Capacity

Measure the available space in your shower to determine how much storage capacity you need. Consider the size of your toiletries and how many items you typically use during a shower. Look for caddies with adjustable shelves or modular designs for customizable organization. 


### Water Resistance

Shower caddies are exposed to moisture, so water resistance is crucial. Choose caddies made from materials like waterproof PVC, stainless steel, or solid plastic. Avoid wood or uncoated metal products that can warp or rust in humid environments. 


### Installation Options

Most shower caddies come with adhesive strips for simple wall mounting. However, consider caddies with suction cups or adjustable mounting brackets for added security. For heavier items, look for caddies with built-in hooks that can be attached to shower rods or exposed bolts. 


### Style and Aesthetics

Select a shower caddy that matches your bathroom's style. Options range from sleek, contemporary designs to vintage and farmhouse styles. Consider the color and finish to ensure it complements your existing fixtures and decor.
