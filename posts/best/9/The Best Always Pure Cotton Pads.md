## Buyer's Guide

Always Pure Cotton Pads offer a simple yet effective solution for various personal care needs, from makeup removal to intimate hygiene. Understanding their key features and benefits will help you choose the right product for your specific requirements. 


### Material Quality

These pads are made exclusively from cotton, a natural material that's soft against your skin and biodegradable. The purity of the cotton determines how well the pads can perform their intended functions while minimizing irritation.

### Sizing and Quantity

Consider the number of pads per pack and their dimensions. For daily use, 100-200 pads in various sizes (small, medium, large) offer flexibility. The pads should be thick enough to hold moisture effectively but not so bulky that they're awkward to use. 


### Application and Absorption

The pads' absorbency and application properties are crucial. Look for pads that can easily pick up makeup or other substances while maintaining their shape. The surface texture should allow for smooth application while removing products without leaving residue.

### Environmental Impact

Since these pads are cotton-based, their environmental impact depends on how they're produced and disposed of. Choose brands that use sustainable cotton farming practices and offer recycling programs for used pads to minimize waste.

### What makes Always Pure Cotton Pads different from regular pads?

Always Pure Cotton Pads are made from 100% cotton, offering a natural and breathable alternative to traditional pads. Unlike some cotton pads on the market, these are not pre-treated with chemicals or coatings. 

Their pure cotton construction helps prevent irritation and provides better moisture absorption, which can be particularly beneficial for sensitive skin or during heavy flow days. 


### How do these pads compare to organic cotton pads?

While both options use natural materials, Always Pure Cotton Pads are made from traditional cotton rather than certified organic cotton. This means they may still have traces of conventional farming chemicals. 

That said, the 100% cotton composition makes them a more eco-friendly choice than many non-organic pads available in the market.
