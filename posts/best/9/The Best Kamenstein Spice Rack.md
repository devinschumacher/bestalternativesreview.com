### Can Kamenstein spice racks be installed in any kitchen?

For optimal use, consider the available cabinet or countertop height. The racks are approximately 12 inches tall, with additional height when closed cabinets are installed above. 


### How should Kamenstein spice racks be cleaned?

Regular maintenance of your Kamenstein spice rack requires wiping down each shelf and door with a damp cloth. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials that could damage the finish. 

Occasionally, you may need to remove the doors and shelves for more thorough cleaning. The acrylic doors and stainless steel surfaces both maintain their appearance with proper care.
