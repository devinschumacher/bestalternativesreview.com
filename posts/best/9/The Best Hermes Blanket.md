## Buyer's Guide

The classic Hermes blanket combines superior craftsmanship with timeless design, making it a covetable addition to any home. Understanding its key aspects helps in selecting a quality piece that will last for generations. 


### Quality Materials

Better Hermes blankets use 100% cashmere, though some later models incorporate acrylic blends to maintain affordability. Look for blankets where the cashmere content is prominently displayed, as authentic pieces should indicate at least 10% cashmere content. 


### Construction Details

Authentic Hermes blankets exhibit precise stitching and consistent seam placement. The blanket's fold should match perfectly on all sides, and edges should be cleanly finished. The weave pattern should be uniform, with no visible unevenness. 


### Care Requirements

High-quality cashmere requires special care to maintain its shape and softness. Opt for blankets that include detailed care instructions, typically recommending hand washing or dry cleaning. The blanket should feel plush yet sturdy to the touch, indicating proper treatment during manufacture. 


### Design Elements

Since 1986, Hermes has marked its blankets with serial numbers and specific design codes. These codes help authenticate the piece and indicate its date of manufacture. The brand's signature stripe pattern should be crisp and consistent, without fading or unevenness. 


## FAQ


### What's special about Hermes blankets?

Hermes blankets combine premium craftsmanship with luxurious materials. Each blanket is made from the finest cashmere and silk blends, hand-finished in France to ensure durability and comfort. 

The brand's dedication to quality is evident in every detail, from the meticulous stitching to the soft texture that improves with each wash. 


### Are Hermes blankets machine washable?

While Hermes blankets can be machine washed, they must be handled with care. We recommend using a gentle cycle with cold water and a mild detergent to preserve their quality. 

Airing is the preferred method for drying. If needed, reshape the blanket while it's still slightly damp to maintain its intended form. 


### How do I store my Hermes blanket?

To store your Hermes blanket, roll it rather than folding it to minimize creasing. Use a breathable cotton cover if available to protect it from dust and damage. 

Store in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight to prevent color fading and maintain the material's integrity. 


### How often should I wash my Hermes blanket?

Washing frequency depends on usage. As a general rule, wash your Hermes blanket after every 3-4 uses to maintain hygiene and prevent odors. 

Regular washing also helps maintain the softness of the cashmere and silk fibers. 


### Can Hermes blankets be dry cleaned?

While professional dry cleaning is an option, it's not necessary for every wash. Dry cleaning can be harsh on cashmere, potentially damaging the fibers and altering the blanket's shape. 

For optimal results, follow the manufacturer's recommendations and consider home washing when possible. 


### What are the dimensions of Hermes blankets?

Hermes produces several blanket sizes, including 140 x 180 cm (4 feet 7 inches by 5 feet 11 inches) and 160 x 200 cm (5 feet 3 inches by 6 feet 7 inches). The specific measurements can vary slightly between styles. 

These measurements provide a standard guide for the brand's blankets, though minor variations may exist between different models.
