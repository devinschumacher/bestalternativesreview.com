## Buyer's Guide

A quality turntable brings vinyl back to its analog roots, offering a rich musicalexperience that modern electronics can't quite replicate. Before you drop yourrecord collection onto the needle, consider these key factors to find a turntablereally worth spinning your classics on. 


### Build Quality and Design

Select a turntable with solid construction that isolates the platter from external vibrations. Look for a plinth (base) made from heavy materials like aluminum or steel, and metal platters that spin on glass bearings for minimal wobble. The tonearm should be adjustable for tracking weight and counterbalance, ensuring precise needle positioning. 

![Fluance-Turntable-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Fluance-Turntable-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Audio Performance

Higher-end turntables use direct-drive motors or belt-driven systems for cleaner sound. These should have adjustable platter speed options and precise speed control to maintain optimal rpm. The pickup cartridge needs to be properly aligned and matched to your record's groove depth. Consider upgrading to a premium cartridge if you're serious about sound quality. 


### Connectivity and Compatibility

Basic turntables output line-level signals, while more advanced models offer phono preamps and USB outputs for direct digital recording. Some have built-in speakers, but these often sacrifice audio quality. Ensure your chosen turntable works with the power amp or interface you plan to use. 

![Fluance-Turntable-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Fluance-Turntable-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Value and Future-proofing

Entry-level turntables start around $100 with basic functionality, while premium models exceed $1000 for professional-grade performance. Consider your listening habits - if you play records weekly, invest in better components than monthly use. Read reviews to see if the features justify the price point, and think about whether you want future-proof capabilities like digital connectivity or built-in streaming. 


## FAQ

![Fluance-Turntable-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Fluance-Turntable-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What sets the Fluance turntable apart from other entry-level models?

Unlike many budget turntables, the Fluance features a premium aluminum platter with a steel sub platter, reducing vibrations and improving overall sound quality. The direct drive motor provides consistent rotation without the pitch variations found in belt-driven models. 

The built-in phono preamp and MM/MC cartridge compatibility make it versatile for different record types, while the included remote control adds convenience for adjusting settings. 


### How does the Fluance's build quality compare to other tabletop models?

The aluminum platter and steel sub platter construction give the Fluance a significant advantage over cheaper plastic alternatives. The robust aluminum build and metal platter reduce resonances and provide better stability, even at higher volumes. 

While some might compare it to similar models from other manufacturers, the Fluance's use of metal materials and direct drive motor sets it apart in terms of longevity and sound performance. 

![Fluance-Turntable-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Fluance-Turntable-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What types of records work best with the Fluance?

The MM (moving magnet) cartridge included with the Fluance is ideal for most contemporary vinyl releases. It excels with modern rock, pop, and electronic music, where clarity and bass response are important. 

For older or more delicate records, the included stylus protector helps prevent damage. The turntable's compatibility with MC (moving coil) cartridges via the Phono MM/MC switch makes it suitable for specialized collections. 


### Can I use the Fluance with my home audio system?

Yes, the Fluance includes a built-in phono preamp, allowing direct connection to most stereo systems. The turntable's high output level ensures reliable signal transfer to your amplifier or receiver without the need for additional components. 

If your system requires a different input level, you can purchase a simple phono preamp kit that fits the Fluance's connection port. 

![Fluance-Turntable-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Fluance-Turntable-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How much space do I need for the Fluance?

At 11.75 inches tall and 11.5 inches in diameter, the Fluance requires minimal space while still providing a premium tabletop presence. The aluminum platter and metal sub platter give it a commanding visual presence without taking up excessive room. 

The included remote control and power supply unit require additional space behind or next to the turntable, so consider this when planning your setup. 


### How much does the Fluance weigh?

The Fluance turntable weighs 22 pounds, with its aluminum platter and metal construction contributing to its substantial presence. The metal sub platter and motor assembly add significant weight to reduce vibrations and improve stability during playback. 

Despite its weight, the turntable is designed for tabletop use and won't require additional wall mounting or stabilization.
