## Buyer's Guide

Electric longboards combine the thrill of traditional skateboarding with the convenience of electric power, making them an increasingly popular choice for both casual riders and experienced skateboarders. When selecting an electric longboard, several key factors will influence your choice, including motor type, deck size, battery capacity, and control features. 


### Motor Power and Performance

The motor determines your board's acceleration, top speed, and carrying capacity. Common motor types include brushless outrunner motors and brushed motors. Brushless outrunners typically offer better efficiency and longer lifespan but are more expensive. Consider the motor's wattage rating and torque specifications to match your weight and intended use. 


### Deck Size and Construction

Deck dimensions impact stability, turning radius, and comfort. Standard sizes range from 38" to 48", with wider boards offering more stability at the expense of maneuverability. The deck's construction materials affect weight, durability, and response time. Common materials include bamboo, maple, and composite materials. The deck's thickness influences its flex characteristics, with thinner decks providing more direct feedback to the rider. 


### Battery and Range

The battery provides the electrical power for propulsion. Capacity is measured in watt-hours (Wh), with higher capacities offering longer ranges but at greater weight and cost. Common capacities range from 200 to 1000 Wh, with higher capacities requiring larger, heavier batteries. Consider your typical commute distance and maximum range needed for your intended use. 


### Control Features and Safety

Modern electric longboards incorporate various control features to enhance both functionality and safety. Key features include regenerative braking, which captures energy during braking to extend range, and speed limiting to prevent excessive speeds. Consider boards with displays showing battery life, speed, and distance traveled for rider feedback. Safety features like LED lighting, toe guards, and deck tape improve visibility and protection during nighttime or low-light conditions. 


## FAQ


### What is an electric long board?

An electric long board is a type of personal transportation vehicle that combines the length and stability of a traditional skateboard with an electric motor for propulsion. Unlike regular skateboards, these boards feature a motor mounted between the trucks, enabling riders to travel farther and faster with less effort. 

Electric long boards typically range from 3 to 5 feet in width and can support riders weighing between 80-300 pounds, depending on the specific model. The board's length usually falls between 7 and 10 feet, providing ample space for stable foot placement and extended riding sessions. 


### What are the benefits of electric long boards?

Electric long boards offer several advantages over traditional skateboarding and other forms of transportation. They require less physical exertion, making them suitable for all ages and fitness levels. The motor assistance allows for easier street navigation and improved performance on hills, while the extended battery life enables longer rides without recharging. 

The primary benefits include convenience, environmental friendliness, and safety. Electric long boards reduce the need for motor vehicles in short trips, contributing to lower emissions and quieter urban environments. The stable platform and electric assist make them safer for both experienced riders and new users. 


### What factors should I consider when choosing an electric long board?

When selecting an electric long board, several factors influence the best choice. Consider the board's size and shape to match your body type and riding style. Longer boards provide more stability at higher speeds, while shorter, wider boards excel in urban environments with narrow pathways. Choose a motor power rating that matches your intended use - lighter boards for commuting, heavier ones for recreational use or competition. 

Key technical specifications include the motor's wattage, battery capacity, and maximum speed. These determine the board's performance characteristics, such as acceleration, range, and top speed. Also, evaluate the construction quality, including the deck material, truck durability, and overall build integrity. 


### How do electric long boards handle different terrain?

Electric long boards perform well on various terrains, with some models specifically designed for particular environments. Smooth, paved surfaces offer the best performance, allowing for optimal motor efficiency and effortless riding. While capable of handling inclines, the board's motor assist becomes less effective on steep or rocky terrain. Many modern boards feature adjustable settings that help maintain control and efficiency across different conditions. 

Riders report that electric long boards excel on flat terrain, with most models maintaining controlled glide during descent. The motor assists in starting and accelerating, but manual pushing may be required on steep downhills. The board's stability and motor performance significantly impact its ability to handle rough or narrow paths, requiring users to adjust their technique and expectations based on the terrain type. 


### What is the typical range and charging time?

The range of an electric long board varies by model, typically falling between 6 and 25 miles per charge. Factors affecting range include motor efficiency, rider weight, terrain, and settings. Heavier riders, faster speeds, and less efficient setups reduce overall range. Most boards feature a LED battery indicator showing remaining power levels. 

Charging times range from 2 to 6 hours, depending on the battery capacity and charger type. Standard wall chargers provide an 80% charge in about 3 hours, while some high-capacity batteries require overnight charging. Quick chargers reduce this time but may not reach full capacity as efficiently. 


### Are electric long boards suitable for all riders?

Electric long boards accommodate a wide range of users, from casual riders to competitive enthusiasts. The board's weight capacity typically ranges from 80 to 300 pounds, making them accessible to most individuals. However, users with mobility impairments may need additional adaptations or alternative mobility solutions. 

Beginners find electric long boards easier to learn on due to the reduced physical effort required. Children under 10 years old usually need a board specifically designed for their weight and skill level. Most manufacturers recommend riders practice basic techniques before attempting tricks or advanced maneuvers.
