## Buyer's Guide

When selecting a Portland Timbers jersey, several factors will influence your choice, including the match you plan to wear it to, your preferred style, and the level of fan support you desire. This guide will help you understand the key aspects to consider when purchasing an official Timbers jersey. 


### Match-Specific Features

Official Timbers home and away jerseys include match-specific designs. Home match jerseys typically feature the club's primary colors and design elements, while away jerseys incorporate neutral tones and secondary colors. Check the specific match you'll be attending to select the appropriate jersey style. 


### Technical vs. Casual Options

Timbers jerseys range from highly technical match kits to casual fan wear. Technical jerseys prioritize moisture-wicking, ventilation, and compression for optimal performance during matches. Casual options focus on comfort, durability, and the club's design elements for everyday wear. 


### Size and Fit Considerations

Timbers jerseys run slightly small, particularly in the chest and sleeve areas. Consider ordering one size larger than your typical shirt size for a more relaxed fit. Also, note that moisture-wicking materials can feel snug when wet, so measure while wearing similar undergarments to achieve your desired fit. 


### Support Level

Official Timbers jerseys range from entry-level options for casual fans to premium kits featuring club crest embroidery, heat-sealed numbers, and anthem embroidery. Consider your level of support and intended use when selecting the appropriate support level for your jersey. 


## FAQ


### What materials are used in the Portland Timbers jersey?

The Portland Timbers home jersey features a lightweight, moisture-wicking polyester blend that helps players stay dry during matches. The away jersey uses a similar polyester construction but incorporates a slightly different color scheme. 

The fabric is machine washable and designed to maintain its shape and color after multiple washings. While the primary material is polyester, the jerseys also include spandex for stretch and improved mobility. 


### What sizes are available for Portland Timbers jerseys?

Jerseys are available in sizes ranging from small to 3X large, with additional XXL and 3X options for the home and away versions. The club offers youth sizes in S through 2X small, perfect for young fans. 

Due to the manufacturer's size guidelines, it's recommended to refer to the specific size chart when placing an order. The club also offers limited sizes in plus and petite options for women's jerseys. 


### How do I care for my Portland Timbers jersey?

Machine wash the jersey using cold water and a mild detergent. Turn the jersey inside out before washing to protect the printed graphics. Avoid using bleach or fabric softeners as they can damage the print quality. 

Air dry the jersey after washing to maintain its shape and prevent shrinking. If you choose to dry it in a dryer, use a low heat setting and remove it promptly to avoid any potential shrinkage. 


### What is the difference between home and away jerseys?

The home jersey features the team's primary colors, while the away jersey typically sports a neutral color scheme to help players stand out against different backgrounds. The away jersey also uses the same lightweight polyester construction as the home version but with distinct team graphics. 

Both jerseys include essential features like moisture-wicking fabric, reinforced stitching, and technical elements designed for optimal performance during matches. 


### Are these jerseys available in licensed versions?

The Portland Timbers work closely with official licensing partners to offer both home and away jerseys through their authorized retailers. These partnerships ensure you receive a genuine, licensed product with all associated rights and protections. 

While some unofficial options may exist, purchasing from the club's official retailers or their licensed partners guarantees authentic merchandise with proper legal protections. 


### How can I find my ideal fit?

Refer to the specific size chart provided by the manufacturer for accurate measurements. Generally, the home and away jerseys share the same sizing system, with the primary difference being the color scheme rather than fit variations. 

If you fall between sizes or have specific fit preferences (e. g. , body type or style preference), it's advisable to measure yourself and compare your measurements to the size chart for the most accurate fit.
