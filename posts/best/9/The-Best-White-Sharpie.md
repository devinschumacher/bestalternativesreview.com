## Buyer's Guide

White Sharpies are versatile markers that can add creative flair to any project. Choosing the right one depends on your specific needs and intended use. This guide helps you understand key features and considerations to find the perfect white Sharpie for your creative endeavors. 


### Visibility and Contrast

White Sharpies stand out on colored or dark surfaces, making them ideal for highlighting, underlining, and creating attention-grabbing designs. The brightness and opacity vary by brand, so test samples to see which provides the best visibility for your work. 


### Application and Control

These markers come in different tip sizes, from fine for detailed work to broad for quick strokes. The flow of ink affects writing and drawing consistency. Some have adjustable caps to control pressure and line width, giving you more precision during use. 


### Durability and Erasability

White Sharpies vary in their resistance to fading, water, and chemicals. For permanent applications, look for markers with waterproof, UV-resistant formulas that maintain their brightness over time. Erasable options are available for drafts and temporary markings, though they may not be as visible initially. 


### Value and Refills

Consider the cost per use and whether refills are readily available. Some brands offer packs at a lower cost per marker, while others provide robust cases that protect your tools. For regular users, the convenience of refills can extend the life of your markers and prevent waste. 


## FAQ


### What makes a White Sharpie different from regular Sharpies?

White Sharpies use a specialized reversible ink that allows writing and erasing on most surfaces. The ink becomes visible only when heat is applied, creating a white, non-permanent marking that can later be erased. 

This unique feature distinguishes White Sharpies from standard Sharpies, which use permanent ink. They're ideal for temporary markings and easy corrections in various environments. 


### What surfaces can I use a White Sharpie on?

White Sharpies can be used on most plastic, glass, metal, and laminated surfaces. They work particularly well on white boards and similar materials that require reversible marking. 

The ink becomes visible at temperatures above 280°F (138°C), allowing for writing on surfaces that might melt conventional markers. 


### How do I erase writing with a White Sharpie?

Writing with a White Sharpie becomes visible when heated to above 280°F (138°C). To erase it, you can use heat from a hair dryer, heat gun, or iron set to its highest setting without pressure. 

Typically, five to ten seconds of heat is sufficient to make the writing erasable. The process may need to be repeated two or three times for thicker marks. 


### How long does a White Sharpie marking last?

Once heat-activated, White Sharpie marks remain visible until erased. The longevity of the writing depends on the surface and environmental factors, with most marks lasting several days to weeks on standard surfaces. 

For best results, use White Sharpies in environments with controlled temperature and prevent exposure to extreme heat or cold, which can affect ink stability. 


### Can I write with a White Sharpie below 280°F?

Standard White Sharpies require heating to above 280°F (138°C) to make the writing visible. At lower temperatures, the ink remains invisible and non-scratchable. 

If you attempt to write below this temperature, the marker will not function, and any attempt to use it will result in no visible marks or scratching of the surface. 


### Are White Sharpies suitable for outdoor use?

While White Sharpies work well on several indoor surfaces, their effectiveness outdoors can vary due to exposure to direct sunlight, humidity, and temperature fluctuations. 

For outdoor applications, especially in extreme conditions, consider test-marking the intended surface before committing to permanent or long-term markings.
