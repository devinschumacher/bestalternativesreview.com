## FAQ


### What is the primary function of a Moultrie Deer Feeder?

Moultrie Deer Feeders distribute deer pellet or grain feed in a controlled manner, typically using photoelectric or thermal sensors to detect approaching deer. This prevents feed waste from scattering and helps protect the food source from non-target animals. 

These feeders are designed to improve deer nutrition, particularly in winter or during deer season when natural food sources may be limited. They can also help wildlife managers monitor deer populations. 


### How reliable are Moultrie Deer Feeders?

Moultrie feeds are known for their durability and reliability. Most models come with a two-year warranty and feature corrosion-resistant construction and weatherproof design suitable for outdoor use. 

Common issues include feeder jams, sensor malfunctions, and electrical problems. Proper maintenance and regular inspection can prevent most reliability issues, though occasional service may be required. 


### What maintenance is needed for Moultrie Deer Feeders?

Basic maintenance includes cleaning the feeding port after each use to prevent clogs, checking the sensor lens for dirt or damage, and ensuring all mechanical parts move freely. The feeder should be wiped down regularly with a damp cloth and mild soap. 

Deeper cleaning might be needed quarterly to remove built-up residue. Replace batteries when the power indicator light shows low battery, usually every six months to a year depending on usage frequency. 


### How much maintenance is required for installation?

Installation typically requires minimal maintenance beyond securing the feeder to a post or mounting bracket and adjusting the feeding height. The base plate and mounting hardware should be checked annually for tightness and stability. 

Inspect the mounting point for erosion or corrosion, especially if the feeder is in a harsh environment. Rodent barriers may be needed around the mounting base to prevent damage. 


### What are the feeding rate options?

Most Moultrie feeders offer adjustable feeding rates from 1/2 to 2 pounds per activation. Some newer models feature precise controls for customizing the amount of food dispensed, while older models may have fixed or standard feeding rates. 

Feeder capacity varies by model, typically ranging from 15 to 25 pounds of feed. Larger capacities are available for seasonal or long-term feeding stations. 


### How do Moultrie Deer Feeders prevent waste?

Feeder design features like sloped sides, precise dispensing mechanisms, and protective domes reduce scatter and spillage. The photoelectric or thermal sensors trigger feed delivery only when needed, preventing food from being exposed for extended periods. 

Maintenance plays a significant role in preventing waste. A clean feeding port and proper sensor calibration ensure accurate triggering, while regular cleaning prevents residue buildup that can affect feeding patterns.
