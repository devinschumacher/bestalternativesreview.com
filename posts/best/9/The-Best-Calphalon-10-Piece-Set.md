### How is the non-stick surface treated on Calphalon cookware?

The non-stick coating is oven-safe up to 450°F (232°C) and resistant to scratches and wear from typical kitchen utensils. Unlike some non-stick coatings, this treatment maintains its performance over time without releasing harmful chemicals. 


### What maintenance requirements do the Calphalon pieces have?

Regular maintenance includes hand washing with dish soap and soft sponges. The cookware is dishwasher-safe, but hand washing helps preserve the non-stick surface and maintain the original color. 

To extend the life of the cookware, avoid using metal utensils, which can scratch the non-stick coating. The cookware should also be stored with care to prevent damage to the handles and rims. Regular cleaning and proper storage help maintain optimal performance and appearance.
