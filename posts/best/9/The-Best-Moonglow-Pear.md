## Buyer's Guide

The Moonglow Pear combines luscious flavor with striking appearance, making it a standout addition to any fruit collection. Understanding the key aspects of this variety helps you select and enjoy the best specimens. 


### Cultivar Characteristics

The Moonglow Pear matures in mid-fall, offering a balance of sweet and tangy flavors. Its pale yellow skin often features a golden hue, with a distinctive blush that ranges from soft pink to deep red. The flesh offers a creamy texture that holds together well when eating or cooking. 


### Size and Shape

Moonglow Pears typically range from 6 to 8 inches in length, with some varieties growing up to 10 inches. The shape is oval to pear-shaped, with a moderate taper from base to stem. The fruit's size makes it suitable for both eating and cooking. 


### Maturity and Ripening

This pear variety requires 180 to 200 days from bloom to harvest, making it a later-season cultivar. Proper ripeness is indicated by a slight give when gently pressed near the stem end, and the yield of the fruit when lifted. Optimal ripening occurs at room temperature, with a week needed for softening after harvest. 


### Storage and Handling

Moonglow Pears ripen after picking, so it's best to harvest them when they reach full color but remain firm. Store unripe fruit at room temperature until nearly soft, then refrigerate to slow further ripening. Handle gently to avoid bruising, which can affect both quality and shelf life.
