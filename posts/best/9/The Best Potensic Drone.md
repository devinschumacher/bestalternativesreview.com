### Battery Life and Range

Look for drones with at least 15-20 minutes of flight time on a single charge for recreational use. The range (how far the drone can be controlled) typically varies between 500-1,000 meters for Potensic models, though line-of-sight flying is recommended for safety.

Their user-friendly control systems and intuitive app interface make them accessible to new drone pilots while still offering enough customization options for more experienced flyers. 


### What are the key technical specifications of a Potensic drone?

### How durable are Potensic drones in various weather conditions?

While Potensic drones are designed to handle light rain and mist, they're not recommended for heavy rainfall or immersion in water. The mainframe is built to withstand occasional light snow and can operate in temperatures ranging from -10° to 45°C. 

The drone's camera and sensor modules are protected by weather-sealed enclosures, ensuring reliable performance in varying environmental conditions. However, always err on the side of caution during extreme weather events. 


### What is the setup process for a Potensic drone?

![Potensic-Drone-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Potensic-Drone-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can Potensic drones be flown indoors?

While Potensic drones feature obstacle sensing technology that helps prevent collisions in close quarters, they should not be flown indoors due to limited space and potential interference with Wi-Fi signals. The recommended minimum safe indoor flying space is 7x7x7 meters (23x23x23 feet). 

Outdoor flying is recommended for the best performance and safety. The drones work best in open spaces at least 30x30 meters (100x100 feet), allowing for proper distance between the pilot and obstacles. 


### What maintenance does a Potensic drone require?

Regular maintenance includes checking the propellers for damage, cleaning the camera lens with appropriate cleaning solutions, and inspecting the battery for any signs of wear. The drone's gimbal and camera module should be dusted and inspected monthly. 

After each flight, make sure to store the drone in a dry place with the propellers removed. The brushless motors and electronic components need protection from dust and debris to maintain optimal performance.
