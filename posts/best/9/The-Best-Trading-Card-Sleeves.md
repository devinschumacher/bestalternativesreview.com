## FAQ

![Trading-Card-Sleeves-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Trading-Card-Sleeves-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


###  What materials are trading card sleeves made from?

Most trading card sleeves are made of glossy plastic, specifically created to protect cards while maintaining their value and appearance. These sleeves feature a clear polypropylene construction that allows collectors to view the cards while preventing dust and handling damage. 

Some premium sleeves use thicker material or additional protective layers. Premium sleeves may include options like UV protection, anti-static properties, or archival-quality materials for long-term preservation. 


###  How do trading card sleeves work?

Trading card sleeves are single-slot protectors that slide onto the back of standard trading cards. Each sleeve creates a barrier between the card and external elements, protecting against scratches, bending, and dust accumulation. 

The clear, durable material also separates the card from hand oils and environmental pollutants, extending the card's longevity without affecting its original appearance.

###  What size cards fit in trading card sleeves?

Standard trading card sleeves accommodate cards measuring 2 1/2 inches by 3 3/8 inches, which fits the vast majority of trading cards produced since the 1960s. This includes baseball cards, football cards, and most other sports and collectible card sets. 

Some newer formats or custom sets might have slightly different dimensions. For these cases, specialized sleeves with reduced or increased slot sizes are available to accommodate the specific card dimensions. 


###  Are trading card sleeves reusable?

Trading card sleeves are designed to be single-use protectors, but with careful handling and proper maintenance, they can be reused multiple times. It's recommended to use fresh sleeves for each new card to maintain optimal protection. 

After each use, thoroughly clean the sleeves with a mild cleaner and allow them to completely air dry before reuse. Proper care can extend their useful lifespan and maintain their protective properties.

###  What should I consider when choosing trading card sleeves?

Select sleeves based on your collection's size and intended use. Basic sleeves are suitable for casual collections, while premium options are recommended for valuable or rare cards requiring additional protection. 

Consider factors like sleeve quality, material durability, and protective features. Options with UV protection, anti-static properties, or archival-quality materials may be worth the investment for long-term preservation. 


###  Can trading card sleeves be recycled?

Standard trading card sleeves are made from polypropylene, which is typically not recyclable through residential recycling programs due to its specialized plastic type. However, many trading card retailers and enthusiasts collect used sleeves for bulk recycling through specialized programs. 

Check with local card shops or online communities for recycling options. Some companies also offer bulk recycling services for their customers, providing convenient disposal methods for used sleeves.
