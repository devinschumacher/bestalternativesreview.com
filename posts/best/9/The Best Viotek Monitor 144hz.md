## Buyer's Guide

The Viotek monitor with 144Hz refresh rate offers an impressive gaming display, but several key factors influence its value and performance. Understanding these aspects helps you make an informed choice. 


### Technical Specifications

144Hz refresh rate delivers smoother motion than standard 60Hz monitors. Look for a response time under 5ms for minimal input lag, and a display panel type like VA or G-Sync Compatible for consistent performance. Consider a resolution of 1080p or higher for clearer visuals.

Pair your Viotek monitor with a graphics card that can maintain 144 FPS at your desired settings. Gaming performance depends on factors like CPU power, memory, and overall system specifications. Ensure your power supply and cooling solutions can handle the additional load. 


### Usage Requirements

144Hz refresh rate is most beneficial for competitive gaming and fast-paced games. For casual gaming or productivity use, a 60Hz monitor might be adequate. Consider your primary use case when evaluating the monitor's capabilities. 


### Installation and Setup

Viotek monitors typically require standard desktop mounting and power connection. Check your graphics card's display outputs (HDMI, DisplayPort) compatibility with the monitor's inputs.
