## FAQ


### What is Great Stuff Pestblock?

Great Stuff Pestblock is a polyurethane-based sealant specifically designed to prevent pest entry into homes and buildings. It forms a long-lasting, flexible barrier that effectively stops common household pests such as mice, ants, and spiders. 

The product comes in various formulations to address different sealing needs, including indoor wall cracks, gaps around windows, and utility openings. It's widely recognized for its effectiveness in pest exclusion and its durability against environmental conditions. 


### How long does it take for Pestblock to dry?

Pestblock usually dries to the touch within 30 minutes, but it's important to wait 24 hours before applying any paint or coating over the sealed areas. Complete cure time for optimal performance is typically 72 hours. 

The drying process is accelerated by proper ventilation and room temperature. Extreme heat or humidity can slow down the drying time, so it's advisable to work in well-ventilated areas with moderate temperatures. 


### Can Pestblock be used indoors and outdoors?

Yes, Pestblock is suitable for both indoor and outdoor applications. It's commonly used to seal gaps in homes, outdoor structures, and around utility penetrations. The product's flexibility makes it ideal for expanding and contracting materials while maintaining its sealant properties. 

For outdoor applications, choose a formulation that's specifically designed for weather exposure to ensure long-term effectiveness against environmental elements. 


### What makes Pestblock different from regular caulk?

While both Pestblock and regular caulk are sealants, Pestblock is formulated with additional properties that make it more effective against pests. It contains specialized chemicals that deter insects and rodents from attempting to chew through or damage the sealant. 

Regular caulk may crack or fail when exposed to repeated pest activity, while Pestblock maintains its integrity even in areas where pests repeatedly attempt entry. This makes it particularly useful for high-traffic pest areas. 


### How do you apply Pestblock?

To apply Pestblock, you'll need a standard caulk gun and the appropriate cartridges. Begin by cleaning the area to be sealed, then apply a consistent bead of Pestblock to the gap or crack. Use a caulk smoothing tool to ensure an even application and proper expansion of the sealant. 

For particularly small or detailed areas, consider using a precision nozzle attachment to direct the caulk flow more accurately. Always read the product instructions for specific application guidance and recommended surface preparation. 


### How do you know if Pestblock needs reapplication?

Pestblock typically requires reapplication every 5-7 years, depending on environmental conditions and pest activity levels. Check the sealed areas regularly for signs of deterioration, such as cracked, peeling, or discolored sealant. 

If you notice gaps, cracks, or areas where pests have succeeded in entering, it's time to reapply Pestblock. Regular maintenance inspections can help catch issues before they become problematic, ensuring lasting protection against pests.
