## Buyer's Guide

Skin care products can vary greatly in their formulations, making it essential to choose the right lube for your sensitive skin type. Understanding key ingredients and properties will help you select a product that provides effective lubrication while minimizing irritation. 


### Key Ingredients to Look For

Product formulas containing gentle emollients like squalane, jojoba oil, or glycerin can help soothe and protect sensitive skin. These natural ingredients form a protective barrier while providing smooth glide during application. Avoid products with harsh chemicals, fragrances, or preservatives that may cause irritation. 


### Formulation Considerations

Water-based lubes are generally the most suitable for sensitive skin, as they clean up easily and have fewer potential allergens than other formulas. Silicone-based products can provide long-lasting lubrication but may be more likely to cause irritation. Choose a formula that matches your specific needs and preferences. 


### Testing and Patch Testing

Before using a new lubricant, perform a patch test on a small, hidden area of skin to check for any adverse reactions. This simple step can help you identify potential irritants and ensure compatibility with your skin type. 


### Storage and Freshness

Proper storage is crucial for maintaining product quality, especially for sensitive skin products. Store lubricants in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat sources. Check expiration dates and avoid using products that show signs of separation or unusual texture changes. 


## FAQ

All products undergo rigorous testing to ensure they're free from harsh chemicals, parabens, and artificial fragrances that can cause skin reactions. 


### How do I determine if a sensitive skin lube is right for me?

Check for products specifically labeled as hypoallergenic or dermatologist-tested. Look for simple ingredient lists without unfamiliar additives.

However, if you experience persistent dryness, consult a healthcare provider to rule out underlying conditions. 


### How long do sensitive skin lubes last?
