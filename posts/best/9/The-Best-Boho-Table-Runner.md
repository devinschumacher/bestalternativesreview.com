## Buyer's Guide

Boho table runners blend earthy colors and natural elements to create a warm, inviting centerpiece for any table. When selecting the right boho table runner, consider several key factors to ensure it enhances both the aesthetics and functionality of your space. 


### Size and Proportion

Select a runner length that complements your table while allowing enough space for napkins and plates. Standard table runner lengths range from 60 to 96 inches, with 72 inches being a popular choice for most table sizes. The width should be generous enough to create visual impact without overwhelming the table. 


### Material and Texture

Boho runners often feature rich, natural materials like cotton, linen, or jute. Consider the texture you prefer - soft, woven cottons offer a cozy feel, while textured jute adds a more rustic element. The material should also match your maintenance needs, with linens being more durable and machine washable compared to delicate cottons. 


### Color and Pattern

Earthy tones like terracotta, olive green, and mustard yellow form the foundation of boho designs. These neutral colors pair well with both natural and synthetic elements. Consider patterns that include tribal prints, floral motifs, or macramé details, as these elements are central to boho aesthetics. 


### Maintenance and Care

Most boho runners require regular care to maintain their texture and color. Opt for materials that resist fading when exposed to sun, and choose washable options for easier maintenance. Natural fibers may require more delicate handling and may show wear over time, so consider this when selecting your runner. 


## FAQ


### What is a boho table runner?

A boho table runner is a decorative textile that extends beyond the standard tablecloth, adding visual interest and texture to your dining or coffee table. It often features handwoven patterns, nature-inspired designs, and vibrant colors typical of Bohemian style. 

These runners can be made from various materials including cotton, linen, wool, or a blend of fibers, with embroidery, fringe, or tassels often incorporated into the design. 


### What sizes are available for boho table runners?

Standard lengths range from 60 to 72 inches, which are suitable for most dining tables. Width typically varies between 10 to 12 inches, but wider options up to 16 inches are available for larger tables or as a feature piece. 

Specialty sizes can accommodate extra-long tables or create an oversized focal point when paired with matching placemats or napkins. 


### How should I care for my boho table runner?

Care requirements vary by material, but most boho runners can be machine washed in cold water on a gentle cycle. It's best to check the care label before washing, especially for runners featuring natural fibers or decorative elements like fringe or tassels. 

Air drying or tumble drying on low heat is recommended to maintain the fabric's shape and prevent shrinkage. For special designs, professional dry cleaning might be advisable to preserve the integrity of the handmade elements. 


### What styles complement boho table runners?

The versatile nature of boho runners means they pair well with various decor styles, from casual country to eclectic urban settings. Their natural colors and earthy tones work particularly well with neutral palettes, while bold patterns can serve as a focal point in mixed-media displays. 

Decorative elements like candles, plants, and woven baskets enhance the boho aesthetic when combined with these runners, creating a cohesive look that embraces both nature and handcrafted elements. 


### How do I measure for a boho table runner?

Measure the length of your table plus the desired overhang on both sides. Most runners extend 6-12 inches beyond the table's edges to create a cascading effect, though longer runners can create a dramatic look. 

Measure the table's width and add 4-6 inches to determine the ideal runner width. This allows the runner to sit properly in the center while providing enough coverage to frame the table effectively. 


### Can I mix and match boho table runners?

Yes, mixing patterns and colors from different boho runners can create an interesting visual dialogue while maintaining consistency. Look for common themes like natural elements or similar color schemes to keep the look cohesive. 

When mixing runners, consider the scale and proportion. Pairing runners with significantly different patterns or sizes can create visual interest, while matching runners maintain a uniform look across the table.
