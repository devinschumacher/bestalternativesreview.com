## Buyer's Guide

Dewalt lights span a range of applications from automotive inspection to industrial work environments. The most suitable Dewalt light for your needs depends on factors including brightness, beam pattern, and portability requirements. 


### Brightness and Illumination

The brightness of a Dewalt light is measured in lumens. For general work tasks, 1,000-2,000 lumens are adequate. Professionals requiring detailed inspection or working in darker environments may need higher lumen output, up to 5,000 lumens or more. 


### Beam Pattern

The beam pattern affects how the light spreads and how far it reaches. Spot beams produce a narrow, intense beam ideal for long-range illumination, while flood beams provide wider coverage with less concentration. Choose based on whether you need pinpoint illumination or broader workspace coverage. 


### Portability and Design Features

Portable Dewalt lights often include features like ergonomic handles, wrist straps, and clip attachments. Consider the weight, material construction, and overall design that best fits your intended use - from stationary workbenches to handheld applications in tight spaces. 


### Battery and Power Options

Dewalt lighting products typically use rechargeable battery packs compatible with their tool ecosystem. Standard options include 2.0A and 3.0A recharge cycles. Consider a light with multiple power modes to balance brightness and runtime for different tasks and environments.
