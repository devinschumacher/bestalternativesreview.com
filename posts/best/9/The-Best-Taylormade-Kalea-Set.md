### Driver and Fairway Woods

These clubs feature adjustable hosels for precise ball flight control, while their forgiveness technology helps players of all skill levels. The clubs' aerodynamic profiles reduce air resistance, improving both distance and accuracy.

The included putter incorporates TaylorMade's Milled Grind technology, which allows for personalized adjustability in face and sole angle. This can help players find their ideal striking setup and improve impact consistency.

## FAQ


### What are the main features of the Taylormade Kalea set?

The Taylormade Kalea set combines TaylorMade's acclaimed aesthetics with their latest technologies for improved performance. Key features include a thin, 0.8mm face design that maximizes ball speed, adjustable hosel settings for precise fit, and a dual-material construction that combines a forged face with a durable crown. 

The set includes two woods (19° driver and 14° fairway wood) and three irons (3-5-7), each designed to optimize distance and accuracy through TaylorMade's advanced Tour Preferred engineering. 


### How does the adjustable hosel affect the Kalea driver's performance?

The adjustable hosel on the Kalea driver allows for changes in face angle and loft at the retail point of sale, giving golfers the ability to fine-tune their ball flight. This customization ensures that each golfer can achieve the optimal setup for their swing characteristics. 

The adjustable hosel works independently of the face angle setting, meaning golfers can experiment with both settings to find their ideal combination for maximum distance and accuracy. 


### What benefits does the dual-material construction provide?

The dual-material construction of the Kalea set combines a forged face with a high-strength crown material. The forged face delivers increased ball speed and reduced forgiveness, while the crown material helps prevent denting during play. 

By strategically placing the lighter crown material above and behind the face, TaylorMade has created a club that's both aerodynamic and durable, with minimal impact on the club's overall weight. 


### How does the thin face design impact the driver's performance?

The 0.8mm face thickness on the Kalea driver is engineered to maximize ball speed by reducing deformation upon impact. This thin face design allows for more consistent energy transfer from club to ball, particularly with off-center hits. 

While the thin face offers potential benefit for tour players and experienced golfers, beginners may notice a decrease in ball flight consistency until they adapt to the different feel and feedback. 


### What makes the Kalea irons' design unique?

The Kalea irons feature a unique "reverse taper" design in the 3-5-7 models, where the sole tapers away from the heel and toe. This design helps prevent the clubs from twisting during aggressive swings while maintaining a low center of gravity for improved launch angles. 

Each iron in the set has a thinner topline and sole design that reduces aerodynamic drag, allowing for faster ball speeds and more consistent distance. 


### Are the TaylorMade Kalea clubs compatible with golf bags and equipment?

The Kalea set's overall dimensions are slightly shorter than traditional TaylorMade clubs, which means they may fit more comfortably in standard golf bags with minimal clearance issues. The driver measures 43.5 inches, while the fairway wood is 40.5 inches. 

The adjustable hosel design and the club's aerodynamic profile help minimize interference with other golf clubs and accessories when storing or transporting the set.
