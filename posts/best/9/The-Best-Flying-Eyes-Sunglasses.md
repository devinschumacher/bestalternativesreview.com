### Lens Technology

### Size and Fit

Frames should fit snugly around the eyes without sliding, with temple pieces wrapping comfortably behind the ears. Proper fit prevents air pressure changes from causing lenses to fog or become dislodged during flight.

### What lens options are available for Flying Eyes sunglasses?

The brand also provides interchangeable lens options for select styles, allowing wearers to switch between different colored or performance lenses based on their specific needs and conditions.

Users with wider bridges may need to adjust their selection based on the specific model's width options, as the double bridge design can vary slightly between styles. The brand recommends trying on different models to find the perfect fit.
