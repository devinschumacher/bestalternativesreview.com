## Buyer's Guide

Baby's first table and chairs set is a milestone worth celebrating, and the Bloom highchair has become a popular choice for its stylish design and practical features. This guide will help you understand the key elements of a quality highchair, from safety standards to comfort options, so you can make an informed decision. 


### Safety Features

Always prioritize safety when selecting a highchair. Look for models with wide bases for stability, 5-point harness systems that secure at the hips and shoulders, and smooth, rounded edges to prevent bumps and bruises. The seat should be free of sharp corners and have ventilation to prevent overheating during meals. 

![Bloom-Highchair-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Bloom-Highchair-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Adjustability and Growth

A good highchair should grow with your baby, offering adjustable seat heights and tray positions. The harness should be securely fastened at a comfortable height, and the seat should recline to a semi-reclined position as your baby grows. The tray needs to extend high enough for older toddlers while remaining secure during meals. 


### Comfort and Support

Pay attention to the padding and materials used in the seat and tray. They should be made from food-grade materials that resist water and bacteria. The seat needs to be firm but comfortable, with adequate space for children up to 65 pounds. The handrails and front rest should be wide enough for support but not too bulky. 

![Bloom-Highchair-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Bloom-Highchair-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Care and Cleaning

Since highchairs come into contact with food and saliva regularly, they need to be easy to clean and maintain. Look for models with wipeable seats and trays, and check if the material can withstand frequent sanitizing. The frame and seat should be dishwasher-safe if possible, reducing the workload during messy meals.
