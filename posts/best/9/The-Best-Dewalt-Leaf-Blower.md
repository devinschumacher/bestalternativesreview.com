## Buyer's Guide

A leaf blower is a versatile lawn care tool that efficiently removes debris from sidewalks, driveways, and lawns. The Dewalt leaf blower category includes both corded and cordless models, each with distinct advantages. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the right blower for your needs. 


### Power Source Options

Consider whether you prefer a corded or cordless blower. Corded models offer consistent power without the need for recharging but require access to an electrical outlet. Cordless blowers provide greater freedom and convenience, thanks to advancements in battery technology, though they have limited runtime between charges. 


### Blower Performance Specifications

Key performance metrics include air velocity (measured in miles per hour) and air volume (measured in cubic feet per minute). Higher air velocity and volume result in more powerful debris removal. For typical residential use, look for a blower with at least 250 cfm (cubic feet per minute) and 300 mph (miles per hour). 


### Blower Design and Features

Handle design affects comfort and control during extended use. Look for models with ergonomic grips and adjustable handles for customizable reach. Some premium models include features like variable speed control, telescoping handles, and built-in lights for evening use. 


### Budget and Product Warranty

Set a budget based on your usage needs and determine if you prioritize portability (for cordless models) or power delivery (for corded models). Additionally, consider the product warranty. A longer warranty period often indicates higher manufacturing standards and better consumer protection. 


## FAQ


### What are the key features of Dewalt leaf blowers?

Dewalt leaf blowers combine powerful performance with user-friendly design elements. The key features include adjustable speed settings for various cleaning tasks, ergonomic grips for comfortable operation, and lightweight construction to reduce user fatigue during extended use. 

Most Dewalt blowers come with adjustable nozzles to concentrate air flow, battery-powered models with interchangeable batteries for extended runtime, and robust build quality for lasting performance. Additionally, many models feature easy-to-clean filters and lightweight, balanced designs optimized for residential use. 


### Which Dewalt leaf blower is the best for residential use?

Between the DCD798RT and DCD799RT, the DCD799RT offers the superior choice for residential use. It delivers 135 mph blast speeds compared to the DCD798RT's 120 mph, making it more effective for clearing thick leaf piles and debris. 

The DCD799RT also features adjustable speed control, a 20% quieter motor, and comes with a dust collector accessory. However, with a slightly higher price point, it's worth considering if the enhanced performance and features justify the cost. 


### Are Dewalt leaf blowers compatible with other Dewalt tools?

Dewalt leaf blowers can be powered by compatible Lithium-Ion batteries, offering increased runtime and convenience. The system requires Dewalt's Lithium-Ion batteries and chargers, with various capacities available to match your usage needs. 

For gasoline-powered models, they use the same engine as other Dewalt generators and mowers, allowing you to maintain your equipment with a single brand. This consistency simplifies maintenance and parts sourcing. 


### How long do Dewalt leaf blower batteries last?

A single fully-charged Lithium-Ion battery in a Dewalt leaf blower typically provides 40-45 minutes of runtime, depending on the model and operating conditions. This duration allows for comprehensive cleaning of medium-sized properties. 

To maximize battery life, it's recommended to avoid completely discharging the battery and to store it at room temperature when not in use. Dewalt's Rapid Charge technology allows you to get up to 60% charge in just 25 minutes, optimizing your workflow. 


### What maintenance is required for Dewalt leaf blowers?

Regular maintenance on a Dewalt leaf blower includes checking air filters for blockages, ensuring all connections are tight, and lubricating moving parts as recommended in the user manual. The air filter should be cleaned or replaced every 25 hours of operation or as needed based on air quality. 

For battery-powered models, keeping the battery charged and stored properly will extend its lifespan. If you're using a gas-powered model, regularly check the fuel mixture, air filter, and spark plug. Both types should have their belt tension checked monthly to maintain optimal performance. 


### Are Dewalt leaf blowers suitable for commercial use?

While Dewalt leaf blowers excel in residential applications, their commercial viability depends on the specific model. The DCD799RT and similar professional models offer the necessary power and features for commercial use, with adjustable speeds and robust construction. 

For heavy-duty commercial applications, consider models with industrial-grade components and higher power outputs. The DCD799XRT, for example, delivers 145 mph blast speed and features durable cast aluminum components designed for professional use.
