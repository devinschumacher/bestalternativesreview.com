## Buyer's Guide

A clocky alarm clock combines traditional timekeeping with the element of surprise to help you wake up on time. These unique devices roll across the room when activated, requiring you to chase them down to silence the alarm. Proper selection ensures you get the right balance of features for your lifestyle and needs. 


### Size and Design Considerations

Clocky designs range from simple geometric shapes to complex mechanical bodies, with sizes typically between 6 to 12 inches. Consider choosing a model that matches your room's decor and available space. The base should be stable to prevent tipping during use. 


### Alarm Features

Standard alarm functions include snooze, multiple alarms, and sleep timers. Some models offer additional features like weather radio, FM radio, or smartphone connectivity. Evaluate which features align with your morning routine and schedule requirements. 


### Power and Durability

Clocky alarms usually run on batteries for portability, though wall-plug models are available. Look for devices with long-lasting batteries or a reliable backup power source. Durability is crucial, as the rolling mechanism can be stressed during use. Choose a model with sturdy construction to withstand daily use. 


### Wake-Up Effectiveness

Effective clocky alarms need a mechanism that prevents immediate rolling, ensuring the initial alarm is heard. The subsequent rolling phase should engage your motor skills to stop the device. Consider models that adjust rolling speed or have different activation methods to suit various sleep phases. 


## FAQ


### What is the primary feature of a Clocky alarm clock?

A Clocky alarm clock is designed to stop you hitting the snooze button by rolling away when your alarm goes off. This practical feature encourages you to get out of bed to turn it off, helping you start your day more alert and productive. 

The alarm clock's movement can be customized to your sleep environment, with speeds and trajectories that can be adjusted to prevent it from rolling into furniture or off ledges. 


### How does the Clocky differ from traditional alarm clocks?

Unlike conventional alarm clocks, Clocky requires physical interaction to turn off. When it rolls away, you must chase after it and locate it to silence the alarm, fostering a more energetic start to your day. 

The lack of snooze buttons forces you to actively engage with the clock, which can help break the snooze habit and improve your morning routine. 


### What materials is the Clocky made from?

Clocky is constructed from durable ABS plastic, which provides a balance of strength and flexibility. The wheel mechanism is made from metal to ensure smooth, consistent movement. 

The base is designed to grip most surfaces while allowing the clock to roll freely across carpet or hard flooring. 


### Is the Clocky suitable for children?

While the basic concept of chasing a rolling clock can be entertaining for children, it's recommended for older kids who can understand the importance of waking up on time. The clock's size and weight make it more suitable for children aged 6 and up. 

Parents should supervise initial use to ensure proper technique and to help establish a consistent morning routine. 


### How long does the Clocky's battery last?

The Clocky runs on four AAA batteries, providing between 2-3 months of continuous use depending on how often you wake to the alarm. 

When the battery power drops, the clock's movement becomes slower, which serves as a visual indicator to replace the batteries promptly. 


### Is the Clocky compatible with different mattress types?

The Clocky's design works with most mattress types, including memory foam, air beds, and futons. The clock's underside features non-slip material that grips the mattress surface, allowing it to roll smoothly while remaining in place when not in use. 

If your mattress is particularly slippery, consider placing a small towel underneath the Clocky for added stability.
