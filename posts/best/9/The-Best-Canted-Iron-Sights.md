## Buyer's Guide

Canted iron sights enhance shooting accuracy for firearms with high-mounted optics. They help align the sights properly with the eye, reducing the need for head and eye movement during aiming. 


### Magnification Compatibility

Check the sights' mounting height compatibility with your scope's magnification. Sights may need to be higher for longer scopes. Ensure proper sight alignment regardless of scope zoom level.

### Sight Material and Construction

Most canted iron sights are made from hardened steel or durable plastic. Steel provides better accuracy but is heavier. Plastic options are lighter but may wear over time. Consider the balance between weight and durability based on your shooting preference. 


### Mounting System

Standard mounting systems include MOAAA, Picatinny rail, and proprietary designs. MOAAA and Picatinny rails are compatible with most firearm models. Proprietary systems may offer better compatibility with specific manufacturers' products.

### Adjustability

Look for sights with adjustable cant angles to fine-tune your sight picture. The adjustable range typically varies from 5 to 15 degrees. Consider sights with smaller adjustment increments for more precise tuning. 


## FAQ

![Canted-Iron-Sights-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Canted-Iron-Sights-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are canted iron sights?

Canted iron sights feature the rear sight post tilted upward and to the shooter's strong side. This design compensates for natural bullet drop and wind drift at longer ranges, improving accuracy for shooters with limited sight radius. 

The forward slope of the rear sight and its placement at a specific angle are crucial for effective canted iron sights. This geometry helps align the sights correctly when the shooter's eye is offset from the traditional eye-to-sight alignment. 


### How do canted iron sights improve accuracy?

Canted iron sights reduce the effects of bullet drop and wind drift by positioning the front sight over a point aimed at the target. This aligns the shooter's natural point of impact with the intended target location, compensating for the bullet's trajectory and environmental factors. 

The design works best with proper sight alignment and practice. The forward slope of the rear sight allows the shooter to maintain a natural aiming position while the canted sight aligns with the target. 

![Canted-Iron-Sights-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Canted-Iron-Sights-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Are canted iron sights suitable for all types of shooting?

While canted iron sights excel for long-range shooting and scenarios with limited sight radius, they may not be the best choice for close-range work or rapid-fire applications. The unique sight alignment requires practice to develop proper technique. 

These sights are particularly effective for sporting applications like silhouette shooting, where precise long-range shots are common, and target identification demands a clear sight picture. 


### What is the optimal angle for canted iron sights?

The standard canted iron sight angle is 1Â°, though some shooters may prefer 1.5Â° or 2Â° depending on their shooting distance and preference. The angle can be adjusted during installation to find the optimal balance between compensation and ease of use. 

The forward slope of the rear sight typically ranges from 0.100" to 0.125" over a 12" sight radius. This geometry ensures proper sight alignment while maintaining a natural shooting position. 

![Canted-Iron-Sights-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Canted-Iron-Sights-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can canted iron sights be used with optics?

While canted iron sights are specifically designed for use without optics, their principle of compensating for bullet drop and wind drift can be applied to optic-based systems through careful zeroing. This approach requires precise measurement and adjustment to maintain proper sight alignment. 

Using canted iron sights with optics is less common due to the complex interaction between the sight's geometry and the scope's characteristics. Traditional iron sights remain the primary choice when optics are present. 


### How do canted iron sights affect recoil management?

The canted sight design can actually improve recoil management by maintaining proper sight alignment during a more natural shooting posture. This is particularly beneficial in powerful calibers where maintaining a stable sight picture through recoil can be challenging with traditional sights. 

However, the forward slope of the rear sight and its slightly elevated position may increase felt recoil slightly by changing the shooting position's stability. Proper fundamentals and practice remain crucial for managing recoil effectively.
