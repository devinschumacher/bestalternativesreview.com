## FAQ


### What is an expanding file folder?

Expanding file folders feature accordion-style pages that allow you to increase the storage capacity of the folder without adding additional pieces. The pages typically contain pockets or slots for documents and can be customized with labels and dividers for organization. 

The primary advantage of expanding file folders is their ability to hold a large volume of papers in a single, easily portable unit. They're commonly used in offices, schools, and home offices for managing files and documents. 


### How do expanding file folders work?

Each page of an expanding file folder slides into grooves along the sides, creating multiple compartments. The pages can be added or removed as needed to adjust the folder's size and capacity. 

Most varieties include pockets, slots, or file tabs for organizing documents. The pages are typically made from durable material that resists folding and can support printed or photocopied sheets. 


### What materials are expanding file folders made from?

These folders are available in several materials, including paperboard, plastic, and PVC-coated paper. The most common type uses heavy-duty paperboard that can support up to 50 pounds of documents per page. 

PVC-coated options provide superior water resistance and durability but may be less environmentally friendly. Plastic folders are typically clear or translucent, allowing you to view the contents without opening the folder. 


### What sizes are available for expanding file folders?

Standard sizes range from 12 to 24 inches in length, with each expanding page adding 1.5 to 2 inches to the folder's length. Width typically ranges from 7 to 10 inches, with some ultra-wide options available. 

Depth usually measures between 1.5 and 2.5 inches, providing sufficient space for pockets and documents. Some manufacturers offer specialized sizes for specific applications, such as legal or letter paper storage. 


### What types of documents work best in expanding file folders?

The best documents for expanding file folders include printed materials, reports, contracts, and other paper-based files that need organizing. The folders excel with items that require regular review or easy access. 

For best results, use standard paper sizes like letter or A4 with standard margins. Avoid excessive folding, heavy staples, or bulky items that could damage the folder's mechanism or compress the pages. 


### How do I maintain expanding file folders?

Regular maintenance includes straightening the pages, checking for misalignment, and ensuring all pockets and slots are functioning properly. Avoid using excessive force when adding or removing pages to prevent binding. 

Store folders flat or upright to prevent unnecessary stress on the pages. Consider using protective covers or boxes to shield the folders from dust and damage, especially in shared office environments.
