## Buyer's Guide

The Crkt Pilar is a versatile outdoor furniture piece that combines style and functionality. Understanding its key features will help you select the right size and configuration for your space. 


### Size and Scale

Crkt Pilars come in various dimensions, so measuring your intended installation site is crucial. Consider the height (typically between 6-8 feet), width (usually 2-3 feet), and depth (approximately 2-4 feet) to ensure proper sizing. Factor in additional space for seating and any decorative elements you plan to add. 


### Configuration Options

These pillars often offer multiple configuration possibilities, including freestanding, paired, or clustered setups. Evaluate how you plan to use the space surrounding the pillar – nearby seating, walkways, or landscaping – to determine the most practical configuration for your needs. 


### Maintenance Requirements

Outdoor furniture exposed to weather needs regular maintenance. Look for materials that resist fading, warping, and moisture damage. Consider how easily you can clean and maintain the pillar, as this will affect its longevity and appearance over time. 


### Proximity to Other Elements

Avoid positioning Crkt Pilars too close to buildings or other structures, as this can reduce airflow and potentially damage the foundation. Similarly, ensure there's enough space between multiple pillars for comfortable movement and access. The surrounding landscaping should complement rather than compete with the pillar's design and scale.
