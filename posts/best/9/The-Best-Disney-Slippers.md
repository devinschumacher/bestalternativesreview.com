Properly fitting Disney slippers should allow for about a thumb's width of space between your longest toe and the end of the shoe. The heel should sit snugly without feeling too tight, and the arch should fit comfortably without bunching or twisting the material. 

If you're ordering online, try to select a style with adjustable features like Velcro straps or elastic sides to ensure a secure fit. Always measure your feet against the manufacturer's size chart to determine the correct fit. 


### What sizes do Disney slippers come in?
