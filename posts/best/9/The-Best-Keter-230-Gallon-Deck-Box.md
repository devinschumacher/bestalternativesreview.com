## Buyer's Guide

A 230-gallon deck box from Keter is designed for outdoor storage of garden tools, equipment, and outdoor items. This guide outlines key features and considerations to help you select the right deck box for your needs. 


### Size and Capacity

Look for a box with generous dimensions to maximize storage space. The 230-gallon capacity should comfortably accommodate gardening tools, power equipment, and seasonal items. Consider the box's footprint and ensure it fits within your designated storage area on the deck. 


### Material Quality

High-density polyethylene (HDPE) construction provides the most durable option for outdoor storage. HDPE resists cracking, warping, and UV damage. Premium models may offer thicker walls or reinforced corners for added durability. 


### Drainage and Waterproofing

Choose a model with built-in drainage channels to prevent water accumulation and potential warping. Look for a box that seals tightly with its lid to protect stored items from moisture, dust, and pests. Some models feature airtight gaskets or double lids for superior waterproofing. 


### Additional Features

Consider adding wheels or casters for easy movement, especially if you need to move the box between storage locations. Some models offer extra compartments or shelving to organize different types of items. Look for a box with UV protection to maintain the finish and prevent discoloration over time. 


## FAQ


### What materials is the Keter 230 Gallon Deck Box made from?

The deck box features durable HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) construction, providing excellent resistance to corrosion and UV damage. The material can withstand various weather conditions and external elements. 

The box includes a sealed lid with pressure-fit door panels that create a tight seal, preventing water leakage and maintaining an airtight storage environment. The lid also doubles as a seat for added convenience. 


### How much weight can the Keter 230 Gallon Deck Box support?

The deck box is designed to support up to 600 pounds when placed flat on its lid, making it suitable for storing heavy items. The box itself weighs approximately 62 pounds, so the total supported load is 662 pounds. 

For maximum stability, it's recommended to place items towards the center of the box rather than at the corners, as this distributes weight more evenly and reduces the risk of tipping. 


### What are the interior dimensions of the Keter 230 Gallon Deck Box?

The interior measurements are 61.5 inches long x 20.5 inches wide x 28 inches high, providing a generous 230-gallon storage capacity. This allows for multiple organization options and fitting of large items. 

The box design includes two internal compartments separated by a reinforced divider, which helps keep contents organized while maintaining the overall capacity. 


### Can the Keter 230 Gallon Deck Box be placed on uneven surfaces?

The box includes rubber feet at each corner that help level it on uneven surfaces, but for optimal performance and weight distribution, it's best used on flat ground. The feet also provide a stable base when the box is placed on its side or end. 

When storing heavy items, especially when partially filled, try to keep the box aligned with the longest side facing down to maintain stability and prevent tipping. 


### What additional features does the Keter 230 Gallon Deck Box offer?

In addition to the weather-resistant materials and reinforced construction, the box features built-in tie-down loops on the lid and sides, which help secure items inside and prevent movement during transport. The box also includes storage pockets on the side panels for small accessories or tools. 

The deck box comes with a limited lifetime warranty, indicating the manufacturer's confidence in the product's durability. It's backed by a warranty that covers defects in materials and workmanship under normal use. 


### How do I maintain the Keter 230 Gallon Deck Box?

To maintain its integrity, clean the box with mild soap and water when needed, avoiding harsh chemicals that could damage the HDPE material. Allow it to dry completely before storing items inside. 

Check the rubber feet periodically for wear and replace them if necessary to ensure proper leveling. For storage, keep the box in a dry area and avoid excessive exposure to direct sunlight.
