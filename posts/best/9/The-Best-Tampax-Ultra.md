## Buyer's Guide

Understanding the key features and considerations for Tampax Ultra products can help you make an informed choice that suits your menstrual cycle and personal preferences. Here's what to look for when selecting the right Tampax Ultra product for you. 


### Size and Absorbency

Ultras come in three absorbency levels: Light, Regular, and Super. Consider your typical flow and leakage concerns to determine the appropriate level.

### Protection and Security Features

Look for products with Stay-Zone technology, which helps keep the tampon in place. Wings and shields provide additional security. Some users prefer slim-fit designs for discretion, while others need wider wings for stability during physical activities. 


### Comfort and Sensitivity

The Ultra range includes options for sensitive skin. Check for hypoallergenic materials and fragrance-free formulas. The texture and shape of the tampon can affect comfort, so try different styles to find what works best for you.

### Environmental and Storage Considerations

Ultras are available in both cardboard and plastic packaging. Opt for cardboard for better environmental impact. Store tampons in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Keep a backup pack at work, school, or in your car for unexpected changes in your schedule. 


## FAQ

### What is Tampax Ultra?

Tampax Ultra is a highly absorbent tampon designed for women who experience heavy menstrual flow. It offers 12-hour protection and a flexible, slim core that moves with the body's natural movement. 

Unlike regular tampons, Ultras are available in three different absorbency levels - Light (9.2g), Medium (11g), and Heavy (13g) - to match individual flow patterns. 


### How do Ultra tampons work?

Ultra tampons feature a flexible core that expands to fit the vaginal canal, providing secure absorption of menstrual blood. The wings lock in place for stability during physical activity. 

Each tampon is individually wrapped in a protective foil packet and requires proper disposal after use. The average usage frequency is 4-6 tampons per cycle, depending on flow intensity. 

![Tampax-Ultra-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Tampax-Ultra-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Are Ultra tampons safe for daily use?

Yes, when used according to the manufacturer's instructions, Tampax Ultra tampons are safe for daily use during menstruation. Always perform a tampon check every 4-6 hours to maintain hygiene and prevent prolapse. 

If you experience any discomfort, unusual symptoms, or suspect leakage, remove the tampon and consult a healthcare provider. The maximum continuous use time is 8 hours per tampon. 


### How should I dispose of Ultra tampons?

Tampax Ultra tampons should be wrapped in the protective foil before disposal. They are designed for single-use and should not be flushed down the toilet or thrown in the regular trash.

Teenagers under 12 years of age and women who are pregnant should not use tampons unless specifically instructed by a healthcare provider. Always follow age-restricted guidelines. 


### Can I sleep with an Ultra tampon in?

It is generally safe to sleep with a Tampax Ultra tampon in place, provided you have chosen the appropriate absorbency level for your flow. The maximum recommended continuous use time is 8 hours per tampon. 

Perform a tampon check before bed to ensure proper placement and comfort. If you experience any leakage or discomfort during the night, consider changing the tampon before going to sleep.
