## Buyer's Guide

90 degrees leggings combine performance fabrics with strategic compression for athletic wear that moves with you. These versatile pieces offer several key features and benefits that impact their comfort and functionality during exercise. 


### Technical Construction

High-quality 90 degree leggings typically use moisture-wicking materials that draw sweat away from the skin to keep you dry. They employ a four-way stretch construction that allows freedom of movement in all directions. The leg openings usually feature a flatlock seam design to prevent chafing during movement. 


### Compression and Support

Graduated compression helps improve blood flow and reduce muscle fatigue during workouts. The compression level ranges from light to firm, with medium compression being most common for general fitness activities. Look for legging models that maintain consistent pressure throughout the length of the garment. 


### Mobility and Fit

Proper fit is crucial for performance and comfort. The leggings should feel secure but not constricting. Most manufacturers size the legs slightly longer than the torso to prevent bunching during athletic movements. Consider trying on multiple styles to find the best balance of compression and freedom of movement. 


### Washing and Care

These garments require special care to maintain their performance properties. Machine wash them in cold water with similar colors to prevent fading. Use mild detergent and avoid bleach or fabric softeners, as they can damage the elastic fibers. Most 90 degree leggings need to be air-dried rather than put in the dryer. 


## FAQ


### What makes 90 Degrees Leggings unique?

90 Degrees Leggings stand out in the market with their blend of technical fabrics and modern designs. They prioritize moisture-wicking, quick-dry properties, and four-way stretch for enhanced mobility. 

The leggings feature thoughtfully placed pockets, reflective elements for visibility, and a high waistband with stay-up technology to keep them in place during intense workouts. 


### What are the core materials used in these leggings?

These leggings typically combine polyamide and elastane (spandex) for their primary construction. The polyamide provides durability and shape retention, while the elastane offers stretch and recovery. 

Secondary materials may include moisture-wicking fabrics and thermal inserts for temperature regulation, depending on the specific model's intended use. 


### Do 90 Degrees Leggings run true to size?

Most 90 Degrees Leggings run slightly small, particularly through the hip and thigh areas. It's advisable to compare the sizing chart with your own measurements or consider ordering a size up. 

The compression fit and moisture-wicking properties make them best suited for athletic activities, with the slimming effect providing a form-fitting look. 


### How should I care for my 90 Degrees Leggings?

Machine wash these leggings using cold water and a mild detergent to maintain the elasticity and prevent color fading. Avoid using bleach or fabric softeners as they can damage the performance fabrics. 

Avoid drying them in direct sunlight or using a dryer, as this can affect the stretch and shape. Instead, air dry them flat to maintain their integrity. 


### How long do 90 Degrees Leggings typically last?

With regular care, 90 Degrees Leggings can last 6-12 months with daily use, depending on their specific construction and how they're worn. The lifespan can vary based on factors like frequency of use and environmental conditions. 

The elastic components typically maintain their stretch for 2-3 years, but the fabric may show signs of wear and tear over time, particularly around the waistband and seams. 


### What sizes are available for 90 Degrees Leggings?

These leggings usually come in standard women's sizes ranging from XS to 3X, with some variations offering plus sizes up to 4X. Men's sizes typically range from S to 3XL. 

Some styles may offer extended sizing options, while others might have limited availability in larger sizes. It's recommended to check the specific product page for sizing details.
