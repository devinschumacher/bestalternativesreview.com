### Maintenance Requirements

The care of pumpkin pillows depends on their materials. Some are made from washable canvas or polyester, making them easy to maintain by washing the cover when needed. Others incorporate natural materials like wood or straw, which require minimal cleaning and simply benefit from periodic dusting. Check the care instructions for specific maintenance requirements. 


### Design Variations

Consider the placement in relation to windows and lighting, as natural daytime light can enhance the carved details. Avoid direct sunlight, which can fade the colors and damage the materials over time.
