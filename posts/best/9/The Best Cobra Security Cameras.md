## Buyer's Guide

Cobra security cameras offer versatile surveillance solutions for both indoor and outdoor environments. When selecting a camera, consider several key features to ensure you choose the right device for your security needs. 


### Video Resolution and Clarity

The camera's video resolution determines the clarity and detail of the footage. Common resolutions include 720p, 1080p, and 4K, with higher resolutions typically providing clearer images. 

For outdoor cameras, look for models with improved low-light performance, such as those featuring IR night vision or larger sensors that capture better quality in dim conditions.

### Camera Range and Coverage

Indoor cameras usually provide a 180-degree field of view, while outdoor models often offer wider angles for better coverage of larger areas. Consider the camera's maximum range, measured in feet or meters, to ensure it can effectively monitor your desired space. 

For outdoor installations, check the camera's weather resistance ratings (IP66 or higher) and verify that the power source is suitable for your environment. 


### Audio Features and Privacy Settings

Audio capabilities can be crucial for two-way communication or environmental sound monitoring. Evaluate the camera's microphone quality and recording options, including whether it supports local audio storage. 

Privacy features like motion detection and recording triggers help control data storage and reduce unnecessary footage. Consider cameras with adjustable motion sensitivity and privacy zones to protect sensitive areas.

### Network and Connectivity Options

Modern Cobra cameras often support both wired and wireless connectivity, allowing installation flexibility. Wired cameras typically offer more stable connections but require electrical outlets. 

Wireless cameras use either 2.4GHz or 5GHz Wi-Fi, with 5GHz offering less interference but potentially shorter range. Consider cameras with reliable connection protocols and strong signal strength indicators.
