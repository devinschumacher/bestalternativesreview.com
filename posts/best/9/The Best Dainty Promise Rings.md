### What are the typical stone types used in dainty promise rings?

The most common stone in these rings is the solitaire diamond, offering a classic and elegant look. Other popular options include moissanite, lab-grown diamonds, and colored gemstones like blue sapphire or ruby, which can range from smaller sizes to create a subtle sparkle to larger stones for a more noticeable centerpiece.

### How should dainty promise rings be cleaned and maintained?

These rings require minimal maintenance. The best practice is to clean them weekly with mild soap and warm water, or use a specialized jewelry cleaner. Avoid harsh chemicals and ultrasonic cleaners, as they can damage the stones and the metal.

### What occasions are dainty promise rings suitable for?

They are particularly meaningful as friendship rings, engagement promises, or small anniversary gifts, offering a personalized touch without the commitment of a traditional engagement ring. 


### How should you choose the right size and width for a dainty promise ring?

When selecting a dainty promise ring, consider the width of the band and the style of the setting. The ring should fit comfortably on your ring finger, allowing about a quarter-inch of space between the knuckle and the top of the ring. 

Most dainty rings range between 2-4 millimeters in width. Thinner bands are more delicate and suitable for everyday wear, while wider bands can make a more statement piece without overwhelming the finger.
