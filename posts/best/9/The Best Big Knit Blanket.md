## Buyer's Guide

A big knit blanket can transform your living space with its warmth and texture, but not all blankets are created equal. Understanding the key features will help you find a blanket that matches your needs and style. 


### Size and Dimensions

Standard king-sized blankets measure 80 inches by 90 inches, while queen-sized options are 80 inches by 90 inches. Consider your specific size needs, especially if you prefer extra coverage or like to drape multiple blankets together. 


### Materials and Quality

High-quality knits use premium materials like merino wool or cashmere blends that resist pilling and retain their shape well. Cheaper options may use acrylic or lower-quality wool that pills easily and loses its shape over time. 


### Construction and Durability

Look for blankets with tightly woven edges and reinforced corners. The stitching should be clean and straight. Avoid blankets with loose loops or uneven stitches, as these can unravel easily. 


### Care Requirements

Knit blankets that retain their shape and resist pilling tend to hold up better over time. Check the care label for information about washing and drying instructions. Avoid blankets that need frequent special treatments or have restrictive care requirements. 


## FAQ


### What makes a big knit blanket different from regular blankets?

A big knit blanket, often measuring 60 inches by 80 inches or larger, combines generous sizing with the warmth and texture of knitted construction. Unlike regular blankets, which may be thinner or smaller, these oversized throws offer ample coverage and a soft, huggably textured surface. 

These blankets are particularly suitable for adding warmth and texture to living spaces, providing extra comfort during cooler months, or serving as a stylish centerpiece on a couch or bed. 


### How do I choose the right size big knit blanket?

Selecting the right size depends on how you plan to use the blanket. For casual use as a throw, a 60" by 80" size is ideal for most couches. Bigger or smaller options work better for specific needs: larger sizes for beds or multiple-seater couches, and smaller sizes for occasional use or as a picnic blanket. 

Consider the blanket's intended use: extra-large sizes for floor heaters or wall mounts, standard sizes for normal use, or wall-mounted sizes for decorative purposes. 


### What is the best material for a big knit blanket?

The ideal material depends on your specific needs. Wool blends provide excellent warmth and durability but can be heavy. Cotton blends are lighter and more breathable, ideal for spring and fall. Fleece alternatives offer softness and warmth without the weight of wool. 

For outdoor use, water-resistant materials like polyester work best. For indoor use, consider natural fibers like cotton for ventilation and warmth retention. 


### How should I care for my big knit blanket?

Most big knit blankets can be machine washed in cold water on a gentle cycle. Always check the care label first. Wool blankets may need hand washing or gentle wool detergent, while cotton and fleece alternatives can typically handle normal washing. 

Air drying is recommended to maintain the blanket's shape and texture. Direct sunlight should be avoided during drying as it can damage fabrics and fade colors. 


### Are big knit blankets suitable for all seasons?

These blankets excel during cooler months when additional warmth is needed. Wool and blend options provide excellent insulation, making them ideal for cold weather. Heavier materials are perfect for keeping warm near heaters or in drafty rooms. 

Cotton and lighter blends work well for spring and fall, providing warmth without overheating. For summer, consider lightweight alternatives like cotton or bamboo blends for outdoor use. 


### Can big knit blankets be used as outdoor furniture covers?

Many big knit blankets, especially those made from water-resistant materials like polyester or water-repellent cotton blends, are suitable for outdoor use. They protect furniture from the elements while maintaining warmth and texture. 

For outdoor use, prioritize materials that resist water damage and fade from sunlight. Avoid using heavy wool blankets outdoors as they may collect moisture and require frequent washing.
