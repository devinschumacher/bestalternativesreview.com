## FAQ

![Retainer-Brite-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Retainer-Brite-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is Retainer Brite?

Retainer Brite is a dental cleaning solution specifically designed for use with orthodontic retainers. Its formula safely removes surface stains and plaque while maintaining the integrity of the retainer material. 

Unlike harsh abrasives, Retainer Brite uses a mild formula that can be used daily without causing damage to aligners or wire retainers. This makes it a convenient addition to daily oral hygiene routines. 


### How does Retainer Brite work?

When applied according to the instructions, Retainer Brite initiates a chemical reaction that breaks down organic compounds on the surface of your retainer. This process effectively removes stains and plaque without the need for physical scrubbing that could damage your appliance. 

The solution contains fluoride to help strengthen enamel and prevent future buildup. Its mild nature makes it safe to use with both clear aligners and traditional wire retainers. 

![Retainer-Brite-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Retainer-Brite-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Is Retainer Brite safe for all types of retainers?

Yes, Retainer Brite is suitable for all types of orthodontic retainers, including Hawley retainers, clear aligners, and wire retainers. The product is specifically formulated to be gentle on the materials commonly used in these appliances. 

However, always refer to your orthodontist's recommendations and follow the product instructions carefully to ensure proper use and maintenance of your specific retainer type. 


### How often can I use Retainer Brite?

Retainer Brite can be used daily as part of your regular retainer cleaning routine. The daily use formula ensures consistent cleanliness while preventing over-etching or damage to your retainers. 

If your retainers show particularly stubborn stains or buildup, you may use Retainer Brite more frequently, but no more than once per day unless directed otherwise by your orthodontist. 

![Retainer-Brite-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Retainer-Brite-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What results can I expect from using Retainer Brite?

Regular use of Retainer Brite will help maintain clear, stain-free retainers, making them more cosmetically appealing while also improving overall oral hygiene. The solution is particularly effective at removing tea, coffee, and food stains from clear aligners and wire retainers. 

You should notice an improvement in the appearance of your retainers within the first week of regular use. Continued use will help maintain their brilliance and prevent future buildup. 


### How should I use Retainer Brite?

Always wear your retainer while using Retainer Brite. Place your retainer in a small cup containing a small amount of the solution. Let it sit for 3-5 minutes before rinsing thoroughly under running water. 

For best results, use Retainer Brite with a soft-bristled brush to gently agitate the solution around your retainer. Avoid harsh scrubbing as it may damage your appliance. Follow with a final rinse and air dry your retainer.
