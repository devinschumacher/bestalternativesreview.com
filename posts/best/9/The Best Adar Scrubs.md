## FAQ

![Adar-Scrubs-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Adar-Scrubs-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are Adar Scrubs?

Adar Scrubs are specialized skin care products that combine exfoliants with moisturizers to remove dead skin cells and improve skin texture. These scrubs typically contain gentle yet effective exfoliants like alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs), beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs), or mild physical exfoliants such as natural grains or enzymes. 

The products come in various forms, including facial scrubs, body scrubs, and specialized treatments for specific skin concerns like hyperpigmentation or acne. They are designed for regular use as part of a skin care regimen to maintain skin health and appearance. 


### What makes Adar Scrubs different from regular body scrubs?

Adar Scrubs are formulated with specific ingredients and concentrations that are more suitable for regular use in a skin care routine. While regular body scrubs may contain harsher exfoliants or chemicals, Adar Scrubs balance exfoliation with moisturization to prevent dryness and irritation. 

The products often include advanced antioxidants, hyaluronic acid, or other skin-benefiting ingredients that provide additional nourishment during the exfoliation process.

### How often can I use Adar Scrubs?

Most Adar Scrubs are designed for weekly use, though the frequency may vary based on product formulation and skin type. For sensitive skin or specific conditions like eczema, use may be recommended less frequently, such as every 10-14 days. 

Always follow the manufacturer's instructions, as some products may recommend daily use for certain areas or combinations with other treatments. 


### What are the benefits of using Adar Scrubs?

Regular use of Adar Scrubs can improve skin texture, reduce the appearance of fine lines, and help even out skin tone. The combination of exfoliation and moisturization helps remove dead skin cells, unclog pores, and increase skin cell turnover. 

Many users report improved overall skin health, reduced dullness, and a radiant complexion after incorporating Adar Scrubs into their skincare routine. 

![Adar-Scrubs-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Adar-Scrubs-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Are Adar Scrubs suitable for all skin types?

While Adar Scrubs are formulated to be gentle, they may not suit every skin type. Those with very sensitive skin, eczema, or recent skin damage should use caution or avoid physical scrubs altogether. 

People with normal to combination skin types typically tolerate Adar Scrubs well, while those with dry or mature skin may benefit from products with more hydrating properties. 


### How should I use Adar Scrubs?

Start by applying a small amount of the scrub to damp skin in circular motions, focusing on congested areas or rough patches. Avoid the eye area and sensitive areas like the lips. 

After massaging the product into the skin, rinse thoroughly with warm water and follow with a moisturizer to lock in hydration.
