## Buyer's Guide

Reolink security cameras offer a blend of affordability and functionality, making them a popular choice for residential and small business security systems. Understanding their key features and requirements will help you select the right camera for your needs. 


### Video Quality and Resolution

Video quality is crucial for clear surveillance. Reolink cameras typically offer resolutions between 1080p and 4K, which determines how detailed the footage is. Consider your viewing distance and storage space when choosing a resolution. Higher resolutions capture more detail but require more storage and bandwidth. 


### Power and Installation Options

Camera power sources and installation locations affect their reliability and visibility. Reolink offers both PoE (Power over Ethernet) and 24V AC models. PoE cameras are generally easier to install as they don't require additional power outlets. Consider your home's wiring and power availability when selecting a power source. 


### Weatherproofing and Outdoor Use

Outdoor cameras need robust weatherproofing to withstand varying conditions. Look for cameras with IP66 or higher ratings, which protect against dust and water. Consider factors like temperature range, sunlight exposure, and local weather patterns to choose the right outdoor camera model. 


### Storage and Connectivity

Storage options and connectivity determine how you view and access your footage. Reolink cameras support local storage via SD cards and cloud storage through their app. Consider your preferred viewing method (local app, web portal, or NVR) and the amount of storage needed for your monitoring period.
