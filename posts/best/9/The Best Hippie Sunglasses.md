### Sun Protection Features

Look for UV400 protection across the entire lens surface, blocking 100% of UV-A and UV-B rays. Polarized lenses reduce glare from water and reflective surfaces, while anti-reflective coating helps with night vision and indoor lighting conditions. 


### Frame Durability and Fit

Check for reinforced nose pads and temples to ensure the glasses stay in place during outdoor activities. The temples should angle downward slightly to prevent slipping, and the ear loops should sit comfortably behind the ears without causing pressure points.
