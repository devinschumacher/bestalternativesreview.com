### Choosing the Right Fit

Satin-backed sequin blouses move with your body, while rigid frames maintain their shape but may feel less comfortable during movement. Consider your silhouette preference and intended use when selecting between these styles. 


### Selecting Suitable Fabrics

Besides sequins, some blouses feature satin or silk blends for smoothness and sheen. Opt for moisture-wicking materials if you plan to wear them under jackets or in formal settings that require layering.
