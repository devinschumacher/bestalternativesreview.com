## Buyer's Guide

The Remington RP9 holster is a popular choice for both new and experienced gun owners. This guide will help you understand the key features and considerations when selecting a holster that matches your needs and lifestyle. 


### Material and Construction

Most RP9 holsters are made from polymer or leather. Polymer holsters offer lightweight, durable options that can be easily concealed under clothing. Leather holsters provide a natural grip and improve with age as they break in, but they're heavier and less adaptable to different clothing types.

### Retention Features

Look for holsters with secure retention mechanisms, especially if you carry in public or have situational awareness concerns. Positive retention can prevent accidental discharge during holster removal or while carrying in pockets, ensuring your firearm remains secure. 


### Concealment Options

The holster's profile and design play a crucial role in concealment. Thin-profile holsters reduce bulge under clothing, while magazine carriers or double-stack holsters might be more suitable for concealed carry. Consider the holster's height - some models are taller for additional retention while others are shorter for lower-profile carry.

### Maintenance and Cleaning

Proper maintenance extends holster life and ensures reliable performance. For polymer holsters, regular cleaning prevents scratches and damage. Leather holsters require conditioning to maintain suppleness and prevent cracking. Both types should be cleaned after firearm use to remove residue and prevent corrosion.
