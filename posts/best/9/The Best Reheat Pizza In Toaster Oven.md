## Buyer's Guide

Toaster ovens offer a practical solution for reheating pizza, combining convenience with energy efficiency. Understanding their capabilities and limitations will help you select the right model for your needs. 


### Cooking Capacity

Toaster ovens vary in size, measured in interior dimensions or advertised cooking capacities. Common sizes range from 1.3 to 3.9 cubic feet. Consider the typical pizza sizes you'll be reheating: small toaster ovens handle individual slices, while larger models accommodate whole pies or multiple slices at once.

### Heating Elements and Distribution

Most toaster ovens feature top and bottom heating elements that distribute heat effectively. Look for models with adjustable racks to position the pizza at the optimal height for even baking. Some advanced models include convection features, which can help crisp the pizza crust and melt the cheese more efficiently. 


### Temperature Control and Settings

Reheat settings can simplify the process, but adjustable temperature control provides more flexibility. The temperature range typically spans 150 to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. For optimal results, start with the recommended setting or temperature for your pizza type and adjust based on desired crispness and meltpoint.

### Convenience Features

Small details can enhance the reheating experience. Features like easy-clean interiors, non-stick interiors, or grease collection trays reduce cleanup. The presence of crisper controls allows you to maintain the pizza's texture. Timer functions ensure you don't overcook the reheated pizza. 


## FAQ

![Reheat-Pizza-In-Toaster-Oven-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Reheat-Pizza-In-Toaster-Oven-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a toaster oven?

A toaster oven is a kitchen appliance that combines the functions of a conventional oven and a toaster. It is smaller than a full-size oven but offers similar capabilities for baking, broiling, and reheating food. 

Most toaster ovens measure between 12-18 inches in width and come with multiple settings for different cooking tasks. They are ideal for reheating small to medium-sized pizzas quickly and conveniently. 


### How do I reheat pizza in a toaster oven?

Preheat your toaster oven to 350°F (175°C). Place the pizza on a baking sheet or pizza stone to prevent it from directly touching the oven walls. Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the edges are hot. 

For faster reheating, use the broil function with the pizza positioned near the top of the oven. Keep an eye on it to prevent burning, and monitor for complete heating throughout. 

![Reheat-Pizza-In-Toaster-Oven-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Reheat-Pizza-In-Toaster-Oven-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What settings work best for reheating pizza?

The standard bake setting at 350°F (175°C) is suitable for most pizzas, including thin and thick crust varieties. For a crispy finish, consider using the convection setting if your toaster oven has one. 

Alternatively, the broil function can quickly crisp up the top of a pizza. Place the pizza under the broiler for 2-3 minutes, checking frequently to avoid burning. 


### How long can pizza be stored before reheating?

Pizza can be safely stored at room temperature for up to 2 hours before reheating. For longer storage, place the leftover pizza in the refrigerator and reheat it within 24 hours. 

Avoid reusing the same pizza packaging if it's been refrigerated, as bacteria can grow. Transfer the pizza to a microwave-safe dish before reheating. 

![Reheat-Pizza-In-Toaster-Oven-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Reheat-Pizza-In-Toaster-Oven-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can I defrost pizza in a toaster oven?

Yes, you can defrost pizza in a toaster oven, but it may take longer than microwave defrosting. Set the oven to its lowest setting (around 170-200°F) and place the pizza inside. 

Monitor the pizza closely, as defrosting can take 30-60 minutes or longer, depending on the pizza size and initial frozen state. The pizza may need additional reheating time after defrosting. 


### What should I consider when buying a toaster oven?

While size, capacity, and power settings are important, look for features that enhance pizza reheating, such as precise temperature control, an easy-to-clean interior, and multiple baking levels. 

Also consider whether the oven has automatic shut-off when the pizza is done, and if it's easy to move the baking sheet or pizza stone in and out. Energy efficiency can affect both the cost and performance of reheating your pizza.
