## Buyer's Guide

Dog teething toys serve multiple purposes - they help soothe teething pain, prevent destructive chewing, and promote dental health. Understanding the key features and benefits will help you choose the right toy for your puppy or small dog. 


### Size and Compatibility

Select a toy that matches your pet's size. Puppies and small dogs need toys that are appropriately sized to avoid choking hazards. The toy should be firm enough to withstand chewing but not so hard that it can splinter or break into small pieces. 


### Material Durability

Look for toys made from durable materials like rubber, teething-safe plastics, or natural fabrics. These materials resist tearing and withstand prolonged chewing without breaking apart into small, ingestible pieces. Avoid toys with loose parts or questionable materials that may shed toxic substances. 


### Taste Deterrent Features

Teething toys with built-in deterrents can help prevent destructive chewing. Some toys release minty or citrus flavors when chewed, while others have textured surfaces that naturally discourage biting. These features help redirect your pet's chewing behavior to appropriate toys. 


### Size and Availability

Consider whether the toy comes in different sizes to accommodate your pet's growth. Some toys increase in size as your pet grows, while others offer multiple size options. Additionally, check if the specific toy is widely available to ensure you can consistently purchase replacement items.
