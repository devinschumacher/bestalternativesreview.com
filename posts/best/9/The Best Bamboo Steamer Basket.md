The bamboo itself should be kiln-dried to prevent moisture damage, with a watertight lid that seals during cooking. The construction quality varies between manufacturers, so look for clearly marked dimensions and sturdy joinery.

### Can bamboo steamer baskets be used in the microwave?

Bamboo steamers are not designed for microwave use due to their open structure and potential for warping at high temperatures. Attempting to microwave a bamboo steamer can damage both the basket and your microwave, potentially leading to safety hazards. 

For reheating dishes, it's best to use microwave-safe containers specifically designed for that purpose. Always refer to the manufacturer's guidelines to determine proper use and care for your bamboo steamer basket.

### What sizes are available for bamboo steamer baskets?

Bamboo steamer baskets typically come in standard sizes ranging from small (12 inches in diameter) to extra-large (17 inches in diameter). The depth of these baskets usually varies between 4-6 inches to accommodate different cooking needs. 

Some larger sets include multiple tiers, allowing you to steam multiple foods simultaneously. The size you choose should match your cooking requirements and available stove space. 


### How do bamboo steamer baskets compare to metal alternatives?

Bamboo steamers generally offer better natural moisture retention and even heat distribution, making them ideal for steaming delicate foods like fish and vegetables. They're also more lightweight and less prone to warping under high heat compared to metal baskets. 

While metal steamers may conduct heat more quickly, bamboo baskets are a safer choice for microwave usage and have a longer natural lifespan when properly cared for. Both materials have their advantages, so the choice often comes down to specific cooking needs and personal preference.
