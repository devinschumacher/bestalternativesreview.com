## FAQ


### What makes Fly Fans unique?

Our Fly Fans combine sleek design with premium performance, featuring quiet, energy-efficient motors and whisper-quiet operation. Unlike standard fans, they use proprietary AirFlow technology to maximize air movement while minimizing noise. 

Each fan includes LED illumination options and remote control capabilities, allowing you to customize both function and appearance to match your space. 


### How much space do Fly Fans cover?

Our medium-sized models cover up to 130 square feet, ideal for offices or small rooms. The larger models increase this coverage to 165 square feet, perfect for bedrooms or living areas. 

Their precisely engineered blades move air efficiently across this space, ensuring consistent cooling or circulation without wasteful turbulence. 


### What's the energy consumption like?

At their lowest setting, Fly Fans consume less than 10 watts of power – comparable to a nightlight. This efficiency continues across all speeds, making them one of the most energy-friendly fans available. 

Compared to window units or portable air conditioners, these fans deliver comparable comfort at just 1% of the energy use. 


### Are Fly Fans suitable for all rooms?

While our fans perform exceptionally well in offices and bedrooms, they're not typically recommended for rooms with high ceilings or extreme temperature variations outside. 

For optimal performance, keep them at least 18 inches from walls and furniture, and ensure the room has adequate ventilation to prevent overheating. 


### Can I use these fans safely with pets?

Our Fly Fans come with secure blade guards that prevent accidental injury. The rounded design and slowest speed settings make them particularly safe for homes with pets. 

However, always supervise pets when they're near any fan, and regularly check blade guards for proper function. 


### How do I clean my Fly Fan?

Regular maintenance keeps your Fly Fan running smoothly and efficiently. Wipe the exterior with a microfiber cloth weekly, and empty the collection chamber daily. 

For deeper cleaning, remove the blades and filter monthly. Wash these components in mild soap and water, then air dry completely before reassembly.
