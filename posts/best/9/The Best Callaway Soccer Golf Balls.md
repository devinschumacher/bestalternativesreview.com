## Buyer's Guide

When selecting Callaway soccer golf balls, several key factors influence performance and durability. Understanding these aspects helps you choose the right ball for your needs. 


### Material Construction

Modern Callaway soccer golf balls feature durable TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane) covers that resist scuffs and wear. The core design combines multi-layered rubber systems for optimal energy transfer and consistent feel.

### Weight and Size Variations

Callaway offers balls in standard (415g) and slightly lighter (400g) versions. The standard ball provides more weight and stability in flight, while the lighter option feels more like traditional soccer balls. 


### Price Considerations

Entry-level Callaway soccer golf balls range from $20-30 for a dozen. Mid-range options ($30-40) offer enhanced durability and performance. Premium balls ($40+ per dozen) deliver the longest distance and most consistent flight.

### Urethane Coating vs TPU

While both materials provide excellent durability, TPU covers (used in most Callaway models) resist water absorption better and offer improved grip in various weather conditions. Higher-end models feature premium urethane coatings for even more premium feel and appearance.

These balls retain their shape and bounce consistency better than non-waterproof alternatives, making them reliable for outdoor play in various weather conditions. 


### How do they compare to other brands?

Callaway's soccer golf balls generally perform well against competitors, offering a balanced combination of distance, accuracy, and control. The unique dual-compression core technology sets them apart from many other brands, providing consistent ball flight and energy transfer.
