When four young black creators decided to break free from mainstream comic book publishing in the 1990s, they launched Milestone Media with a bold mission: to tell stories their own way.

Though their comics faced criticism from all sides, from accusation of being too black to not black enough, Milestone established a meaningful niche in the marketplace that continues to inspire fans today.
