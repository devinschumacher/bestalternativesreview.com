## Buyer's Guide

Choosing the right infant life jacket is crucial for keeping your little one safe in or around water. Here are key factors to consider when selecting a life jacket that fits both your child and your aquatic activities. 


### Size and Fit

Infant life jackets must fit snugly to be effective. Measure your child's chest circumference and compare it to the jacket's size chart. The harness should sit comfortably just below the arm pits, and the jacket should fit like a "hug" under their arms. 

Check for adjustable straps and chest buckles that secure the jacket properly. The jacket should not twist when held at the child's sides. 

![Infant-Life-Jacket-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Infant-Life-Jacket-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Design Features

Look for high-visibility designs with reflective strips, especially for evening or low-light water activities. The jacket should have arm holes that allow full mobility for swimming, with mitts or gloves only if specifically recommended for your child's age and water conditions. 

Inflateable life jackets provide extra buoyancy but may be more complicated to maintain. Traditional foam jackets are simpler for daily use and are highly effective when properly fitted. 


### Water Test

Before each use, check the life jacket forwear and tear. Perform a water test by floating the jacket in water without the child. It should maintain its floatation position and not sink or twist. 

If the jacket has an inflation tube, ensure it releases air evenly when pinched. For inflateable models, check the pressure gauge and follow the maintenance schedule.

### Swimmer Ability

Infant life jackets are not a replacement for parent supervision or swimming lessons. They are designed to provide extra support in the water, not to prevent drowning. 

Choose a life jacket appropriate for your swimmer's skill level. Some jackets are designed for non-swimmers, while others provide minimal support for more confident swimmers. 


## FAQ

![Infant-Life-Jacket-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Infant-Life-Jacket-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What factors should I consider when choosing an infant life jacket?

Key factors include proper fit, safety certifications, and ease of use. The life jacket must fit snuggly with no loose fabric, and the neck area should sit just below the chin. Look for certifications from organizations like the UL (Underwriters Laboratories) or the ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials). 

Also consider features like quick-release clips, which allow for quick removal in an emergency, and reflective materials that improve visibility in low-light conditions. 


### How do I properly measure my child for a life jacket?

Ensure the life jacket is tried on while the child is wearing the clothing they'll wear while in the water. Stand behind the child and pull up the straps until the jacket fits snugly under the armpits, with no excess fabric. The jacket should extend from mid-chest to the thighs when the child is standing. 

Check the manufacturer's sizing chart, as some brands may have different measurements. The child should be able to move easily in the jacket, but not be able to lift up their arms completely. 

![Infant-Life-Jacket-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Infant-Life-Jacket-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How long does an infant life jacket typically last?

Most manufacturers recommend replacing life jackets every 5 years, or sooner if the jacket shows signs of wear such as tears, significant stretching, or broken straps. Check the garment for integrity before each use. 

Even if the jacket appears to be in good condition, replace it after extended use in saltwater, which can deteriorate the material faster than freshwater. 


### Can an infant wear a regular life jacket instead of an infant-specific one?

While some children may fit into a regular life jacket, these are not designed specifically for infants. Regular life jackets are larger and may not sit correctly, potentially failing to provide adequate support around the neck and head area. 

Infant-specific life jackets are made with smaller body types in mind and often include features like extended neck retention, which are crucial for proper floatation and safety. 

![Infant-Life-Jacket-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Infant-Life-Jacket-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What should I do if my infant's life jacket doesn't come with a CO2 inflation canister?

If your life jacket requires inflation and lacks a CO2 canister, consider purchasing an adaptable canister or investing in an electric inflation device. These alternatives can provide reliable inflation in an emergency. 

Alternatively, you can purchase a life jacket with CO2 inflation designed specifically for infants, which often includes the required canister. 


### How do I properly maintain an infant life jacket?

Hand wash the life jacket using mild soap and cool water, allowing it to air dry completely before each use. Avoid using harsh chemicals or machines that could damage the material. 

Inspect the jacket regularly for any signs of wear or damage, checking the straps, hinges, and any other attachments. Store the life jacket in a cool, dry place when not in use.
