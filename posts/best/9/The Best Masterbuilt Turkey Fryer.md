## Buyer's Guide

A Masterbuilt turkey fryer is a countertop appliance designed for cooking entire turkeys in a fraction of the time it would take with conventional methods. These fryers use a combination of pressure and hot oil to cook the turkey evenly, producing crispy skin and moist meat. Understanding the key features and considerations when choosing a Masterbuilt turkey fryer will help you select the right appliance for your cooking needs. 


### Capacity and Turkey Fit

When selecting a Masterbuilt turkey fryer, consider the cooking capacity that matches your family size and cooking frequency. The fryer's dimensions should allow ample space for the turkey to sit in a single layer, with at least 2-3 inches of oil surrounding the bird. Most models accommodate turkeys between 12-20 pounds, so measure your bird's maximum length and width to ensure it fits easily with some room to spare. 


### Heating Modes and Safety Features

Masterbuilt fryers typically offer both electric and natural gas heating options. Electric models are more convenient for indoor or unventilated areas, while gas units provide faster heating and are generally more powerful. Safety features like automatic shut-off, thermal limits, and visible oil level indicators are essential for preventing overheating and oil spills. Check that the fryer has a secure lid with a thermal release valve and a stable base with anti-tip legs. 


### Oil Management and Maintenance

Oil management is crucial for efficient cooking and safety. Look for a fryer with a visible window or digital display showing remaining oil volume. The unit should include a draining feature to remove excess oil after cooking and a simple system for residue removal. Consider models with self-cleaning functions or easy-to-remove parts for thorough cleaning between uses. The oil level should allow submerging the turkey while maintaining at least a 2-inch clearance around the sides for even cooking. 


### Ergonomics and Portability

Ergonomic design can make a significant difference during the cooking process. Look for a fryer with non-slip handles, a comfortable grip surface, and a lid that opens and closes easily. Portability features like wheels or a carrying handle can make moving the unit between locations more manageable. The fryer should weigh between 25-50 pounds, depending on the model, but remain lightweight enough to handle without difficulty. 


## FAQ


### What makes Masterbuilt turkey fryers different from other outdoor cooking appliances?

Masterbuilt stands out in the turkey fryer market with specialized designs optimized for this particular type of cooking. Their fryers feature deep fry baskets that securely hold turkeys of various sizes, preventing spills and ensuring food safety during the cooking process. 

These fryers also include built-in features like temperature gauges and automatic shut-off mechanisms, which are crucial for deep frying large poultry items and help prevent overheating or oil spills. 


### What's the best way to prepare a turkey for frying with a Masterbuilt fryer?

Start by removing all packaging and giblets from the turkey and thoroughly cleaning it. Using an oil injection systems (if available) can help ensure even cooking and reduce the amount of oil needed. Brining or seasoning the turkey before frying can also enhance flavors and aid in moisture retention during cooking. 

Be sure to remove any leftover brine or seasoning mix before cooking, as these can cause splattering and affect cooking temperature. The turkey should be completely thawed and dry before placing it in the fryer basket. 


### How much oil is needed for frying a turkey in a Masterbuilt fryer?

Masterbuilt fryers typically recommend using between 4 and 6 quarts of oil for a standard 12 to 16-pound turkey, depending on the specific model's specifications. The correct oil level is crucial for preventing the turkey from floating and ensuring proper cooking. 

Always check your fryer's manual for specific guidelines, as oil requirements can vary based on the fryer's design and cooking capacity. Using a measuring cup or container marked with quart measurements can help ensure the proper oil level. 


### Can I use regular vegetable oil for frying turkeys in Masterbuilt fryers?

While regular vegetable oil is commonly used, it's recommended to use lighter cooking oils like peanut or canola oil specifically recommended for deep frying. These oils have higher smoke points and can handle the higher cooking temperatures during turkey frying. 

Avoid using high-smoke-point oils like safflower oil or sunflower oil, as they may not perform well in deep-frying applications. Additionally, use fresh oil and avoid reusing it for multiple fryings to maintain food safety and flavor quality. 


### How long does it take to fry a turkey in a Masterbuilt fryer?

The cooking time for a turkey in a Masterbuilt fryer typically ranges from 30 to 45 minutes, depending on the turkey's weight and the fryer's specifications. The key is maintaining a consistent oil temperature of around 350°F to 375°F throughout the cooking process. 

Always follow the recommended cooking times and temperature guidelines provided in your fryer's manual. Overcooking can lead to a rubbery texture, while undercooking poses significant food safety risks. Using an instant-read thermometer to check the turkey's internal temperature can help ensure proper cooking. 


### What maintenance is required for a Masterbuilt turkey fryer?

Regular maintenance includes cleaning the fryer after each use to remove residue and excess oil, which can help extend the fryer's lifespan and maintain optimal performance. The fry basket and lift mechanism should be cleaned and inspected for wear before each use. 

To prepare the fryer for storage, thoroughly clean all components, including the heating element and lid, and completely drain and dry the unit before covering it. Store the fryer in a dry location away from direct sunlight to prevent rust and damage.
