A second installment in Fantagraphics Books' Acme series brings together more than just jokes â€“ it's a look at how humor has evolved through the years. The Big Book of Jokes II shows us that, just like libraries organize books by genre, this collection sorts humor into categories that make sense. The pages may show some signs of age, but that's only adding to the story of this book's journey through time. 


### [Acme Novelty Library #18 by Chris Ware](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Acme+Comics?utm\_term=acme-novelty-library-18-by-chris-ware)

This slim hardcover from Drawn & Quarterly brings together experimental tales from Chicago's South Side, where readers will get lost in the memories and ambitions of apartment-dwelling characters. At just 96 pages, it's a perfect fit for any bookshelf, though you might want to grab a magnifying glass for those teeny-tiny text parts. 


### [Acme Catalog: Quality is Our #1 Dream](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Acme+Comics?utm\_term=acme-catalog-quality-is-our-1-dream)

![Acme Catalog: Quality is Our #1 Dream | Image](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcSdVJ-\_lEHARUvwH05ZC4TEnmJqfF2YqxuNk0M2Udmjucv1MM5SHV0m4WwsCvz773lRzbsLU6rR9gskqsOppAO-z4pk5YfY&usqp=CAY)

The ACME Catalog promises to transform your life with products like a jet-powered pogo stick and a roof-mounted catapult. But this isn't your grandfather's ACME - the company's classic items have been updated for modern times. Each page is filled with imaginative gadgets and practical jokes that will make you question reality, all while marveling at the sheer creativity of a corporation that values imagination over responsibility. 


### [Acme Novelty Library #19](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Acme+Comics?utm\_term=acme-novelty-library-19)

![Acme Novelty Library #19 | Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcQHZW5hX2FCD1agAilumQmcr57UMDS\_gZEH45UoDOKoygTjpLDi2cy57V3uZYCLFtddYaZFbw6tV6m1b4hfTTSXh79wFKD5hg&usqp=CAY)

This 2008 hardcover from Drawn and Quarterly features 80 pages of Chris Ware's work, specifically exploring W. K. Brown's contributions to speculative fiction. The story "The Seeing Eye Dogs of Mars" earned Brown the White Dwarf Award for Best New Writer in the 1950s, though his subsequent work paled in comparison to the psychovisionary movement led by Anton Jones and J. Sterling Imbroglio. As Brown's influence began to be recognized in modern scholarship, Ware weaves these insights into a narrative that examines the writer's increasingly influential legacy within the world of speculative fiction. 


### [Acme Novelty Datebook Volume Three](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Acme+Comics?utm\_term=acme-novelty-datebook-volume-three)

![Acme Novelty Datebook Volume Three | Image](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcRyyAcRlan9Oa9ywA8f9ydKo1sKAmiTBHMFKaEhzQcVLVc-mQiKr3k4Fp-FmlQjc7ErIMZWfCFoK5Ye-bBEh6vD6APTcPSFyg&usqp=CAY)

The final chapter in F. C. Ware's sketchbook saga sees the artist chronicling three decades of observational drawings, from bus rides to airport waits, with his signature blend of crude humor and private musings. Bound in deceptively demure paper boards, this 208-page collection deserves special mention for its clever use of annotations and a cheeky "professional apology" that rounds out Ware's reliably unreliable self-narrative.

Set in a Chicago apartment building around the year 2000, ACME Novelty Library #18 explores characters' memories and personal ambitions through Ware's signature experimentally grim narrative style. The collection, featuring stories reframed from alternative weeklies and coffee-table magazines, presents an engaging look at modern life through Ware's distinctive visual storytelling.

This second volume of Chris Ware's sketchbook captures the artist's work from 1995 to the present, featuring his signature pen and ink drawings along with watercolor pieces. The collection has been carefully curated to remove any personal or legally sensitive material, making it appealing for fans of Ware's distinctive artistic style. The hardcover edition maintains an attractive design while offering readers a reliable addition to their fine art collection.

This beautifully crafted hardcover volume captures the creative process of acclaimed artist Chris Ware, offering readers a behind-the-scenes look at the sketches and drafts that led to his groundbreaking graphic novel Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth. The collection showcases Ware's remarkable versatility, from architectural drawings of Chicago to imaginative robot comics, all brought together in a companion piece to one of the most influential graphic novels of the past decade.
