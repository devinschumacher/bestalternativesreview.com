## Buyer's Guide

The Taylormade P760 is a versatile iron set that combines TaylorMade's advanced engineering with their commitment to player feedback. This guide outlines key features and considerations to help you determine if the P760 meets your performance needs. 


### Blade vs. Bladeship Design

The P760 employs TaylorMade's Bladeship technology, featuring a lower profile and thinner topline for increased versatility. This design differs from traditional blades, offering better heel-toe stability while maintaining the feel and looks of a blade iron. 


### Forged Construction

These irons are forged from 1025 pearlitic carbon steel, ensuring precise dimensions and optimal weight distribution. The Forged Filling design integrates a steel face with the body, allowing for thinner faces and improved ball control compared to non-forged alternatives. 


### Tour-Style Grooves

The P760 features precise, tour-inspired V-grooves that promote consistent ball striking and reliable spin. The sole geometry is optimized for both soft and firm conditions, with the longer irons featuring a deeper sole for better stability and ball-striking. 


### Shaft Options and Flexes

The set comes with 36" graphite shafts across all irons, with four flex options ranging from L to X. The shafts feature a custom blend of carbon fiber for maximum energy transfer. While these are the standard equipment, players may consider customization to find their ideal flex and weight distribution.
