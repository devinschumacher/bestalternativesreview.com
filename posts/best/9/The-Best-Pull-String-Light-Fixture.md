### What is a pull string light fixture?

A pull string light fixture is a classic ceiling or wall-mounted lighting option that uses a simple cord to control the light's intensity. By pulling the cord, users adjust the shade's position, revealing more or less light as needed. 

The design allows for three-way lighting, meaning you can select between three distinct brightness levels by pulling the cord different lengths. 


### How does a pull string light fixture work?

The light fixture contains a shade suspended from a cord connected to a wiper mechanism. When you pull the cord, it moves the wiper to cover or expose different areas of the light source, controlling the amount of light that reaches the room. 

The cord is connected to a three-way switch, allowing you to select from three preset brightness levels. Each pull length corresponds to a specific lighting setting.
