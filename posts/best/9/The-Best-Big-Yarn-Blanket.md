## Buyer's Guide

A big yarn blanket combines warmth, texture, and visual appeal, making it a versatile addition to any living space. When selecting a yarn blanket, consider factors like material quality, size options, and design elements to find a piece that matches your needs and style preferences. 


### Material Quality

Yarn blankets vary in quality based on the type of fiber used. High-quality materials like pure wool, alpaca, or cashmere provide durability and premium softness. Consider the yarn count or fiber content for guidance on materials. Higher-quality yarns often have a longer lifespan and better insulation properties.

### Size Options

Blanket sizes range from small throw options to oversized accent pieces. Common sizes include twin (60" x 80"), queen (80" x 90"), and king (108" x 90") throws. Think about where the blanket will be used - living room floor throws need extra length and width for comfort, while bed throws can be smaller. 


### Design Elements

Yarn blankets come in various designs, from solid colors to intricate patterns. Consider your room's color scheme and existing decor when selecting a design. Textured patterns add visual interest, while simple solids offer versatility. Check the blanket's backing material - some patterns look better on specific backings.
