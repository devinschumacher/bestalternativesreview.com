## Buyer's Guide

Noxygen devices represent a growing segment in outdoor and portable entertainment systems, offering users a convenient way to pair multiple audio devices through a single speaker setup. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the right Noxygen device for your needs. 


### Connection Capabilities

Look for devices that support multiple connection methods such as Bluetooth, Aux input, and USB connectivity. This versatility allows you to stream music from various sources including smartphones, tablets, and computers. Consider the maximum number of concurrent connections supported, as some devices allow pairing with up to three or more devices simultaneously. 


### Audio Performance

Key audio specifications include frequency response range, total harmonic distortion (THD), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Higher values in these metrics generally indicate better sound quality. Additionally, check if the device offers different EQ presets or customization options to suit various music genres and listening environments. 


### Battery Life and Power Consumption

Battery capacity directly impacts playback duration, with most Noxygen devices offering between 6-12 hours of continuous playback on a single charge. Factor in the power consumption of connected devices, as simultaneous streaming may reduce overall battery life. Quick charging capabilities and the ability to maintain power while the source device is locked or in sleep mode are also valuable features. 


### Portability and Build Quality

Materials like aluminum or metal provide durability but weigh more than plastic alternatives. For portable speakers, lighter materials with water-resistant coatings are preferable, especially for outdoor use. The speaker dimensions and weight should balance audio performance with manageable portability. Consider additional features like carrying handles, built-in hooks, or strap loops for easy transport.
