## Buyer's Guide

Tiki Cat wet food comes in various flavors and sizes, offering both nutritional value and convenience for pet owners. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you choose the right product for your cat. 


### Ingredients and Nutrition

A quality tiki cat wet food should list real meat as the primary ingredient, followed by nourishing additives like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Check the nutrition panel for balanced levels of protein, fat, and carbohydrates suitable for your cat's age and health needs. 


### Flavor and Variety

Cats have unique taste preferences, so it's important to try different flavors to find what they enjoy. Consider variety in your selection to ensure your cat receives a broad spectrum of nutrients and maintains an interest in their food. 


### Portion Control and Feeding Guidelines

Wet food should complement your cat's overall diet rather than replace it entirely. Follow the feeding guidelines on the package and adjust based on your cat's weight, activity level, and specific health requirements. 


### Storage and Freshness

Proper storage is crucial for maintaining wet food's quality and safety. Once opened, transfer the food to an airtight container and refrigerate. Check for any signs of spoilage before serving, including changes in color, odor, or texture. 


## FAQ


### What is Tiki Cat wet food made of?

Tiki Cat wet food features fresh, human-grade ingredients with real-filed meats as the first ingredient, including salmon, chicken, turkey, and beef. The recipes also include nutritious additions like green peas, potatoes, and carrots for added fiber and vitamins. 

Each meal is prepared in small batches and cooked to lock in natural flavors and nutrients. The food comes in convenient portions that help prevent waste and maintain freshness. 


### How much Tiki Cat wet food should I feed my cat?

The feeding guidelines are based on your cat's age, weight, and activity level. As a general rule, adult cats should receive 1/2 to 2/3 cup per meal, divided into two feedings daily. 

Puppies and kittens have different nutritional needs. Consult your veterinarian for specific recommendations based on your pet's growth stage and activity level. 


### What size containers does Tiki Cat use?

The mainline products come in 6-ounce cans featuring Tiki Cat's distinctive cartoon cat design. These convenient portions are perfect for mealtime, with each can providing one complete serving of a specific recipe. 

The company also offers a line of 8-ounce cans for easier transportation and storage of multiple meals at once. 


### Can I give my cat treats from the Tiki Cat wet food containers?

While Tiki Cat wet food is delicious, feeding your cat exclusively from the same container that holds treats and meals can confuse their sense of hunger and fullness. Use dedicated feeding and treat dishes for optimal nutrition and portion control. 

If you choose to offer treats from the same container, make sure to monitor your cat's overall food intake to prevent overfeeding. 


### How should I store Tiki Cat wet food?

Once opened, transfer the remaining food to an airtight container in your refrigerator. Use within 24-48 hours for best quality and safety. Always check for signs of spoilage before feeding. 

Unopened cans should be stored in a cool, dry place. They will remain fresh for several weeks past the "best by" date printed on the container. 


### Is Tiki Cat wet food suitable for all cats?

Designed for cats over 6 months old, the wet food is a nutritious addition to any balanced diet. However, cats with specific health conditions or dietary restrictions should consult their veterinarian before making changes to their diet. 

Tiki Cat offers a variety of recipes to accommodate different preferences and nutritional needs. Each meal should be introduced gradually to prevent digestive upset.
