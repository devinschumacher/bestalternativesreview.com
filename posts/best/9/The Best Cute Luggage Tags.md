Traveling with a personal item requires proper identification to prevent loss or misplacement. A cute luggage tag serves both functional and decorative purposes, helping you quickly identify your belongings at airports or hotels. 


### Size and Shape

Select a tag that fits your item - smaller tags for accessories like purses, and larger ones for backpacks or suitcases. Consider the tag's shape: keychain-style tags are easy to attach and remove, while clip-on tags offer quick access to your contact information.
