### How does Gatorade Frost compare to other Gatorade products?

Gatorade Frost offers similar benefits to traditional Gatorade products, with electrolytes and carbohydrates to support athletic performance. However, it's more portable and convenient for travel or on-the-go hydration. 

The flavor profile is consistent with Gatorade's existing lineup, offering options like Mixed Berry, Lemon-Lime, and others that are popular with athletes and active individuals.

### How should I store Gatorade Frost?

The pouches should be stored in a cool, dry place when unopened. Once opened, mix the contents with water immediately and consume promptly. Store any unused portion in the refrigerator.
