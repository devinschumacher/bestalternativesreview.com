## Buyer's Guide

Energy Star-rated dehumidifiers combine effective moisture control with energy efficiency, making them a smart choice for maintaining comfortable indoor conditions. Understanding key features and considerations will help you select a reliable dehumidifier that meets your needs while saving energy. 


### Capacity and Coverage Area

Select a dehumidifier with a capacity that matches your space size. Common ratings include 30, 70, and 150 pints per day. Consider the room's square footage and whether you need humidity control year-round or seasonally when determining appropriate capacity. 


### Energy Efficiency

Look for models with high Energy Star ratings and efficient motor designs. The energy consumption should be listed in watts, with lower numbers indicating better efficiency. Consider the power usage during both normal operation and when running at maximum capacity. 


### Maintenance Requirements

Evaluate the ease of filter cleaning, collection bucket emptying, and overall maintenance. Regular maintenance affects both the machine's longevity and its performance. Consider models with automatic drain options or advanced filter designs that reduce cleaning frequency.

Select a dehumidifier with sound levels below 50 decibels for quiet operation during the night or when placed in living spaces. Additional features like humidity sensors, digital displays, and remote controls can enhance convenience while ensuring consistent performance. 


## FAQ


### What is an Energy Star dehumidifier?

Energy Star dehumidifiers are highly efficient appliances that remove excess moisture from the air, maintaining indoor comfort and preventing mold growth. These models meet strict energy efficiency guidelines set by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), helping users save electricity while effectively managing humidity levels. 

Sponsored by the EPA, the Energy Star certification ensures that dehumidifiers consume less energy without compromising performance. This certification helps consumers identify the most energy-efficient models on the market, promoting environmental sustainability and cost savings. 


### How much moisture can an Energy Star dehumidifier remove?

The moisture removal capacity of Energy Star dehumidifiers ranges from 30 to 70 pints per day, depending on the model and operating conditions. These appliances efficiently reduce indoor humidity levels, typically removing 1.5 to 4 pints of water per hour in standard household settings. 

The actual humidity removal capacity varies based on the amount of moisture in the air (measured by Relative Humidity, or RH), with higher capacities achieved in more humid environments. For optimal performance, operate the dehumidifier in rooms with a RH of 70% or less, and empty the water tank daily when necessary. 


### What size room is best for an Energy Star dehumidifier?

Energy Star dehumidifiers are designed for various room sizes. Smaller models handle rooms up to 350 square feet, while larger units manage areas up to 1,350 square feet. The ideal unit capacity depends on room size, insulation quality, and moisture sources like bathrooms or laundry areas. 

For accurate sizing, multiply room length by width to determine square footage. Consider additional factors like proximity to humid sources, ventilation, and outdoor humidity levels when selecting a dehumidifier size. Running multiple small dehumidifiers may be more effective than a single large unit in certain situations. 


### How much electricity do Energy Star dehumidifiers use?

Energy Star dehumidifiers consume between 145 and 545 watts, with most models using 250-350 watts during operation. The specific energy consumption varies based on moisture removal capacity and operating conditions, with more efficient models using less electricity for the same performance level. 

To calculate annual energy costs, divide the wattage by 1,000 to get kilowatt usage, then multiply by the number of hours per day and days per year the dehumidifier runs. Most Energy Star dehumidifiers cost between $10 and $20 per year in electricity, depending on usage and local electricity rates. 


### What features should I look for in an Energy Star dehumidifier?

Key features include automatic defrost, adjustable humidity settings, quiet operation (50dB or less), and easy tank drainage. Look for models with digital displays, automatic shut-off, and energy-saving modes. Some advanced models include moisture sensors, multiple fan speeds, and adjustable feet for stability. 

Consider portability options like casters or wheels for moving between rooms, as well as maintenance features like washable filters and removable drip pans. ENERGY STAR-rated models also offer features like indicator lights, LCD displays, and remote controls as standard offerings, improving usability and convenience. 


### How often should I clean an Energy Star dehumidifier?

For optimal performance and hygiene, clean the water tank and collection bucket daily. The evaporator coil requires monthly cleaning using a soft-bristled brush and mild soap solution, following the manufacturer's instructions. The plastic filter should be cleaned or replaced every two months, depending on usage and local air quality. 

Empty the collection bucket regularly to prevent overflow and water damage, especially during periods of low humidity when the dehumidifier runs less frequently. Clean the entire unit every three to six months using a mixture of water and white vinegar, ensuring all components are completely dry before reuse.
