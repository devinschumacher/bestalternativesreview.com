## Buyer's Guide

A cheap Keurig coffee maker combines convenience and affordability, making it an attractive option for regular coffee drinkers. Understanding the key features and considerations helps you find a reliable machine that suits your needs without breaking the bank. 


### Capacity and Brew Sizes

Cheap Keurig machines typically offer between 5 and 12 cup capacities, with some models allowing single-serve brewing. The brew size range usually spans from 4 to 7 ounces, ideal for standard K-Cup pods. 


### Power Consumption and Energy Efficiency

## FAQ


### What makes a Keurig "cheap"?

A "cheap" Keurig typically refers to models within the $50-100 price range, which offer basic functionality at an affordable cost. These machines usually lack advanced features found in higher-end models. 

The term "cheap" also implies limited durability compared to premium Keurig models, with some budget-friendly options potentially requiring more frequent maintenance or parts replacement.

Some basic models might be limited to single-cup brewing only, without the option for thermal carafes or brewing multiple cups simultaneously. 


### Which cheap Keurig models are known for durability?

The Keurig K-Classic and K-Elite models are popular choices in this price range, known for their reliable performance and lasting quality. These models have earned positive reviews for their durability compared to some competitors in the same category.
