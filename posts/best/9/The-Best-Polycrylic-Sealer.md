## Buyer's Guide

Polycrylic sealer is a clear, water-based protective coating that enhances the appearance and durability of various surfaces, including wood, metal, and concrete. Understanding its key properties and application requirements will help you select the appropriate product for your project. 


### Compatibility

Ensure the polycrylic sealer is compatible with the substrate material and any existing coatings. Check product labels for specific compatibility information. Commonly used with wood, metal, and concrete, but verify suitability for materials like plastic or rubber.

### Performance Characteristics

Look for products with superior water resistance, UV protection, and chemical resistance based on your application needs. Higher-quality sealers provide better protection against fading, cracking, and peeling over time.

### Cost Considerations

Compare the cost of different products based on coverage rate and application requirements. Higher performance sealers often provide better long-term protection but may have a higher upfront cost. Factor in the need for additional materials like primer or additional coats when calculating total expenses. 


## FAQ

![Polycrylic-Sealer-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Polycrylic-Sealer-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is Polycrylic Sealer?

Polycrylic sealer is a versatile clear coating that provides superior protection for various surfaces, including furniture, floors, and crafts. It bonds with the underlying substrate to create a durable, water-resistant layer that enhances durability and maintains the original appearance of the treated surface. 

Developed specifically for polyurethane-based products, this fast-drying sealer offers exceptional adhesion and chemical resistance while remaining nearly invisible after application. 


### How long does it take for Polycrylic Sealer to cure?

The curing time for polycrylic sealer typically ranges from 4 to 24 hours, depending on environmental conditions and thickness of application. Complete cure occurs within 28 days, after which the surface will have reached its maximum durability and water resistance. 

During the curing period, keep the protected surface free from dust and premature exposure to harsh chemicals to ensure optimal performance. 

![Polycrylic-Sealer-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Polycrylic-Sealer-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can Polycrylic Sealer be applied over existing polyurethane finishes?

Yes, polycrylic sealer can be applied directly over existing polyurethane finishes without the need for additional primers or surface preparations. Its chemical compatibility ensures a strong bond with existing coatings while providing enhanced protection. 

For best results, ensure the surface is clean, dry, and free from any residual oils or contaminants before applying the sealer. 


### What surfaces are compatible with Polycrylic Sealer?

While designed primarily for use with polyurethane-based products, polycrylic sealer can also be applied to untreated surfaces such as wood, metal, ceramic, and many plastics. It's particularly effective on furniture, floors, and decorative items requiring water resistance and UV protection. 

Avoid using it on porous materials like natural stone or untreated wood, as these surfaces may require additional sealing or treatment before applying polycrylic sealer. 

![Polycrylic-Sealer-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Polycrylic-Sealer-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How should Polycrylic Sealer be stored?

Store polycrylic sealer in its original container, keeping it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and extreme temperature fluctuations. Proper storage helps maintain the product's consistency and prevents premature drying or separation of its components. 

Always ensure the container is tightly sealed when not in use to protect the integrity of the sealer and prevent contamination from dust or air particles. 


### What is the shelf life of Polycrylic Sealer?

When properly stored in its original container, polycrylic sealer has an extended shelf life of 12-18 months. Older products may develop a thicker consistency or separation of components, so it's recommended to perform a small test application before large-scale use to verify the sealer's effectiveness. 

If the product shows signs of separation or thickening, it may need to be shaken well before use or subjected to a brief stir to restore its proper consistency.
