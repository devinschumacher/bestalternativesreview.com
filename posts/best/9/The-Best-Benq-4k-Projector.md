## Buyer's Guide

Benq's 4K projectors offer a compelling combination of image quality and value, making them a popular choice for home theater enthusiasts. When selecting a Benq 4K projector, you'll want to consider several key factors to ensure you choose the right model for your space and viewing preferences. 


### Resolution and Image Quality

At the core of any 4K projector is its ability to display sharp, detailed imagery. Look for models with true 4K UHD resolution (3840 x 2160 pixels) rather than scaled or interpolated 4K, which can compromise image quality. Pay attention to native contrast ratio and brightness levels, as these significantly impact blacks and overall picture clarity. 


### Light Source Technology

Benq 4K projectors use LCD technology with either LED or laser illumination. LED models offer good balance between brightness and longevity, while laser projectors provide higher brightness and longer life spans but at a premium price point. Consider your room's lighting conditions and daily usage needs to select the most suitable technology. 


### Installation and Setup Requirements

The throw distance and dimension requirements vary between models. Calculate the distance from your screen to projector based on the lens throw ratio and native resolution. Also, note any specific installation needs like vertical lens shift, keystone correction, or color temperature adjustments. 


### Audio and Connectivity Options

While audio quality typically needs external speakers, projectors with built-in stereo or DTS Virtual: X support can be convenient. For streaming and connectivity, look for models with multiple HDMI inputs, USB ports, and Wi-Fi capabilities. Consider your device compatibility and streaming requirements when selecting connectivity options. 


## FAQ


### What is a 4k projector?

4k projectors display images with four times the detail of 1080p HD, using 3840 x 2160 resolution. This technology produces sharp, lifelike images ideal for movie watching and gaming. 

4k projectors use either native 4k panels or upscaling from lower resolutions. They require larger screens to fully display the resolution's benefits.

Benq 4k projectors typically offer 2000 to 3000 ANSI lumens, making them suitable for home theater rooms with moderate ambient light. The W1000ST features 2800 ANSI lumens for enhanced brightness. 

For darker rooms, consider models with higher brightness or those that support HDR10 for better picture quality. The W1000ST's 4k performance is particularly notable, offering 3000 ANSI lumens with 100% color volume.

### Are Benq 4k projectors worth the extra cost?

4k projectors generally cost more than 1080p models, but the higher resolution and improved color accuracy often justify the additional expense. 

The extra cost is particularly worth it for home theater enthusiasts who prioritize picture quality and want to future-proof their setup for 4k content. 


### What accessories are needed for a Benq 4k projector?

You'll need a screen, cables, and possibly a mounting kit. Consider a remote with 4k capabilities and a power surge protector for better performance.
