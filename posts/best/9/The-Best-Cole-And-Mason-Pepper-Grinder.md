A Cole And Mason pepper grinder is a specialized kitchen tool designed for freshly grinding whole peppercorns. These grinders combine durability with classic design, making them a popular choice among both amateur and professional cooks. 


### Materials and Finish

Cole And Mason grinders typically feature a cast-iron body and stainless steel mechanism. The solid construction prevents leaks and ensures consistent pepper grinding. The premium finish resists scratches and maintains its appearance over time.
