## Buyer's Guide

Hampton Bay patio heaters combine style with functionality, providing warmth while enhancing outdoor living spaces. Understanding their key features and specifications will help you choose the right heater for your needs. 


### Output and Coverage

Heaters are rated by BTU (British Thermal Units), indicating their heating capacity. For most outdoor spaces, 20,000-30,000 BTUs covers 150-250 square feet. Consider the space's shape and whether it's open or enclosed to determine appropriate coverage. 


### Heat Distribution

Look for heaters with adjustable or oscillating features to distribute heat effectively. Radiant heaters focus heat in one direction, while convection heaters circulate air. Understanding these principles helps select a heater that warms the desired area efficiently. 


### Materials and Durability

Outdoor heaters need robust construction. The housing should be made of weather-resistant materials like aluminum or stainless steel. Check for moisture protection features, as rust and corrosion can reduce longevity. 


### Power Source and Operating Costs

Most patio heaters use natural gas or propane, which offer consistent heat without electrical limitations. Consider your power source availability and compare heating costs to your budget. Energy-efficient models reduce operating expenses. 


## FAQ

The heaters include automatic shut-off features for safety and come with adjustable controls for precise temperature management. With warranties up to 5 years, they represent a reliable investment for outdoor heating needs. 


### Which Hampton Bay heater model is best for my patio?

The right model depends on your patio size and heating requirements. Models range from compact 9,000 BTU to larger 30,000 BTU versions, with options including natural gas, liquid propane, and electric heating. 

Consider factors like expected temperature drops, wind protection, and available power sources when selecting the ideal heater for your outdoor space.

Hampton Bay patio heaters are designed for outdoor use and should never be operated indoors. Running an outdoor heater indoors can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning and damage the unit's components. 

Always follow manufacturer guidelines and use the heater in accordance with its intended environment to ensure safety and optimal performance. 


### What's included with a Hampton Bay patio heater?

Each heater comes with essential accessories such as mounting brackets, propane conversion kits (for gas models), and a manufacturer's warranty. Some models include remote controls and portable bases. 

Check the specific product page for detailed included parts, as the standard package configuration can vary between models. 


### How do I maintain a Hampton Bay heater?

Clean the heater's heat exchanger and burners regularly using the manufacturer's recommended methods to maintain efficiency. Check gas connections for leaks and ensure the unit is level before each use. 

Store the heater properly during off-season and inspect for any visible damage before each heating season. Following these basic maintenance steps will help extend the life of your Hampton Bay heater. 


### What's the typical operating cost of these heaters?

The cost varies based on your heater's size, fuel type, and local energy prices. As a general rule, larger heaters will have higher upfront costs but can provide more warmth per use. 

To estimate your operating costs, multiply your heater's BTU output by the number of hours you plan to use it, then divide by 100,000 to find the approximate energy consumption in therms. Multiply this by your local propane or natural gas rate to get an estimated cost per hour of operation.
