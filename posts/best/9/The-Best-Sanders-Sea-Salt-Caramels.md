## FAQ

![Sanders-Sea-Salt-Caramels-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Sanders-Sea-Salt-Caramels-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What makes Sanders Sea Salt Caramels unique?

Sanders Sea Salt Caramels stand out in the candy market through their distinctive blend of rich caramel flavor with the subtle, slightly briny kick of sea salt. Unlike traditional caramels that might use processed table salt, these candies incorporate premium sea salt, which dissolves slowly for a more nuanced flavor experience. 

The distinctive sea salt caramel's texture remains chewy and caramel-like, with the salt crystals adding an unexpected crunch that complements the soft, buttery caramels rather than overwhelming their natural sweetness. 


### Where can I find Sanders Sea Salt Caramels?

The Sanders brand typically distributes its sea salt caramel candies through specialty candy shops, gourmet food retailers, and online marketplaces. Major supermarkets with strong candy sections may also carry them, but availability can vary by region. 

For those who want to order directly from the manufacturer, the Sanders website offers convenient online ordering with free shipping on orders over a certain threshold, making it easy to get these unique candies delivered to your door. 

![Sanders-Sea-Salt-Caramels-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Sanders-Sea-Salt-Caramels-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Are Sanders Sea Salt Caramels suitable for all dietary needs?

While the caramel itself is dairy-free, the candies contain sugar, corn syrup solids, and are produced in a facility that processes tree nuts and peanuts. This means they're not suitable for individuals with severe allergies to these ingredients. 

The candies do not contain artificial flavors or colors, making them a better option for people who prefer natural ingredients. However, as with any candy, they should be enjoyed in moderation as they are high in sugar and calories. 


### What is the recommended serving size?

Each candy is individually wrapped to maintain freshness and prevent sticking. The suggested serving size is one piece, which weighs approximately 1.3 ounces (37 grams). This portion provides about 150 calories and 22 grams of sugar. 

Enjoying the candies in moderation is recommended, as they are designed to be a delightful treat rather than a regular part of one's diet. 

![Sanders-Sea-Salt-Caramels-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Sanders-Sea-Salt-Caramels-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How should I store Sanders Sea Salt Caramels?

These candies are best stored at room temperature in an airtight container to maintain their freshness and prevent them from sticking together. Avoid exposing them to extreme temperatures or direct sunlight, which can affect the texture and caramel quality. 

If you're keeping them for an extended period, consider purchasing them with a shorter expiration date to ensure the best flavor and texture when you're ready to enjoy them. 


### Are Sanders Sea Salt Caramels suitable for baking?

While the candies are not designed for baking, some adventurous bakers have successfully used them to create homemade caramel popcorn or as a topping for homemade ice cream. The candies' high sugar content and potential to stick together make them less ideal for complex recipes that require melting or mixing with other ingredients. 

The sea salt caramel's texture and flavor work best when enjoyed as a single piece, giving you the full candy experience rather than incorporating it into more sophisticated recipes.
