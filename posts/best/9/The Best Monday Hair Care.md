## Buyer's Guide

Monday hair care routines often set the tone for the rest of the week, making it crucial to establish a regimen that promotes healthy, manageable locks. This guide outlines key factors to consider when choosing hair care products, helping you select items that address your specific needs and concerns. 


### Hair Type and Concerns

Understanding your hair type (normal, oily, dry, or combination) and identifying any specific concerns (itching, dandruff, splitting ends) is essential. Different products perform best on different hair types, and addressing specific concerns requires targeted ingredients. 


### Product Ingredients

Key ingredients vary based on hair type and concerns. Look for moisturizing agents like ceramides and hyaluronic acid for dry hair, salicylic acid or tea tree oil for dandruff, and antioxidants like vitamins C and E for scalp health. Avoid harsh chemicals unless your hair requires special treatment. 


### Formulations and Application

Consider the product's base formula (water-based, oil-based, or gel-like) and how it interacts with your hair type. Concentrated products may be ideal for oily scalps, while lightweight options work well for dry hair. Application techniques also vary, from scalp massages to scalp scrubs, depending on the product's intended effect. 


### Regimen Frequency

The frequency of use depends on both product type and hair needs. Some treatments work best daily, while others should be applied weekly or monthly. Pay attention to your hair's reaction to different frequencies, adjusting as needed to maintain optimal health and appearance. 


## FAQ


### What are the key ingredients in Monday hair care products?

Monday products contain a blend of nourishing ingredients, including natural oils, vitamins, and minerals. Common components include avocado oil for deep hydration, biotin for strengthening, and vitamin E as an antioxidant. 

These ingredients work together to repair damage, promote healthy growth, and enhance overall hair quality, making Monday products suitable for various hair types and concerns. 


### How do I use the deep conditioning mask?

Apply a generous amount to clean, towel-dried hair, focusing on the mid-lengths to ends. Cover with a shower cap and leave on for 20-30 minutes before rinsing thoroughly. 

This treatment can be used weekly for intensive repair or monthly as part of your regular hair care routine. 


### Can I use these products if I have color-treated hair?

Monday products are formulated for all hair types, including color-treated hair. The natural ingredients are gentle on color, helping to maintain its vibrancy while providing nourishment and protection. 

For best results, avoid applying products directly to the roots and always complete your color maintenance routine as instructed by your stylist. 


### Are these products suitable for daily use?

The daily care shampoo and conditioner are designed for regular use, but it's recommended to wash your hair every other day to maintain the product's effectiveness and preserve natural oils. 

If your hair is very dirty or you swim regularly, daily use is acceptable. Always listen to your hair's needs and adjust your routine accordingly. 


### Is the styling cream suitable for all hair types?

The styling cream works well for most hair types, including curly, straight, and fine hair. Its flexible hold allows for easy styling without leaving residue. 

For oily scalp types or those with very curly hair, you may want to apply a small amount and distribute it with your fingers for better control. 


### How do I know which product to use?

Start by assessing your hair type and any specific concerns (like dryness, frizz, or damage). Monday products are generally suitable for all types, so you can try the basic shampoo and conditioner first. 

If you have specific needs, consider the targeted treatments available, such as the deep conditioning mask for severe dryness or the color protection spray for chemically treated hair.
