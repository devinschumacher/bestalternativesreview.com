## Buyer's Guide

Cleto Reyes boxing gloves combine performance features with durability for both beginners and experienced fighters. When selecting boxing gloves, consider padding type and amount, wrist support, glove weight, and moisture management to find the right balance of protection and mobility. 


### Padding and Protection

Cleto Reyes gloves typically offer shock-absorbing padding in critical impact areas: the knuckles, palm, and wrist. The padding density varies by model, with heavier padding offering more protection at the cost of reduced punch speed. Premium gloves often use dual-density foam for targeted protection without sacrificing responsiveness.

### Glove Construction and Weight

The base glove structure affects both protection and dexterity. Common materials include synthetic leather for durability and double-stitched seams for longevity. Gloves range from 8 to 14 ounces in weight, with lighter gloves providing faster punch deployment for beginners and heavier gloves offering more protection for advanced fighters. 


### Wrist Support and Wrapping

Effective wrist support prevents injury during impact and improves strike power. High-quality gloves feature reinforced wrist guards and adjustable closures. For additional protection, boxers often wear bandage wraps around their wrists, which the gloves should accommodate with ample room for proper application.

### Mobility and Venting

While protection is crucial, glove design should not restrict natural hand movement. Look for flexible knuckle caps, breathable mesh panels, and strategic ventilation to maintain hand comfort during intense training sessions. Proper finger spacing and thumb support prevent slippage during strikes.

![Cleto Reyes Boxing Gloves-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cleto+Reyes+Boxing+Gloves-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What makes Cleto Reyes boxing gloves different from other gloves?

Cleto Reyes gloves are known for their quality craftsmanship and practical design choices. They offer a good balance between protection and dexterity, with features like reinforced knuckles and padded palms to protect your hands during training. 

The gloves are also well-ventilated, helping to keep your hands cool during workouts. The sizing runs a bit smaller than some other brands, so it's important to measure your hand size before purchasing. 


### How long do Cleto Reyes gloves last?

With regular use, these gloves should last around 6-12 months, depending on your training intensity and how well you maintain them. The quality leather and reinforced stitching help them hold up well to repeated use. 

You should expect some natural wear and tear, particularly around the palms and knuckles, after several months of consistent training. Regular cleaning and proper storage can extend their lifespan.

### Are these gloves suitable for all boxing styles?

The Cleto Reyes gloves are versatile enough for different boxing styles, from technical sparring to heavy bag work. The medium-weight padding provides adequate protection for all types of punches and hits. 

However, if you're looking for extremely heavy protection or are training for competition, you might want to consider gloves with more padding. These gloves work well for most amateur and recreational boxers. 


### How do I clean my boxing gloves?

Regular maintenance is important to keep your boxing gloves in good condition. You can clean them with mild soap and water after each use. For tougher grime, you can use a soft-bristled brush to scrub the palms and knuckles gently. 

Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the leather. After washing, shake off excess water and allow the gloves to air dry completely before wearing them again.

### What size should I choose?

Cleto Reyes boxing gloves run small, so it's recommended to order a half-size larger than your regular glove size. For example, if you usually wear a medium, you should consider ordering a large. 

Proper sizing is crucial for both comfort and safety. Your gloves should fit snugly but allow full wrist movement. The fingertips should be in direct contact with the palm padding when the gloves are on and your hands are relaxed. 


### How much do these gloves weigh?

The standard weight for Cleto Reyes boxing gloves is 12 ounces. This provides a good balance between protection and dexterity, suitable for most training purposes. 

If you're new to boxing or prefer lighter gloves, you might consider the 8-ounce version instead. The heavier 16-ounce gloves are typically reserved for competition or training with heavy bags.
