## Buyer's Guide

Oxo booster seats are popular among parents for safely raising children to the proper height for using vehicle seatbelts. These portable seats attach directly to the vehicle seat and come with built-in tray tables and drink holders. Key considerations include weight capacity, height adjustment options, and compatibility with different vehicle seat types. 


### Weight Capacity

Oxo booster seats typically support children weighing between 30-100 pounds. The weight capacity ensures the seat can safely support your growing child during the booster seat stage. Some models have higher capacities than others, so check the specific seat's weight limit based on your child's size. 


### Height Adjustment Options

Elevating seats with incremental height adjustments allow you to find the right boost for your child's current height and position the seatbelt chest clip correctly at the shoulder level. Some models offer fixed height settings, which may be less versatile for accommodating different vehicle seats or child sizes. 


### Vehicle Seat Compatibility

The seatback angle and width of your vehicle seat affect booster seat positioning. Oxo seats designed for forward-facing use have compatible features like angle indicators and sliding mechanisms to adapt to various seat types. Rear-facing compatible seats have different design considerations for proper harness positioning. 


### Additional Features

Look for extra amenities like padded backs and bases for comfort, inflatable side wings for stability, and dishwasher-safe designs for easy cleaning. The included tray table and drink holder help keep kids entertained during trips. Some models feature built-in storage for essentials or reflective vests for increased visibility.
