## Buyer's Guide

Bergamota shampoo combines natural ingredients with modern formulas to deliver a refreshing wash for your scalp and hair. Understanding what makes a quality bergamota shampoo requires knowledge of its key components and how they benefit your hair. 


### Key Ingredients

Bergamot essential oil provides the signature citrus scent and can help control scalp bacteria. Natural extracts like aloe vera and chamomile soothe irritation while moisturizing the scalp. Surfactants help cleanse without stripping natural oils, and humectants retain moisture, leaving hair soft and manageable.

### Formulation Considerations

Look for shampoos that balance cleaning power with scalp care. An effective formula will remove dirt and oil while promoting healthy scalp conditions. Consider the specific needs of your hair type - dry, oily, or combination scalps may require different ingredient concentrations. 


### Scent and Texture

The pleasant bergamot aroma should be noticeable but not overpowering. The shampoo's lather should be rich yet gentle, indicating proper surfactant levels. Texture affects application and foaming, with thicker formulas often providing better cleansing power.
