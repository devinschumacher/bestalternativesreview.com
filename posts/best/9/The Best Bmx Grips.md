## Buyer's Guide

BMX grips significantly enhance your bike's ergonomic appeal while improving control and comfort during rides. Whether you're a beginner mastering the basics or an experienced rider pushing your limits, the right grips can make a substantial difference. This guide outlines key factors to consider when selecting BMX grips, helping you find the perfect setup for your riding style and preferences. 


### Material and Construction

BMX grips come in various materials, each offering different levels of durability and grip. Common options include rubber, TPR (thermoplastic rubber), and hybrid combinations. Rubber grips are highly durable and provide excellent vibration absorption, making them popular for rough terrain. TPR grips offer good grip with slightly more flexibility but may not last as long as pure rubber. Hybrid grips combine multiple materials to balance durability and comfort.

### Core Size and Geometry

The core size of grips affects both comfort and control. Larger diameter grips (typically around 31mm to 35mm) provide more padding and reduced hand fatigue, particularly during long rides or intense sessions. Smaller diameter grips (around 27mm to 30mm) offer more responsiveness and direct control but may require frequent replacement due to their softer material. 

Additionally, grip geometry influences hand positioning and comfort. Conical-shaped grips allow for a more natural hand position, improving blood flow and reducing pressure points. Straight bar grips are more common but may cause discomfort during extended use. Consider whether you prefer a straight bar or conical shape based on your riding style and personal comfort preferences. 


### Texture and Traction

Hand grip texture plays a crucial role in maintaining control, especially during technical riding or when hands get sweaty. Triangular-shaped grips with raised sides provide excellent grip while preventing slippage. Textured patterns on the grip surface, such as horizontal ridges or knurls, increase grip while allowing for easy rotation. 

Consider the specific demands of your riding style when choosing texture. Trail riders may prefer aggressive patterns for maximum traction, while park riders might opt for smoother surfaces to maintain precise control during technical maneuvers.

### Installation and Compatibility

Correct installation is essential for both grip functionality and safety. Standard BMX grips use a 10mm bar diameter, but some modern setups require larger 12mm diameter bars. Always verify your bike's bar size before purchasing new grips. 

When mounting grips, ensure they sit flush with the bar and do not protrude excessively. Proper installation typically requires specialized tools, such as grip expanders or specialized wrenches. Following manufacturer instructions carefully helps prevent damaging the grips or your bike's frame during installation. 


## FAQ

![Bmx-Grips-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Bmx-Grips-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are BMX grips?

BMX grips are specialized handlebar grips specifically designed for BMX bikes. These grips offer enhanced grip, improved ergonomics, and often include features like padding for protection during tricks and stunts. 

Standard measurements for BMX grips include a diameter of 22mm and a standard length of 245mm, though specialized sizes may vary. 


### Why choose BMX specific grips?

Bike-specific grips like BMX ones are optimized for specific riding styles and requirements. BMX grips often feature thicker padding and specialized patterns for better grip during technical maneuvers and tricks. 

Using grips designed for your specific bike often results in greater comfort, improved performance, and reduced risk of handlebar-related injuries. 

![Bmx-Grips-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Bmx-Grips-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do I measure for BMX grips?

To measure for BMX grips, find the grip diameter on your bike's handlebars. BMX grips typically have a 22mm diameter, but check your specific bike to ensure compatibility. 

Measure the length, usually between 240mm and 250mm, from the center of the grip where it meets the handlebar. This ensures you get grips that wrap entirely around your hands. 


### What materials are BMX grips made from?

BMX grips are commonly made from dual-durometer compounds. The outer layer provides grip and durability, while the inner layer offers padding and comfort during rides and tricks. 

Some grips feature Kevlar reinforcement in the core for extra durability, preventing bar tape indentations and increasing lifespan. 

![Bmx-Grips-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Bmx-Grips-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How long do BMX grips typically last?

BMX grips usually maintain their performance for 6-12 months with regular use, depending on riding frequency and conditions. Factors affecting grip longevity include exposure to UV light, frequent maintenance, and whether they're used for street, tricks, or trail riding. 

Signs indicating it's time to replace grips include faded graphics, loss of grip due to wear, or visible damage from impacts or crashes. 


### Can I use MTB grips on BMX bikes?

While MTB grips will certainly fit a BMX bike, they may not provide optimal performance. MTB grips typically have a 23mm diameter, which is slightly larger than BMX-specific grips and may not wrap as cleanly around the bars. 

BMX grips are engineered with specific patterns and padding for the sport's demands. Using MTB grips might reduce comfort and affect your control, particularly during technical maneuvers.
