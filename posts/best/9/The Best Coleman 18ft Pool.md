## Buyer's Guide

Coleman is one of the most popular names in portable pools, and their 18-foot models offer a great balance of size and portability. This guide will help you understand the key features to consider when choosing an 18-foot Coleman pool. 


### Size and Space

While 18 feet sounds spacious, you need to consider the pool's footprint and how it will fit in your yard. The overall space required for setup is significantly larger than the water volume. Factor in factors like access routes for inflation and repair equipment, and ensure your location has enough sunlight for proper heating and sanitization.

### Material and Durability

Coleman pools use polyethylene construction, which is lightweight and inexpensive. Top-quality models feature heavier gauge material and reinforced seams for longevity. Consider the pool's wall height - taller walls provide more stability and reduce water turnover, important for maintaining temperature and clarity. 


### Setup and Maintenance

18-foot pools typically require inflation with a dedicated pump, though some models offer built-in blowers for easier setup. Consider the ease of site preparation - do you need to level the ground, or can you set it up on grass? Regular maintenance includes weekly chemical treatments, vacuuming, and checking for leaks - know which tasks you're comfortable performing.

Look for models with built-in steps or ladders for safe entry. Some include portable covers for protection when not in use, but these can be heavy and cumbersome. Consider the pool's compatibility with heating systems and additional equipment like lights or fountains that can enhance your swimming experience.
