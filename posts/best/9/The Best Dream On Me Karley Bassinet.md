## Buyer's Guide

A bassinet like the Dream On Me Karley offers a cozy sleeping solution for your newborn, but what features should you consider before selecting one? From size and portability to safety standards and comfort options, we'll help you find the right bassinet for your family. 


### Safety Standards

Always choose a bassinet that meets current safety standards. Look for models with firm, flat bases and adjustable position options that keep your baby's head from dangling. The crib should have a firm mattress that fits snugly without gaps, and all parts should be smooth without sharp edges. 


### Size and Space Considerations

While bassinets typically measure around 28-30 inches long and 16-18 inches wide, think about where you'll place it. Hallways, doorways, and available storage space can impact your choice. Consider models with compact designs when space is limited. 


### Portability and Setup

Bassinets with detachable mattresses and sturdy frames are easier to move between rooms or store away. Some models feature one-touch setup systems that deploy the mattress and canopy quickly. Weigh convenience during setup against your storage needs. 


### Comfort Features

Browse models with built-in vibrations, music, or soothe modes to help your baby fall asleep. The mattress should be firm with a breathable cover suitable for your baby's age. Consider bassinets with multiple height positions to adapt as your child grows.
