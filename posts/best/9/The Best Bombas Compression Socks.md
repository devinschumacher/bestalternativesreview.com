## Buyer's Guide

Bombas compression socks combine therapeutic pressure with everyday comfort, making them a popular choice for traveling, standing jobs, and recovery. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the right pair for your needs. 


### Purpose and Pressure Level

Compression socks apply graduated pressure from the ankle to the calf, promoting healthy blood flow and reducing swelling. Different compression levels (15-20 mmHg, 20-30 mmHg) suit various needs. Lighter compression is ideal for travel or general comfort, while higher levels support medical conditions like edema or varicose veins.

### Material and Construction

The blend of materials affects both comfort and durability. Medical-grade materials like spandex and cotton provide the necessary compression while maintaining breathability. Higher-quality construction, such as reinforced stitching and cushioned toes, extends the lifespan of the socks and prevents wear. 


### Care and Maintenance

Proper care ensures the longevity of your compression socks and maintains their effectiveness. Most pairs require washing with mild detergent and cold water, followed by air drying rather than using a dryer. Regular inspection for signs of wear, such as loose stitching or thinning elastic, helps identify when replacement is needed.

### Size and Fit

Accurate sizing is crucial for optimal compression and comfort. Measure your ankles and calves to the nearest 1/8 inch, as sock sizes can vary between manufacturers. Proper fit ensures the sock stays in place without sliding down, while allowing for the recommended 1-2 inches of give above the heel. 


## FAQ

![Bombas-Compression-Socks-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Bombas-Compression-Socks-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are Bombas compression socks made of?

Bomba's compression socks are constructed from a blend of materials designed to enhance circulation and reduce swelling. The primary components include a moisture-wicking fabric layer that keeps your feet dry, followed by a compression layer that applies graduated pressure from the ankle to the calf. The outer layer is typically made from a durable polyester blend that resists wear and tear. 

The compression socks are available in both crew and knee-high styles, with compression levels ranging from 15-20 mmHg for mild support to 20-30 mmHg for more intense therapy. Each pair is constructed with reinforced stitching at the heels and toes to prevent wear and maintain shape. 


### How long do Bombas compression socks last?

Bomba's compression socks are built to last through regular use, with each pair offering approximately 6-12 months of wear depending on usage frequency and care. The durability of the socks is influenced by factors such as daily wear time, movement intensity, and care practices. 

For optimal longevity, it's recommended to hand wash the socks in cold water using mild detergent, avoiding the use of fabric softeners and bleach. The socks should be air-dried flat to prevent stretching and maintain their shape. 

![Bombas-Compression-Socks-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Bombas-Compression-Socks-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Are Bombas compression socks machine washable?

While Bomba's compression socks are machine washable, they perform best when hand washed. Machine washing can lead to snagging and reduced elasticity over time. If you choose to use a washing machine, select a gentle cycle and avoid using fabric softeners or bleach, as these can damage the compression properties of the socks. 

Hand washing allows for more control over the cleaning process and helps maintain the integrity of the compression material. After washing, the socks should be air-dried flat rather than being placed in the dryer to prevent stretching and maintain their shape. 


### Can I wear Bombas compression socks every day?

Yes, Bomba's compression socks are intended for daily wear and can be worn every day if they fit properly and feel comfortable. The graduated compression helps improve circulation and reduce swelling, making them beneficial for daily use. 

However, it's important to listen to your body and give your feet a break if you experience any discomfort or if the socks feel too tight. Proper fit is crucial, so if you notice any changes in your feet size or shape, consider retaking your measurements to ensure the best fit.

### How do I measure for Bombas compression socks?

To measure for Bomba's compression socks, start by measuring the circumference of your ankle and calf at their thickest points. For ankle circumference, measure around the widest part of your ankle, usually just above your ankle bones. For calf circumference, measure around the thickest part of your calf while standing with your legs slightly bent. 

Once you have these measurements, refer to Bomba's size chart to determine your correct size. The chart typically lists different sock styles and their recommended measurements, helping you select the most appropriate fit. 


### Are Bombas compression socks suitable for all foot types?

Bomba's compression socks are designed to accommodate various foot sizes and shapes, making them suitable for most people. The socks are available in different lengths (crew and knee-high) and styles, allowing you to choose the most comfortable option for your specific needs. 

If you have any concerns about specific foot conditions or medical needs, it's advisable to consult with a healthcare provider before beginning a compression therapy regimen. They can provide guidance on the appropriate level of compression and help ensure you select the right product for your individual circumstances.
