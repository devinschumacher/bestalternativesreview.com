## Buyer's Guide

The Ruger GP100 is a popular single-action pistol known for its precision and reliability. When selecting a holster, it's important to consider several key factors to ensure proper retention, comfortable carry, and quick draw capabilities. 


### Retention Mechanism

Choose a holster with a secure retention mechanism that prevents accidental discharge while allowing for quick access. Positive click-lock retention or dual-lock systems provide reliable holsters for the GP100's cylindrical magazines.

### Materials and Construction

Quality holsters use durable materials like premium leather or Kydex. Premium leather offers natural break-in and conforming properties, while Kydex provides rock-solid retention and easy cleaning. The holster should feature reinforced stitching or welded construction at stress points. 


### Carry Position

Consider where you'll carry the holster based on your belt type and clothing style. Inside the waistband (IWB) holsters work well under dress pants, while outside the waistband (OWB) styles are better for casual wear or belt-less situations.

### Size Compatibility

Ensure the holster is specifically designed for the GP100, as the firearm's shape requires precise fit. The holster should have dedicated slots for both the frame and magazine to prevent rotation during draw.
