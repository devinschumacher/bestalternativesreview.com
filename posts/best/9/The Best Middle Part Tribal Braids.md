### What are the key features of a middle part tribal braid?

Middle part tribal braids combine traditional braiding techniques with modern styling options. These braids typically feature sections of hair twisted into intricate patterns and styled with bold, decorative elements such as beads, feathers, or leather strips. 

The braiding technique can vary - some styles involve double braids while others incorporate fishtail or Dutch braids. The middle part adds visual interest and allows for longer finished braids compared to styles with side parts. 


### How long do middle part tribal braids last?

Middle part tribal braids can last anywhere from 2-4 weeks with proper care. The longevity depends on factors like how often you wash your hair, your hair type (thicker hair tends to hold braids longer), and how often you style the braids. 

To extend the life of your braids, avoid sleeping on a regular pillowcase as hair oils can break down the strands. Regular daily care such as spritzing with braid-specific care products can help maintain their shape and integrity. 

![Middle-Part-Tribal-Braids-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Middle-Part-Tribal-Braids-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Are middle part tribal braids suitable for all hair types?

Middle part tribal braids are suitable for most hair types, including fine, medium, and thick hair. They work particularly well with straight to wavy hair types. Curly hair may require special techniques to maintain the braids correctly. 

Before getting your hair done, consider whether your hair is prone to breakage. Very fine or straight hair that breaks easily might not hold braids as well as other styles. 


### How much time does it take to maintain middle part tribal braids?

Maintaining middle part tribal braids requires regular upkeep, including daily spritzing with braid-specific products, weekly washing, and touch-ups to prevent tangling and maintain the braid's integrity. 

Touch-ups may be needed every 2-3 days to maintain the braids' shape and prevent fraying. The complete maintenance process typically takes 15-30 minutes per week, plus the initial 2-3 hours of styling time. 

![Middle-Part-Tribal-Braids-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Middle-Part-Tribal-Braids-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can middle part tribal braids be worn on shorter hair?

Middle part tribal braids are suitable for hair lengths as short as 2 inches. If your hair is shorter, the braids may look more minimalist with fewer sections and simpler patterns. 

For very short hair, a middle part braid can be achieved using small braids or French twists close to the scalp. Hair length between 2-4 inches allows for more intricate patterns and sections. 


### What are the potential drawbacks of middle part tribal braids?

Middle part tribal braids can be time-consuming to maintain, requiring daily care and weekly washing. Hair may become dry or brittle from the styling products needed to keep the braids in place. 

Long-term braiding can cause hair breakage and tension, particularly in areas where the braid meets the scalp. Proper technique and regular rest periods between braiding sessions can help prevent these issues.
