## Buyer's Guide

When selecting a Yeti cooler with wheels, several factors will influence your choice, including capacity, insulation quality, material durability, and wheel system. Understanding these aspects will help you find a cooler that matches your specific needs for outdoor adventures, tailgating, or beach trips. 


### Cooler Capacity and Dimensions

Begin by determining how much food and ice you need to transport. Yeti coolers are available in various sizes, typically ranging from 15 to 85 quarts. Consider the dimensions as well, as some models with wheels may have deeper profiles that could be challenging to store in tight spaces. 


### Insulation Performance

Yeti coolers are renowned for their exceptional insulation, utilizing thick walls and advanced thermal seals. Look for models with a minimum of 2 inches of foam insulation. Additionally, check if the lid seals properly to prevent cold air loss, as this can significantly impact your cooler's performance.

The wheels, handles, and other accessories should also be robust enough to withstand regular use and occasional drops.

Look for coolers with four wheels that provide stability and smooth rolling, especially on uneven surfaces.
