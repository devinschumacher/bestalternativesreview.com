These black side-tie bikini bottoms pair a flattering, slightly fitted shape with custom gold charms at the sides. They're made for a fuller figure with adjustable sides that keep them in place while giving you lovely curve-hugging coverage.

Reviewers especially love how well they sit on the waist and the flattering way they accentuate curves without squeezing.

## Buyer's Guide

The right bikini camel toe design can enhance your swimsuit's shape and give you more confidence in the water. Understanding the different styles and considerations can help you make an informed choice. 


### Camel Toe Styles

Common designs include triangle, inverted triangle, and high-low cut. Triangle styles offer more coverage while still creating the camel toe effect. Inverted triangles and high-low cuts provide more visual interest but require precise measurements for optimal fit. 


### Key Measurement Considerations

Take accurate measurements of your natural waist and hip circumference. The ideal suit size should have measurements 1-2 inches smaller than your natural measurements for a tailored fit. Consider your body type when selecting the right cut and waist measurement. 


### Bikini Construction Materials

Common fabrics include nylon and spandex blends, with varying degrees of stretch and durability. Higher-quality suits made from 80-90% nylon provide better shape retention and resistance to chlorine damage. Check the inner lining material for comfort against your skin. 


### Care and Maintenance

Follow the care instructions for your specific suit material. Most bikinis made from nylon and spandex blends can be machine washed in cold water with mild detergent. Avoid using bleach or harsh chemicals. Air dry your swimsuit flat to maintain its shape and prevent stretching. 


## FAQ


### What is a bikini camel toe?

A bikini camel toe occurs when the top of the foot becomes visible through the crotch of a bikini, giving the appearance of a "camel's toe. " This can happen when the swimsuit is too small, poorly fitted, or when the wearer has naturally longer legs or shorter torso. 

To minimize camel toe, look for bikinis with higher legs or built-in tummy control. Wearing thong-style bikinis can also help prevent this issue, as they provide more coverage in the crotch area. 


### How can I choose the right bikini size?

Measure your bust, waist, and hips to find your true size. Consider getting a size larger if you prefer a looser fit or if you have a fuller bust. The underband should sit comfortably under your bust without digging in, while the sides should fit snugly but allow for about two fingers' width between the band and your body. 

Try on bikinis with different styles to see what shape and silhouette work best for your body type. Pay attention to how the fabric moves with your body – it should stretch and flex without pulling or bunching up. 


### What materials are best for preventing camel toe?

Nylon-based fabrics like Spandex offer excellent stretch and recovery, making them ideal for preventing camel toe. Higher percentages of Spandex in the material provide better flexibility and conformity to your body shape. 

Wearing a second layer like tights or a body stocking under your bikini can help prevent visibility at the crotch, especially during stretching or water activities. Choose seamless options to avoid additional irritation. 


### Can camel toe be prevented with proper posture?

While proper posture can affect how much of your foot becomes visible, it's largely dependent on your body shape and the way you carry your weight. Maintaining good posture prevents unnecessary stress on your lower back and pelvis, which can affect your alignment. 

Focus on core strengthening exercises to improve your posture and overall body awareness in and out of the water. This can help maintain proper alignment and reduce the likelihood of camel toe appearing. 


### What should I consider if I have a shorter torso?

A shorter torso can increase the risk of camel toe, so look for bikinis with higher legs that extend further up the thighs. Opt for styles with built-in tummy control or consider a separate midsection binder if necessary. 

Consider wearing a bikini top with a longer back closure to prevent the top from riding up and revealing more of your midsection. This can help balance your overall silhouette and reduce the appearance of camel toe. 


### How can I maintain my bikini for daily wear?

After each use, rinse your bikini with cool water to remove chlorine and saltwater residue. Hang it to air dry rather than putting it in the dryer, which can cause shrinking and distortion. 

Store your bikinis in a dry place away from direct sunlight and heat sources. Consider using a breathable mesh bag or a garment bag to prevent tangling and protect your swimsuit from damage.
