## Buyer's Guide

The Lee Cargo Shorts combine style, functionality, and durability in a versatile summer essential. These shorts are designed for active lifestyles, offering multiple pockets and moisture-wicking properties while maintaining a comfortable, breathable feel. 


### Key Features

Quality construction and premium materials distinguish high-performing cargo shorts. Look for reinforced stitching, durable water-repellent (DWR) coatings, and reinforced stitching at stress points like the knees and pockets. 

Additions like moisture-wicking fabrics, UPF protection, and antimicrobial treatments enhance comfort and hygiene. Padded seats and articulated knees improve ride quality for cycling or motorcycling applications. 


### Pocket Options

Multiple pockets provide storage for essentials, with secure zipper closures and deep storage capacities preferred. Consider variations like external pockets for quick-access items, inner pockets for smaller items, and specific organizer pockets for phones or wallets. 

Padding in the seat and thigh areas increases comfort during extended wear, while stretch panels in the thigh and knee zones enhance flexibility and prevent bunching. 


### Fit and sizing

Cargo shorts come in various lengths and fits, from slim to relaxed styles. The right fit balances movement freedom with compression. Most styles offer adjustable waistbands and multiple belt loops for customization. 

Consider the specific body measurements that affect fit, including waist circumference, hip measurements, and thigh sizes. Some brands provide detailed sizing charts based on these measurements. 


### Maintenance and care

Proper care extends the life of cargo shorts and maintains their performance. Most styles require machine washing in cold water with mild detergents, though some may need hand washing or specialized cleaning for certain materials. 

Air drying is recommended to prevent shrinkage and maintain fabric integrity, with direct sunlight exposure avoided to preserve color and materials. Some brands offer specific care instructions based on material composition.
