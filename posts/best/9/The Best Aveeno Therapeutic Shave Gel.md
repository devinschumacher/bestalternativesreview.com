Its mild formula makes it ideal for daily use, though it's especially effective when used before shaving.

### How should I apply Aveeno Therapeutic Shave Gel?

Apply a generous amount of the gel to your skin, working it into a rich lather with a shaving brush if possible. The lather helps to soften the hair and protect the skin during the shaving process. 

It's best to apply the gel to slightly moist skin, allowing it to work for a few minutes before shaving to maximize its protective properties. 


### How long does a tube of Aveeno Therapeutic Shave Gel last?

A standard 8oz tube typically lasts between 1-2 months, depending on daily use and application amount. 

Users should replace the tube when the formula appears cloudy or has sediment at the bottom, indicating potential contamination.

### Are there different variants of Aveeno Therapeutic Shave Gel?

The primary variant is the Therapeutic Shave Gel, featuring the classic formula with oatmeal and salicylic acid. 

For those who prefer a scent, there's a Tea Tree Antiseptic Shave Gel available, which includes the same protective ingredients with an added tea tree oil scent. 


### Can I use Aveeno Therapeutic Shave Gel as a facial cleanser?

The gel is specifically designed for shaving and exfoliation, not as a general facial cleanser. Its abrasive properties may be too harsh for regular cleansing. 

For everyday cleansing, Aveeno recommends using their Hydrating Facial Wash instead.
