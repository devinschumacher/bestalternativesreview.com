## Buyer's Guide

When selecting a Dewalt cordless vacuum, several key factors determine its suitability for various cleaning tasks. Understanding these aspects helps in choosing a tool that matches your needs while providing reliable performance. 


### Power Source and Runtime

Most Dewalt cordless vacuums use Li-ion batteries that need regular charging. Choose a model with sufficient runtime for your cleaning area size. Performance typically degrades with each cycle, so consider how often you'll need to recharge between uses.

### Tool Compatibility and Accessories

Dewalt vacuums often integrate with their tool ecosystem, allowing quick attachment of various components. Essential attachments include crevice tools and dusting brushes for hard-to-reach areas. The variety and quality of included accessories impact overall cleaning effectiveness. 


### Battery Charging and Storage

Look for a vacuum with efficient charging technology and a good storage system for spare batteries. Extended storage of fully charged batteries should be avoided due to capacity loss. Proper battery maintenance extends the tool's lifespan and performance consistency.

Lighter vacuums improve maneuverability, especially for frequent use. Check if the model balances well and has comfortable grip points. Anti-vibration features can reduce hand fatigue during extended cleaning sessions.

### What's the runtime of Dewalt cordless vacuums?

The runtime of Dewalt cordless vacuums varies by model and battery type. Basic models with a single 18V battery typically offer 30-60 minutes of runtime, while premium models with dual 18V batteries can last up to 120 minutes under optimal conditions. 

Runtime is affected by factors such as battery quality, usage intensity, and ambient temperature. For best results, refer to the specific model's documentation for accurate runtime estimates. 


### How long does it take to charge Dewalt cordless vacuums?

Dewalt vacuums usually require 3-4 hours to fully charge a single 18V battery pack. This time can vary based on the specific model and whether the battery is partially or fully discharged. 

For efficient battery management, consider purchasing an additional battery pack if your model supports it. This allows for continued cleaning while the battery charges, without interrupting your cleaning session.

Attachment compatibility varies by model. Always check your vacuum's specifications to ensure the attachments will work with your specific unit. 


### How do I maintain Dewalt cordless vacuum batteries?

To extend battery life, store Dewalt batteries fully charged in a cool, dry place. Avoid complete discharge (below 20% capacity) whenever possible, as this can lead to reduced runtime and eventual loss of capacity. 

Regularly clean the battery terminals with a soft cloth to remove dust and debris. This helps maintain optimal electrical contact and ensures reliable charging.

Heavier models, especially those with dual battery packs, can weigh between 6 and 8 pounds. For users who need to carry their vacuum frequently, consider models with lighter battery configurations or manual carrying handles. 


### Are Dewalt cordless vacuums suitable for pet hair?

Many Dewalt cordless vacuums feature specific attachments and filters designed for pet hair removal, making them suitable for pet owners. Models with motorized brushes or specialized pet hair tools can effectively remove even the finest pet hair and dander from carpets and fabrics. 

Regular maintenance, including timely emptying of the collection bag or canister and timely replacement of filters, is crucial for maintaining optimal pet hair removal performance.
