## FAQ

![Coterie-Diapers-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Coterie-Diapers-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What makes Coterie Diapers different from other brands?

Coterie Diapers features premium bamboo-based materials that offer exceptional moisture-wicking and softness, making them less irritating than traditional cotton alternatives. The bamboo component also provides natural antifungal properties that help prevent diaper rash. 

These diapers incorporate a 3D flexible waistband and adjustable legs that enhance comfort while maintaining a slim fit, unlike some bulky, less flexible diaper designs. 


### Do Coterie Diapers come with a money-back guarantee?

Yes, Coterie offers a risk-free 60-day satisfaction guarantee. If you're not completely satisfied with your purchase, you can return the diapers for a full refund. 

This policy reflects their confidence in the product's quality and demonstrates their commitment to customer satisfaction. 

![Coterie-Diapers-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Coterie-Diapers-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do Coterie Diapers compare in terms of length options?

The diapers come in five length options: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, which cover a range of infant sizes from birth to 35 pounds. This comprehensive sizing addresses the varying growth stages of babies. 

Each size is clearly marked with an age range and weight guideline to help parents choose the most appropriate option for their child. 


### What are the environmental benefits of bamboo-based diapers?

Bamboo is a rapidly renewable resource and requires less water and pesticides than materials used in conventional cotton diapers. This sustainable choice helps reduce environmental impact while providing excellent diaper performance. 

Compostable packaging reduces waste, and bamboo fabrics decompose more readily than conventional plastics, making Coterie Diapers a more eco-friendly option. 

![Coterie-Diapers-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Coterie-Diapers-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do the bamboo materials measure up to regular cotton diapers?

Bamboo-based materials in Coterie Diapers offer superior moisture absorption and breathability compared to cotton. The natural moisture barrier properties of bamboo help maintain drier, more comfortable skin for the baby. 

While some cotton diapers may contain moisture-wicking lining, bamboo's inherent properties provide natural moisture control without additional layers. 


### Can parents mix and match Coterie Diapers with other brands?

Mixing and matching Coterie Diapers with other brands is generally safe, but it's important to ensure the compatibility of size and fit standards between brands. Proper fit is crucial for preventing leaks and maintaining hygiene. 

For the best results, consider using diapers from the same brand's size chart, as slight differences in fit standards can affect performance and comfort.
