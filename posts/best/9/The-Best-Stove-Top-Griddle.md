## Buyer's Guide

A stove top griddle combines generous cooking space with versatile heat distribution, perfect for both everyday cooking and special occasions. This guide highlights key features to consider when selecting the right griddle for your kitchen. 


### Size and Space Requirements

Stove top griddles range from 12 to 24 inches in diameter. Consider the available counter space and cooktop clearance when choosing your griddle's size. For larger families or frequent entertaining, a griddle measuring 18 inches or more provides ample cooking surface. 


### Heat Settings and Controls

Look for griddles with at least two heat settings - low and high - to accommodate different cooking tasks. Some models feature precise temperature control with multiple settings, while others have only basic high/low options. Check if the heat control knob is oven mitt-friendly to prevent burns during use. 


### Non-Stick Coating

Most stove top griddles are coated with non-stick material to prevent food from sticking. PFOA-free ceramic coatings are becoming increasingly common and provide excellent release properties without harmful chemicals. Consider the brand's reputation for coating durability, as some less expensive options may wear off more quickly. 


### Material and Build Quality

Stove top griddles are typically made from aluminum, cast iron, or stainless steel. Aluminum griddles are lightweight and affordable but may warp over time with frequent use. Cast iron griddles distribute heat evenly and maintain temperature well but require regular seasoning to prevent rust. Stainless steel griddles offer the best durability and ease of cleaning but are the most expensive option. 


## FAQ


### What is a stove top griddle?

A stove top griddle is a flat cooking surface with raised edges that sits directly on a stove burner. Unlike traditional skillets, griddles have a larger cooking area and can handle multiple cooking tasks simultaneously. 

These versatile cookware pieces are ideal for making pancakes, bacon, eggs, and other breakfast items. They're also great for cooking vegetables, making sandwiches, and grilling small pieces of meat. 


### What are the main benefits of using a stove top griddle?

Stove top griddles maximize cooking space and efficiency, allowing you to cook multiple foods simultaneously. Their raised edges help contain foods and prevent spillage. 

These cookware pieces typically have superior heat retention, ensuring consistent cooking temperatures. They're also versatile enough for both breakfast and lunchtime cooking, making them a valuable addition to any kitchen. 


### What materials are stove top griddles made from?

Stove top griddles are available in various materials, including aluminum, stainless steel, cast iron, and non-stick coated surfaces. Aluminum and stainless steel models are lightweight and easy to clean, while cast iron griddles develop a natural seasoning and excellent heat retention. 

Non-stick coated griddles provide easy food release and are dishwasher-safe, making them convenient for everyday use. The material you choose depends on your cooking preferences and maintenance requirements. 


### How do I properly care for a stove top griddle?

For cast iron and carbon steel griddles, clean with soapy water and dry thoroughly after each use. Season cast iron regularly with vegetable oil to prevent rust and maintain non-stick properties. 

Stainless steel and aluminum griddles can typically be cleaned with soap and water or placed in the dishwasher. Non-stick griddles should be cleaned with mild detergent and a soft sponge to maintain their cooking surface. 


### What size stove top griddle do I need?

Most stove top griddles come in three common sizes: 8-inch, 10-inch, and 12-inch. An 8-inch griddle is suitable for single servings or small breakfasts, while 10-inch and 12-inch models provide more cooking space for larger families or professional cooking. 

Consider the number of people you'll be cooking for and the types of foods you plan to prepare. A 12-inch griddle offers the most versatility for multiple dishes and larger portions. 


### How do I prevent foods from sticking to the griddle?

For cast iron and carbon steel griddles, ensure the cooking surface is completely dry before use and apply a thin layer of oil. This preheated, oiled surface creates a natural non-stick barrier. 

For non-stick griddles, use spatulas or turners with smooth edges to prevent scratching the cooking surface. Avoid using metal utensils on non-stick griddles, as they can damage the coating.
