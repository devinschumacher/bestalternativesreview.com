## Buyer's Guide

The Calpak luggage collection offers a variety of options for both domestic and international travel. Understanding the key features and considerations can help you select the most suitable bag for your needs. 


### Selecting the Right Size

Calpak luggage sizes vary from carry-on to oversized options, so it's important to choose a bag that matches your destination requirements. Check airline policies for specific carry-on dimensions and weight limits. For checked bags, consider the cubic footage of your destination's baggage claim area to ensure you can retrieve your luggage.

### Material Durability

The quality of materials significantly impacts luggage longevity. Look for bags constructed with hard-shell polycarbonate or ABS, which resist scratches and dents better than soft-sided alternatives. Check the material's resistance to scratches and fading in direct sunlight. 


### Wheel System

Calpak luggage often features enhanced rolling systems for easier mobility. Four-wheel designs offer greater stability, while three-wheel configurations are more compact. The wheel quality affects smoothness, with ball-bearing wheels generally providing better performance than standard wheels.
