### What types of Xbox rechargeable batteries are available?

Microsoft offers both wall charger kits with batteries and spare batteries for their gaming devices. Wall charger kits include one AA battery and a wall charger, while spare batteries come in packs of three AAA batteries. 

The batteries are specifically designed for modern Xbox gaming devices and are compatible with the Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and backward compatible with older models. 


### How long do Xbox rechargeable batteries last?

Microsoft's wall charger kits deliver a charge at 200 milliamp, providing approximately 1.5 hours of power per AAA battery. Full charges typically take 4.5 hours. 

Spare batteries maintain their charge for 18 months when properly stored. Under normal gaming use (2 AA or 3 AAA batteries), a wall charger kit's battery provides about 30 hours of gameplay.

### What's the best way to store Xbox rechargeable batteries?

Store spare batteries in a cool, dry place between uses. Charge them monthly to maintain optimal performance, especially when not in use for extended periods. 

Avoid mixing new and old batteries, as well as different brands and chemistries, in the same device to prevent shortened runtime and potential safety hazards. 


### How do I tell if an Xbox battery needs replacing?

Batteries should be replaced if they consistently deliver less than 2 hours of gameplay, show signs of swelling or damage, or fail to hold a charge after full cycles. If you notice flickering lights or inconsistent performance in your gaming device, battery replacement may be needed. 

Check the battery's voltage with a multimeter if you suspect degraded performance. A healthy AAA battery should read around 1.2V, while AA batteries should measure around 1.35V when fully charged.

### Can I use external chargers with Xbox batteries?

Microsoft batteries are designed for specific wall chargers included with their devices. Using unauthorized chargers may damage the battery or device and is not covered under warranty. 

For spare batteries, use the included wall charger kit. If you need additional charging solutions, contact Microsoft support for officially sanctioned charging options. 


### What's the warranty coverage for Xbox batteries?

Batteries covered under the Xbox 1-year warranty typically include those included with new purchases or purchased separately from Microsoft's official store. Damaged batteries received within this period are usually replaced free of charge.
