## Buyer's Guide

Choosing the right griddle can significantly impact your cooking experience, especially when using premium cookware like All Clad. This guide will help you understand the key features and considerations for selecting an All Clad griddle that matches your cooking needs and style. 


### Size and Surface Area

Most All Clad griddles range from 12 to 14 inches in diameter, providing ample cooking space for most home cook needs. Consider the amount of food you typically cook at once. If you're entertaining or cooking for larger groups, a full-size 14-inch griddle may be more practical.

### Material and Construction

All Clad griddles are known for their durable construction, combining aluminum with stainless steel layers for even heat distribution. The thickness of these layers affects heat retention and cooking performance. For optimal results, choose a griddle with generous aluminum core thickness. 


### Non-Stick Coating

All Clad griddles come with either their signature Verrelude non-stick coating or a premium PFOA-free coating. The Verlude coating offers excellent release properties and durability, making it suitable for both cooking and baking. If you prefer a PFOA-free option, check if the coating maintains its performance under high heat.

### Handle and Temperature Rating

The handle material and temperature rating are crucial for safe handling, especially when using cooking oils that smoke at lower temperatures. All Clad griddles feature oven-safe handles rated up to 450Â°F. Consider whether you need the convenience of a removable handle or prefer a fixed design for stability.

### How do I properly care for an All Clad griddle?

Hand wash the griddle with mild soap and warm water immediately after use to prevent food residue from setting. Avoid using abrasive pads or harsh cleaners that could scratch the cookware's surface. For thorough cleaning, you can soak the griddle in warm, soapy water for 10-15 minutes before scrubbing.

The cookware's longevity is influenced by regular cleaning, proper storage, and occasional reseasoning. Following these care instructions helps extend the griddle's lifespan and ensures consistent cooking performance. 


### Are All Clad griddles oven-safe?

Yes, All Clad griddles are oven-safe up to 400Â°F (204Â°C). The cookware piece can be used in the oven for tasks like re-heating or baking items that require even heat distribution. Always remove the griddle from the oven using oven mitts to prevent burns.
