## Buyer's Guide

A Ridgid leaf blower is a powerful tool for residential and light commercial leaf management. When selecting a Ridgid leaf blower, consider key factors to find the right equipment for your needs. 


### Performance and Power

Ridgid leaf blowers vary in power, measured in horsepower (HP) or cubic feet per minute (CFM). Higher CFM ratings indicate stronger airflow, ideal for dense leaf piles. For most residential use, 60-80 CFM is sufficient. Consider whether you need the blower for single-tree cleanup or complete yard coverage.

### Size and Portability

Ridgid offers both backpack and push-start models. Backpack blowers provide unrestricted movement but require more physical exertion. Push-start models are often heavier but typically offer longer operational times between starts. Consider your physical condition and how often you plan to move the equipment around your property. 


### Attachments and Versatility

Multifunctional blowers allow conversion between leaf blowing and vacuuming modes, reducing equipment needs. Consider whether you want attachments like side inlets for efficient debris collection or an adjustable nozzle for targeted blowing. The versatility can be especially valuable in uneven terrain or when cleaning multiple surfaces.

Ridgid leaf blowers are known for their durability, but regular maintenance prevents premature failure. Look for blowers with accessible air filters, replaceable parts, and robust construction materials like heavy-duty rubber handles and reinforced casings. The cost of maintenance supplies should also factor into your overall budget.
