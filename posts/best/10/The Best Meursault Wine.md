This full-bodied Meursault Premier Cru exudes rich yellow fruit flavors, particularly fresh apricot, with a generous mouthfeel that's less minerally than some of its neighbors in the vineyard.

From the uppermost position in Meursault's vineyards, this wine delivers a fresh, mineral-driven profile with pronounced citrus characteristics, particularly lemon, complemented by green and white floral notes.

This Louis Latour Meursault spends 8-10 months in French oak barrels before hitting your glass. The result is a creamy white that shows off yellow fruit and brioche notes, with hints of almond and vanilla finishing with a crisp mineral edge. If you're pairing this with food, think prawn cocktails, grilled sea bass, or that rich veal cream sauce - it's built for bringing out the best in dairy and seafood. The winery's commitment to sustainability shines through in their composting system and horse-drawn plowing, making this more than just a great drink, but a slice of responsible French viticulture.

## Buyer's Guide

Meursault wine, hailing from the Côte de Powell region of Burgundy, France, is a renowned vin de france that speaks of its terroir through every glass. Choosing the right Meursault involves understanding its distinct characteristics and the nuances that set it apart from other Chardonnays. Here's what you need to consider when selecting your Meursault. 


### Terrain and Soil

Meursault benefits from a unique combination of soil types including yellow limestone and marl, which influence its mineral intensity and textural complexity. Look for wines that highlight these geological aspects, as they contribute to the Meursault's signature personality. Winemakers who prioritize minimal intervention and preserve the vineyard's natural elements typically produce the most authentic expressions of Meursault. 

![Meursault-Wine-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Meursault-Wine-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Vineyard Age and Origin

The age and specific location of the vines significantly impact the wine's character. Grand Cru and Premier Cru bottlings, which come from older vines and more elevated sites, generally offer greater depth and complexity. While younger wines (from 7 to 10 years old) may present more primary fruit characteristics, older vintages (15+ years) develop pronounced nutty and biscuit-like aromas that are hallmarks of well-aged Meursault. 


### Bottle Aging Potential

Unlike many Chardonnays, which can lose their freshness after a decade, Meursault often improves with extended cellaring. The wine's natural acidity and lower new oak usage allow it to develop elegant tertiary flavors while maintaining its core fruit character. A properly cellared bottle from a reputable producer can develop remarkable complexity over 20+ years, though younger bottles remain drinking well within 5-10 years of release. 

![Meursault-Wine-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Meursault-Wine-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Style Preferences and Pairing

Meursault presents a spectrum of styles from crisp and unoaked to rich and nutty, depending on vineyard site and winemaking approach. If you enjoy full-bodied Chardonnay, seek out wines from younger vines and Premier Cru levels. For a more classic Meursault experience, look for older vine bottlings or Grand Cru wines, which typically show greater minerality and texture. Pair Meursault with seafood, poultry, or creamy sauces, as its bright acidity and delicate flavors complement these dishes effectively. 


## FAQ

![Meursault-Wine-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Meursault-Wine-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What makes Meursault wine unique?

Meursault wine stands out among Chardonnay-based whites for its extraordinary complexity and depth. The soil's limestone content gives the wine remarkable minerality, while the wine's aging potential rivals that of many reds. Expect layers of nuance in flavors of ripe stone fruits, wet stone, and subtle spice, developing beautifully with age. 

Its distinct character comes from the terroir of the Meursault appellation in the Côte de Beaune region of Burgundy, where traditional winemaking practices preserve the grape's natural elegance and precision. 


### How should Meursault be drunk?

Unlike some white wines that benefit from minimal aging, quality Meursault should be consumed between 7-15 years after harvest. The ideal drinking window depends on the specific vintage and vineyard's characteristics. The wine shows best when served between 15-18°C (60-65°F). 

Food pairing focuses on seafood, especially oysters and white meat preparations like roast chicken or pork. The wine's acidity and mineral notes cut through rich dishes while the fruitiness complements lighter preparations. 

![Meursault-Wine-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Meursault-Wine-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the differences between different Meursault vineyards?

The 1er Cru and Grand Cru vineyards in Meursault produce wines of significantly different quality and character. 1er Crus, though typically more approachable, capture specific terroir characteristics that distinguish them from the appellation average. Grand Cru wines represent the pinnacle of the region's winemaking. 

Vineyards like Saint-Aubin, Praz de Dieu, and Perrieras produce notable 1er Cru wines that showcase distinct minerality and concentration. Grand Cru vineyards like Bressandes and Perrières consistently produce complex, age-worthy wines that develop remarkable depth over time. 


### How should Meursault be stored?

Proper storage requires consistent temperature between 10-14°C (50-57°F), with minimal fluctuation to preserve the wine's structure and freshness. Ideally, bottles should be stored on their sides to keep the cork moist and prevent air from entering the bottle. 

Adequate humidity (60-70%) and protection from vibration are crucial. While professional cellars offer ideal conditions, home storage can be effective with proper climate control and protection from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures. 

![Meursault-Wine-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Meursault-Wine-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the most reputable producers?

The Côte de Beaune region is home to numerous respected producers that consistently deliver high-quality Meursault wines. Domaines like Louis Jadot, Domaine Michel Bouzeron, and Domaine Drouhin have established reputations for producing both accessible and age-worthy Meursault wines. 

Independent producers like Domaine Thierry Pavan and Domaine de la Romanée-Conti's Meursault holdings also merit attention for their distinctive vineyard expressions and traditional winemaking approach. 


### What should I consider when tasting Meursault?

When evaluating Meursault, focus on the wine's texture, acidity, and minerality rather than oak influence, which should be minimal to non-existent. The best wines develop a sense of weight and concentration, with flavors of white peach, lemon zest, and wet stone that build in complexity with air exposure. 

Balance is crucial - look for a harmonious relationship between fruit intensity, acidity, and minerality. The wine should finish long and pure, with lingering notes of stone fruits and subtle spice that reflect the Meursault appellation's distinctive character.
