## Buyer's Guide

A Royal Gourmet Griddle is an versatile kitchen appliance that combines the convenience of a flat top griddle with the functionality of multiple heating zones. This comprehensive guide will help you understand the key features, sizing considerations, and maintenance requirements to find the perfect griddle for your cooking needs. 


### Heating Zones and Temperature Control

The heating zones allow you to cook different foods simultaneously at varying temperatures, ideal for frying eggs while keeping pancakes warm. High-quality griddles feature precise temperature controls ranging from 200° to 450°F (93° to 232°C), with gauges that accurately display and maintain set temperatures. 


### Surface Material and Non-Stick Coating

The griddle surface should be made of durable aluminum with an oxidation-resistant coating, such as stainless steel or porcelain. The non-stick coating should use food-grade materials like ceramic or PTFE (Teflon) that meet FDA standards. Look for griddles with easy-release properties that prevent food sticking while ensuring safe cooking temperatures. 


### Size and Space Considerations

Measure your kitchen counter space before selecting a griddle size. Common dimensions range from 18 inches to 36 inches in width, with some models featuring built-in wheels for mobility. Consider whether you need a single- or double-surfaced griddle, as double-sided models provide more cooking surface but take up twice the space. 


### Maintenance Requirements

Proper maintenance ensures your griddle performs efficiently and lasts longer. After each use, clean the surface with warm water and mild soap, avoiding harsh chemicals that damage the non-stick coating. Regularly check and maintain heating elements and controls according to the manufacturer's instructions. For storage, allow the griddle to air dry completely before covering to prevent moisture buildup.
