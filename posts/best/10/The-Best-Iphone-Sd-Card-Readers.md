## Buyer's Guide

Adding storage to your iPhone can transform your device's capabilities, especially when you need extra space for photos, videos, or apps. SD card readers allow you to expand your iPhone's storage capacity using SD cards, which are more cost-effective than iPhone storage upgrades. Understanding the technical specifications and compatibility requirements will help you choose the right SD card reader for your iPhone. 


### Technical Specifications

SD card readers use different protocols to communicate with iOS devices, and the most common are USB 2.0 and USB 3.0. USB 3.0 readers offer faster data transfer speeds but may require additional power, while USB 2.0 readers are more widely compatible.

### Compatibility and iOS Version Requirements

Some readers may require iOS 14 or later, while others work with earlier versions. Additionally, verify that the reader fully supports your SD card's capacity, as some readers may not recognize cards larger than 128GB. 


### Physical Design and Features

The physical design of an SD card reader affects both functionality and portability. Card slots should be robust enough to prevent damage when inserting SD cards with protective cases. Consider models with built-in USB cables for easier connection, and look for readers that include protective covers to prevent damage when not in use. For travel, choose a slim design with a secure clip or lanyard to attach to your keys or bag.
