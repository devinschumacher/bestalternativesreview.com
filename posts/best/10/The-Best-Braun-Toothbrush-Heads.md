Braun offers multiple head types, including standard, deep clean, and sensitive versions, allowing users to choose based on their specific oral care needs and preferences. 


### How often should I replace my Braun toothbrush head?

Replacement frequency depends on usage, but dental experts recommend replacing Braun toothbrush heads every 3-4 months or when bristles show signs of fraying. 

Braun toothbrushes automatically alert users when it's time to replace the head through a LED display, helping maintain optimal oral hygiene. 


### Are Braun toothbrush heads suitable for all age groups?

Standard Braun toothbrush heads are suitable for most adults and older children who can maintain proper brushing technique. The brush heads are designed to fit standard Braun toothbrush handles. 

The sensitive version of Braun toothbrush heads is recommended for individuals with gum sensitivity, recently undergone dental work, or have specific oral care needs requiring gentler brushing. 


### Can I use any regular toothpaste with Braun toothbrush heads?

Braun toothbrush heads are compatible with most toothpaste brands, including both regular and sensitive formulas. However, it's recommended to use toothpaste specifically designed for use with electric toothbrushes, which can enhance cleaning efficacy.

### How should I store my Braun toothbrush head?

After use, gently rinse the toothbrush head under running water, then shake off excess moisture before replacing the brush head back into the handle. 

For optimal care, store the brush head upright in a toothbrush holder or allow it to air dry with the bristles facing up in an upright position to prevent water accumulation and potential bacterial growth.
