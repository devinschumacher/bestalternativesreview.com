## Buyer's Guide

Odyssey putter grips have gained popularity among golfers for their distinctive texture and proven performance. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the right grip for your putting style and preferences. 


### Surface Texture

Odyssey grips feature a unique diamond-patterned texture designed to enhance grip security during putting. The pattern's depth and consistency affect how firmly the grip adheres to your hand, with deeper grooves providing more grip but potentially less feel. 

![Odyssey-Putter-Grips-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Odyssey-Putter-Grips-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Materials and Construction

Grips are available in three main materials: thermoplastic rubber, urethane, and tacky rubber. Thermoplastic rubber provides a firmer feel, while urethane offers a softer, more premium option. Tacky rubber blends the benefits of both materials. Grip weight and construction impact both feel and performance. 


### Circumference and Shape

Standard grip diameters range from 1.685 inches to 1.75 inches, with 1.685 being the most common. Grip shapes vary from standard cylindrical to slightly curved designs, with some featuring a distinct heel-toe profile. Grip circumference affects how the grip fits around your hands.

### Moisture Resistance

Grips degrade over time due to UV exposure and moisture absorption, affecting their performance and grip quality. Urethane grips generally maintain their shape and texture better than thermoplastic options, especially in wet conditions. Consider this factor based on your climate and playing environment. 


## FAQ

![Odyssey-Putter-Grips-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Odyssey-Putter-Grips-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What makes Odyssey putter grips unique?

Odyssey employs proprietary milling techniques to create highly textured grips that significantly reduce rotation during putting. Their most distinctive feature is the "Daymark" - a raised center mark that aligns with the putter's sweet spot at address. 

Odyssey offers a comprehensive grip lineup including Tour Preferred (TP), Tour Standard (TS), and Tour Select (TSX) models, each with different texture and diameter options to suit individual preferences. 


### How do Odyssey grips compare to competitors?

While competitors like Scotty Cameron and X-O putter grips excel at traditional shaping, Odyssey's milling process produces a more consistent texture across the entire grip surface. Their raised Daymark system has been clinically proven to align the stroke more effectively than any other method. 

Market research indicates that Odyssey grips maintain their grip quality more consistently through extended use compared to many competitors, though some golfers prefer the classic shapes of other manufacturers. 

![Odyssey-Putter-Grips-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Odyssey-Putter-Grips-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the sizing options?

Each Odyssey grip model offers standard and oversize versions. Oversize grips range from 3.4 to 3.8 inches in circumference, while standard models measure between 2.6 to 2.8 inches, depending on the specific grip style. 

The company also produces left-handed versions of all grip models, with standard left-handed grips being exactly half an inch shorter than right-handed counterparts. 


### How do I choose the right grip for me?

Odyssey recommends selecting a grip based on your hand size and personal preference. Players with smaller hands often prefer the Tour Standard sizes, while those with larger hands or arthritis symptoms typically opt for the larger Tour Preferred model. 

Try out both standard and oversize versions to determine which provides the most stable and comfortable feel for your putting stroke. 

![Odyssey-Putter-Grips-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Odyssey-Putter-Grips-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How durable are Odyssey putter grips?

Independent tests have shown Odyssey grips maintain their shape and texture better than many competitors during extended use. The company's proprietary materials resist compression damage common to standard rubber grips. 

However, severe impacts or excessive twisting can still damage the grip, particularly around the Daymark area. Regular inspection for cracks or indentations ensures optimal performance. 


### What maintenance is required?

Cleaning requires simple maintenance using mild soap and water. Avoid harsh chemicals that can damage the grip surface or cause premature cracking. 

If the grip becomes excessively worn or shows signs of damage, replace it at the first opportunity. Worn grips can significantly impact putting performance and accuracy.
