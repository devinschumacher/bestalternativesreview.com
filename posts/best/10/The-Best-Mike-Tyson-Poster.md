## Buyer's Guide

A Mike Tyson poster adds a powerful visual statement to any room, combining iconic sports imagery with compelling storytelling. These posters range from detailed action shots to authentic competition photos, each capturing the legendary boxer in his prime. 


### Size and Style Options

Popular sizes include standard 20x24 inches and larger wall-filling options up to 36x48 inches. Style variations range from glossy photo prints to premium canvas wraps that give the image depth and texture. Consider the room's dimensions and your personal preference for finish. 


### Print Quality and Durability

Higher-quality prints use archival ink that resists fading for lasting color and detail. Look for reinforced corners and sturdy mounting materials if the poster will be in a high-traffic area. Premium options often include UV coating to protect against scarring and moisture damage. 


### Frame Selection

Frames come in various materials from wood to metal, with styles ranging from simple matte black to ornate gold-leaf designs. Consider the frame's width - larger frames draw more attention but can overwhelm smaller spaces. The frame's finish should complement your existing decor while protecting the poster's edges. 


### Budget and Value

Entry-level posters start around $10 and are suitable for occasional display or rentals. Mid-range options priced between $20-50 offer the best value with quality materials and print precision. For investment pieces, consider prints from original photos or limited-edition reproductions commanding higher prices.
