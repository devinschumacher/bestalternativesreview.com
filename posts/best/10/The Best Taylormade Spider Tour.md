## Buyer's Guide

Taylormade's Spider Tour lineup represents the brand's commitment to precision and performance in putter design. The series combines advanced technology with refined aesthetics, offering golfers a range of options to enhance their putting ability. Understanding the key features and how they impact performance is crucial when selecting the right Spider Tour putter for your game. 


### Design Elements

The Spider Tour features a distinctive head design that incorporates the company's Zero Gravity sole technology. This design reduces weighting at the heel and toe, allowing for more precise center-of-gravity positioning. The visual elements, including the signature "Spider" crosshatch pattern, contribute to improved alignment and putting consistency. 


### Weight Distribution

Optimal weight distribution is crucial for putting performance. The Zero Gravity sole helps balance the putter's weight, making it feel more responsive during the stroke. The traditional mallet shape in the Spider family, particularly the 9h model, provides a larger sweet spot for less technically demanding players. For those seeking more precise control, the blade models like the 1h offer a more compact design with less overhead weight. 


### Standardization vs. Customization

The Spider Tour models come with standard lengths and face angles, which can be adjusted in the shop for minimal changes. Understanding your specific needs in terms of lie angle and shaft length is crucial before making a selection. Custom fitting services that offer precise adjustments for these parameters can significantly enhance the putter's compatibility with your swing. 


### Personalization Options

Taylormade offers several customization options to match the Spider Tour with your personal preferences. Adjustable hosels allow for lie angle and shaft length modifications, while various grip options including milled, tacky, and dual-texture grips can improve your putting grip feel. Consider your preferred grip size and texture when selecting the right Spider Tour model. 


## FAQ


### What are the key features of the Taylormade Spider Tour putter?

The Taylormade Spider Tour putter combines precision-milled face technology with a refined Tour-inspired design. The face features 150 precision-milled lines that enhance ball roll and consistency across the striking surface. 

The putter's offset design promotes a square-to-target impact, while the shallow hosel helps maintain a stable stance during the putting stroke. The milled lines range from 0.002" to 0.006" in depth, providing consistent feedback regardless of impact location. 


### How does the Tour Putter's offset affect my putting stance?

The offset design in the Tour Putter creates a more natural, golf stance, with the grip positioned slightly ahead of the ball. This promotes a square-to-target impact position, crucial for consistent putting. 

Players with longer arms or those who struggle with impact consistency may find the offset more forgiving. However, players with shorter arms or those who prefer a more traditional putting posture might need time to adapt to the new stance. 


### What grip options are available for the Tour Putter?

The Tour Putter features a standard 170mm (6.7") grip length with a standard thickness. Taylormade offers an additional 175mm (6.9") grip length for players with longer arms or prefer more extended reach. 

The grip surface features a micro-textured finish that reduces slippage while maintaining a comfortable feel during the swing. Both standard and extended grip options are available in multiple grip materials, including standard rubber and Velcro. 


### What are the weight options for the Tour Putter?

The Tour Putter comes in two primary weight configurations: 350 grams for players who prefer a higher-moment-of-inertia (MOI) feel, and 325 grams for those who prefer a more traditional weight distribution. 

Additional weight options are available by drilling and filling the sole slot. The standard configuration offers 11 grams of removable weight, which can be added or removed to fine-tune the balance and feel of the putter. 


### How much does the Tour Putter weigh?

The standard Tour Putter weighs 350 grams, which features a higher moment of inertia (MOI) design for added stability during the putting stroke. The lighter 325-gram version offers similar Tour-inspired features with reduced mass. 

Players can further customize the weight through the sole slot system, which allows adding or removing 11 grams of removable weight. This system helps fine-tune the putter's balance and feel to match individual swing preferences. 


### What are the putter head sizes available?

The Tour Putter offers two primary head sizes: standard and plus. The standard head measures 400cc, while the plus version increases the size to 420cc, providing more surface area for impact. 

The larger plus version extends the milled lines across more of the face surface, potentially offering more consistent ball roll. Both head sizes maintain the precision-milled technology and offset design that define the Tour Putter's performance.
