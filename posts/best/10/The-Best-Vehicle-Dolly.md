## Buyer's Guide

A vehicle dolly is a versatile tool for safely transporting small to medium-sized vehicles, particularly useful for storage, shipping, or moving short distances. Understanding the key aspects of vehicle dollies will help you select the right equipment for your needs. 


### Size and Weight Capacity

Consider the vehicle's dimensions and weight when selecting a dolly. Most dollies support between 2,000 to 5,000 pounds, but specialty models handle heavier loads. The dolly's wheelbase should match your vehicle's length to prevent tipping. 


### Wheel Design and Ground Clearance

Smooth, heavy-duty wheels are essential for stable transport. The dolly should have adequate ground clearance to navigate uneven surfaces while maintaining wheel contact with the vehicle's suspension. 


### Braking and Stability Features

Effective brakes prevent accidental movement during transport. Look for dollies with quality brakes that activate when the vehicle goes into reverse or tilt. Stable platforms with proper locking mechanisms prevent side-to-side sway. 


### Portability and Storage

Ergonomic handles and foldable designs enhance mobility. Consider dollies with detachable wheels for storage or specialty models that attach to vehicle components for easy transport to the loading area. 


## FAQ


### What is a vehicle dolly?

A vehicle dolly is a portable ramp system designed to lift the rear of a vehicle off the ground, enabling easier access for loading and unloading. These devices are commonly used by mechanics, automotive enthusiasts, and professional transport services. 

Most vehicle dollies consist of a metal ramp with a hydraulic or mechanical lift mechanism. They can support various vehicle sizes, from compact cars to light trucks, making them versatile tools for automotive maintenance and transportation. 


### How does a vehicle dolly work?

A typical vehicle dolly consists of a sloped metal ramp with a raised platform at the front. When positioned under a vehicle, the ramp allows you to drive onto it. The lift mechanism then raises the rear of the vehicle off the ground, creating an incline that helps with loading and unloading. 

The hydraulic or mechanical lift can be activated using a hand pump or electric motor. Once the vehicle is raised to the desired height, it can be safely moved forward or backward using the ramp's incline. 


### What types of vehicle dollies are available?

Vehicle dollies come in several designs, including single-post, double-post, and four-post models. Single-post dollies are portable with a single hydraulic jack, while double and four-post models provide greater stability with multiple lifting points. 

Some dollies feature adjustable height mechanisms, while others have fixed heights. Portable dollies are commonly made of aluminum or steel, while heavier-duty models may include weight-bearing capacities of up to 5,000 pounds. 


### What size vehicle can a dolly support?

The maximum vehicle size that a dolly can support depends on its rating. Most portable aluminum dollies can handle compact cars and light trucks, while heavier-duty steel models can support up to 5,000 pounds. 

When selecting a dolly, measure the vehicle's length and height. Consider the dolly's weight capacity and the maximum load it can safely lift to ensure proper vehicle support during use. 


### How do I safely use a vehicle dolly?

To use a vehicle dolly safely, place it on a flat, stable surface away from obstacles. Position the dolly under the vehicle's frame, ensuring the ramp is securely in place. Engage the lift mechanism to raise the vehicle, keeping weight distributed evenly. 

When loading or unloading, always face the vehicle towards the ramp. Ensure the ramp is clear of debris and that the vehicle's wheels are properly aligned before raising it. Never exceed the dolly's weight rating and maintain a secure grip on the vehicle's frame during use. 


### How should I maintain a vehicle dolly?

Regular maintenance for a vehicle dolly involves checking the lift mechanism for proper operation, ensuring all bolts and fasteners are tight, and inspecting the ramp for signs of wear or damage. Always perform maintenance according to the manufacturer's guidelines. 

Store the dolly in a dry, covered area when not in use. Keep it clean and free of grease or debris that could affect the lift mechanism's operation. Replace any worn components, such as hydraulic seals or lifting cables, according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
