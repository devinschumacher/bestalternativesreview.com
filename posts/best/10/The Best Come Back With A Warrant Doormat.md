The standard model measures 24 inches by 12 inches, providing ample space for wiping shoes. A larger 36-inch by 12-inch version is also available for wider entrances.

Keep in mind that bold colors may require more frequent maintenance to retain their appearance. 


### What if I change my mind about the text?

Most manufacturers allow returns or exchanges within 30 days if you're not satisfied with the text. Before placing your order, check the specific return policy for your chosen retailer. 

If you've customized the text and decide to change it later, special order fees may apply, so it's best to select your preferred wording at the time of purchase.
