## Buyer's Guide

RV leveling blocks are essential for ensuring your recreational vehicle has proper stability and leveling, especially when parking on uneven surfaces. These blocks help distribute weight evenly across the campground site, protecting both your vehicle and the surface below. 


### Key Features to Consider

RV leveling blocks come in various materials, including rubber, plastic, and metal. Rubber blocks are popular for their durability and vibration absorption. Consider the maximum load capacity that matches your RV's weight. Blocks with adjustable height usually offer more flexibility in finding the perfect level.

### Size and Number of Blocks

Standard RV lengths require different numbers of leveling blocks. A basic setup typically includes two blocks at each corner, while longer RVs might need additional blocks for added stability. Measure the distance between opposing corners of your RV to determine proper block placement. 


### Installation and Placement

Proper placement is crucial for safe RV leveling. Start by checking the levelness of your RV's floor. Place blocks under the highest points, and use shims if needed to achieve a 1/4-inch level surface. Avoid placing blocks under weight-bearing axles to prevent uneven load distribution.

### Maintenance and Storage

Inspect leveling blocks regularly for wear, cracks, or loose connections. Store blocks in a dry place when not in use to prevent damage. Consider keeping an extra set for campgrounds with notoriously uneven surfaces or for extended trips. 


## FAQ

![RV-Leveling-Blocks-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/RV-Leveling-Blocks-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are RV leveling blocks?

RV leveling blocks are adjustable blocks placed under RV jacks to level and stabilize campers on uneven ground. They help ensure proper weight distribution and prevent damage from improper camping site conditions. 

These blocks typically feature a compact design with three or four legs, offering stable support and adjustable height for precise leveling. They're made from durable materials like rubber or plastic-coated metal to protect both the RV and the ground surface. 


### How do I use RV leveling blocks?

Follow these steps to use leveling blocks effectively: position the jack under the desired corner; place a block under the jack head; raise the jack until the block contacts the ground; adjust the block height; repeat for all corners. 

Always check for unevenness by walking around the RV's perimeter when the jack is fully extended. Make sure all corners touch the ground simultaneously for optimal stability. 

![RV-Leveling-Blocks-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/RV-Leveling-Blocks-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What factors should I consider when choosing RV leveling blocks?

Size and height range are crucial - standard blocks offer 2-4 inches of adjustment, while longer blocks may extend leveling capabilities. Material durability and weight capacity directly impact product longevity and safety. 

Consider storage space, jack compatibility, and grip features. Some blocks include non-slip exteriors or raised edges to prevent tipping during use. 


### How do leveling blocks affect RV stability?

Properly used leveling blocks enhance stability by ensuring all RV legs rest on level ground. This prevents wobbling, reduces strain on supporting structures, and maintains the structural integrity of your camping setup. 

Uneven surfaces without adequate leveling can cause weight imbalances, leading to excessive pressure on wheels or uneven jack loading. Leveling blocks distribute weight evenly across all support points. 

![RV-Leveling-Blocks-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/RV-Leveling-Blocks-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can leveling blocks prevent damage from poor ground conditions?

Yes, blocks protect RVs from damage by lifting them above uneven ground, preventing direct contact with rocks, roots, or other terrain irregularities. This reduces wear and tear on tires and suspension components. 

Proper use of blocks can prevent settlement issues when camping on soft or uneven ground. However, they're most effective when combined with proper site selection and leveling techniques. 


### What maintenance is required for leveling blocks?

Regular inspection for wear, cracks, or missing parts ensures continued safety and proper function. Check legs for stability and block surfaces for smooth operation. 

Store blocks in a dry, protected location when not in use. Clean them with mild soap and water to remove dirt and debris, especially after use in sandy or muddy conditions.
