When I first sprayed this, I thought "Oh wow, it's like stepping into a garden right when the sun just started to peek through the morning fog. " The pomegranate and lemon upfront are sharp and clean, like biting into a perfectly ripe fruit right off the tree. Then the rose petal and apple come into play, which is where it gets really nice - imagine petting the softest rose in your garden. The jasmine and wisteria in the base are so subtle you might miss them at first, but they give it that little extra something special. It's not the subtlest scent out there - some people love it this way, but if you're into those really bold, memorable scents, this might just be your new favorite.

Still, it's a decent way to test out a few Burberry favorites before making a bigger purchase.
