## Buyer's Guide

A Dark & Lovely relaxer is a chemical solution used in hair relaxer processes to permanently alter the shape of natural curls. This buyer's guide helps you understand the key aspects of selecting the right relaxer for your hair type and styling goals. 


### Understanding the Relaxer Process

A Dark & Lovely relaxer works by breaking down the disulfide bonds in keratin, which gives natural hair its curl pattern. This process, known as hair straightening, can range from light to extreme depending on the product's strength and application technique. Understanding your hair's natural texture and desired outcome is crucial for selecting the appropriate relaxer. 


### Product Strengths and Types

Dark & Lovely offers various relaxer strengths, from mild to powerful formulas, each designed for specific hair types and conditions. Mild relaxers are suitable for hair that curls tightly, while more potent formulas address more relaxed natural textures. The product's strength should match your hair's natural curl pattern and your desired straightness level. 


### Application and Processing Time

Relaxer application typically requires 30-60 minutes, followed by processing time that can range from 30 minutes to overnight, depending on the product's intensity. The application process should be performed by a professional, especially for intermediate to advanced relaxers. Proper application ensures even distribution and prevents chemical damage. 


### Aftercare and Maintenance

Dark & Lovely recommends specific aftercare routines to maintain healthy, straight hair. These typically include regular deep conditioning, protective styling, and avoiding excessive heat styling. Understanding proper maintenance helps extend the relaxer's effectiveness while preserving hair health. 


## FAQ


### What is Dark and Lovely Relaxer?

Dark and Lovely Relaxer is a temporary hair straightening solution specifically formulated for curly hair. It allows African American women to achieve smooth, straight hair without permanently altering their natural texture. 

The product contains keratin proteins that temporarily realign the hair strands, resulting in smoother, more manageable hair for several weeks before returning to its natural curl pattern. 


### How does Dark and Lovely Relaxer work?

Dark and Lovely Relaxer works by breaking the disulfide bonds in hair strands that create natural curls. Keratin proteins are applied to the hair shaft, where they temporarily realign the strands, creating straighter hair. 

The process requires proper application and processing time to ensure even treatment across all hair strands. The results typically last 6-8 weeks before natural curl patterns return. 


### Who is Dark and Lovely Relaxer suitable for?

The product is designed for African American women with curly or wavy hair who want temporary straightening results. It's suitable for all hair types and textures within the curly/wavy spectrum. 

However, it's important to note that this treatment is not recommended for individuals with hair conditions like alopecia, hair loss, or severe scalp issues. 


### What are the steps to use Dark and Lovely Relaxer?

Before application, thoroughly cleanse the scalp and hair with a mild shampoo, leaving it slightly damp. Apply the relaxer to the mid-lengths to ends of damp hair, avoiding the scalp. Wait 45 minutes, then apply a second layer to ends only, processing for an additional 30-60 minutes. 

After processing, rinse thoroughly, deep condition, and apply a suitable heat protectant before styling with a wide-tooth comb. Always follow product instructions carefully to achieve optimal results. 


### How long does Dark and Lovely Relaxer last?

The straightening effects of Dark and Lovely Relaxer typically last 6-8 weeks, depending on hair type, processing time, and individual hair growth rate. Regular washing may shorten the lasting effect. 

Once the relaxer has worn off, natural curl patterns will return. To maintain straight hair between applications, use a curl-defining mousse or gel and a heat protectant when styling with heat tools. 


### Are there any potential side effects?

Dark and Lovely Relaxer is generally safe when used as directed; however, some users may experience mild scalp irritation, redness, or itching during processing. If this occurs, neutralize immediately with a neutralizer solution or clear conditioner. 

Always perform a patch test before full application and avoid getting the product in the eyes. If irritation persists, discontinue use and consult a dermatologist.
