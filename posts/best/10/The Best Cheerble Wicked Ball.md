## Buyer's Guide

A Cheerble Wicked Ball combines bouncy fun with competitive challenge, making it a standout addition to any indoor game collection. Understanding its key features will help you choose the right ball for your space and playstyle. 


### Size and Weight

The ball's dimensions typically range from 3.5 to 4 inches in diameter, with a weight between 1.5 to 2 ounces. These measurements allow for quick, precise movements while maintaining adequate bounce for competitive play. 


### Material and Construction

Most Cheerble Wicked Balls feature a durable rubber core surrounded by a protective PVC coating. This construction ensures long-lasting performance while providing just the right balance of bounce and durability for indoor use. 


### Bounce and Grip

The surface texture affects both bounce consistency and player grip. Look for a pattern that offers good traction but allows for smooth, controlled tosses. The ideal ball should maintain consistent bounce height across multiple uses.
