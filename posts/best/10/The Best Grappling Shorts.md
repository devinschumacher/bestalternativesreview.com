## Buyer's Guide

When it comes to grappling shorts, functionality and durability are key. These shorts are designed for intense training and competition, so they need to perform under pressure. Here's what to consider when choosing the right pair for you. 


### Core Features

Look for shorts with a durable, moisture-wicking fabric that maintains breathability during intense training sessions. The construction should include reinforced stitching in high-wear areas like the knees and waistband to prevent tearing. 

![Grappling-Shorts-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Grappling-Shorts-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Fit and Mobility

A properly fitting pair of grappling shorts should allow for full range of motion while providing adequate coverage. The waistband should sit comfortably around the hips without constricting movement, and the length should reach just above the knee to protect the thighs. 


### Additional Considerations

Some grapplers prefer compression-style shorts that provide extra support and prevent bunching during submissions. Others may opt for looser shorts for greater comfort during extended training sessions. Consider whether you need quick-drying properties or if traditional cotton shorts are sufficient for your training environment. 

![Grappling-Shorts-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Grappling-Shorts-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Maintenance

Since these shorts see heavy use, they need to hold up well to repeated washing. Choose a material that maintains its shape and color after multiple washes. Consider how easy the shorts are to clean and maintain between training sessions. 


## FAQ

![Grappling-Shorts-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Grappling-Shorts-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are grappling shorts?

Grappling shorts are specialized athletic wear designed for grappling sports like Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and ground-fighting martial arts. These shorts feature unique design elements that enhance performance and provide protection during intense training sessions and competitive matches. 

Standard features include compression mesh panels for breathability, moisture-wicking fabric to keep you dry, and reinforced stitching around the waste for durability. Some models also incorporate padded stitching or built-in guards for additional protection against strikes and submissions. 


### Why choose grappling shorts?

Grappling shorts offer several advantages over regular athletic shorts. The compression mesh and moisture-wicking properties help regulate body temperature and prevent chafing during intense training sessions. The reinforced stitching and protective padding ensure the shorts can withstand the demands of grappling, including frequent rolling, submissions, and impact. 

These specialized shorts also improve performance by providing a second-skin fit that enhances mobility and allows for precise technique execution. The built-in protection features help prevent common grappling injuries, making them an essential investment for serious practitioners. 

![Grappling-Shorts-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Grappling-Shorts-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the key elements of quality grappling shorts?

When selecting grappling shorts, look for durable moisture-wicking fabrics that can handle repeated washing without losing their shape. The shorts should have a secure, elasticated waistband with no excessive stretching or sagging. Padding quality is crucial for protect guards; well-made models use reinforced stitching in key impact areas like hips and thighs. 

Consider shorts with zippered pockets for storing personal items, and look for seam construction that minimizes irritation during movement. The compression mesh panels should be placed strategically to balance breathability with coverage, ensuring comfortable ventilation during intense sessions. 


### Do grappling shorts need to be worn under gi or uniform?

In most grappling gyms, it's recommended to wear a quality pair of grappling shorts under your gi or training uniform for several reasons. The shorts help absorb sweat and protect your gi against stains and fabric damage, while also providing additional padding for your comfort during training. 

However, the necessity of wearing under attire can vary by gym culture. Some schools require it as part of their dress code, while others allow practitioners to train in just the gi. Always check with your specific gym or competition regulations to determine their stance on undergarments. 

![Grappling-Shorts-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Grappling-Shorts-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How should grappling shorts fit?

Grappling shorts should fit snugly but not be overly tight. The compression mesh panels need to sit closely against your skin to maximize moisture management and ventilation, while the elasticated waistband should sit comfortably around your natural waistline without constricting your breathing. 

These shorts are typically shorter than regular athletic shorts, with most designs ending just above the knee. The length helps prevent bunching during training movements and allows for full range of motion. If you can fit two fingers between the waistband and your skin, the shorts are likely a good fit. 


### How long do grappling shorts last?

With regular use, quality grappling shorts typically last 6-12 months before signs of wear appear. Factors affecting longevity include the intensity of your training, frequency of use, and care practices. Shorts that display stretched elastic, faded mesh panels, or visible stitching damage indicate it's time for replacement. 

Proper care extends your shorts' lifespan significantly. After each use, wash the shorts in a mesh bag to protect them from snagging during the wash cycle. Avoid using fabric softeners or harsh detergents, which can break down the moisture-wicking properties of the fabric. Store the shorts in a dry place to prevent odor and mildew buildup.
