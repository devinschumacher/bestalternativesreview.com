## Buyer's Guide

A Lortone rock tumbler is an essential tool for rockhounds and mineral enthusiasts, helping to shape and polish raw specimens into stunning gem-like objects. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select an appropriate tumbler and set up your project successfully. 


### Capacity and Size

Consider the size of rocks you want to tumble. Each machine has a maximum charge capacity, typically measured in pounds. For small projects or when space is limited, choose a tabletop model. For larger specimens, a floor-standing tumbler with increased capacity will be necessary. 


### Speed Settings

Most tumblers offer adjustable speed settings, which affect the tumbling process. Higher speeds are suitable for breaking down rough material, while lower speeds are ideal for polishing. Some advanced models include multiple speeds specifically optimized for different stages of tumbling. 


### Materials and Construction

Look for a tumbler made from durable materials that can withstand the constant vibration and impact of the tumbling process. Cast iron or heavy-duty steel construction provides the longest-lasting performance. The base should be secure to prevent tipping during operation. 


### Automation Features

Some modern tumblers include automatic shut-off features that prevent damage and ensure consistent processing times. These machines often come with digital displays showing running time and remaining cycles. Consider these features for a more controlled and efficient tumbling experience. 


## FAQ


### What is a Lortone Rock Tumbler?

A Lortone Rock Tumbler is a countertop appliance designed to smooth and polish rocks through a process called rock tumbling. The machine rotates abrasive materials and rock samples in a sealed chamber to gradually remove surface imperfections and create a polished finish. 

These tumblers are suitable for hobbyists and collectors who want to improve the appearance of their rock and mineral specimens. The process can take anywhere from several hours to multiple days, depending on the size and hardness of the rocks being polished. 


### What Materials Can I Use in a Lortone Rock Tumbler?

Standard tumbling materials include steel media (pellets or balls), lava rock, and walnut shells. Each material serves a specific purpose in the polishing process, ranging from aggressive grinding to fine polishing. 

You can also tumble fossils, gemstones, and petrified wood, but always consult the specific tumbler's guidelines as different materials may have varying tumbling requirements. 


### How Do I Clean and Maintain My Lortone Rock Tumbler?

After each use, remove all media and rocks from the chamber and wipe down the exterior with a damp cloth. Clean the interior with mild soap and water, ensuring it's completely dry before use. 

The drum and lids should be inspected regularly for wear or damage. Replace any parts that show signs of stress or deformation to prevent contamination during the tumbling process. 


### What Size Rocks Can I Tumble?

Most Lortone rock tumblers are designed to handle rocks ranging from 1/4 inch to 3 inches in diameter. Always check the specific model's specifications as size limitations can vary. 

Small rocks polish quickly, while larger pieces require longer tumbling times and may have different polishing requirements. Experiment with different sizes to find the optimal tumbling time for your specific rock sample. 


### How Long Does It Take to Tumble Rocks?

The tumbling time varies based on rock size, shape, and material composition. Small, uniform rocks may polish in 24-48 hours, while larger or more irregularly shaped rocks can take several days to a week. 

For best results, separate different rock types and sizes into different tumbling sessions. A general rule of thumb is to allow 3-5 days per inch of rock diameter for optimal polishing. 


### How Do I Know When My Rocks Are Ready?

Check the rocks after the initial tumbling period has ended. They should be smooth to the touch with consistent color and clarity. Look for any remaining high points, pits, or unpolished areas that indicate additional tumbling time is needed. 

Use a magnifying glass to inspect the rock surface for any remaining roughness or imperfections. Keep in mind that some specimens may require multiple tumbling cycles to achieve the desired polish.
