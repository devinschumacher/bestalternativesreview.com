Bose is renowned for its audio technology, and the A20 headsets deliver exceptional clarity with advanced noise-cancellation capabilities. The active noise reduction system helps maintain communication quality in noisy environments, while the dual-driver design provides rich, balanced sound. 


### Comfort and Fit

Extended wear comfort is crucial for aviation headsets. Look for models with adjustable headbands and ear cushions that maintain a secure fit while allowing ventilation to prevent overheating. The A20 headsets feature a flexible design that allows for movement during flight while keeping the audio quality intact.

## FAQ


### What's the primary technical specification of the Bose A20 headset?

The Bose A20 headset delivers active noise cancellation through its 13-microphone system, with each earcup containing four dedicated microphones. This advanced noise-cancellation technology effectively blocks out cabin noise, providing clearer audio. 

The headset operates on a frequency range of 300-2,600 Hz, with a nominal impedance of 60 ohms. It has a maximum input level of 120 dB and features 10-level volume control. 


### How does the active noise cancellation work?

Inside each earcup, four microphones work together with a digital signal processor to analyze ambient noise. The processor generates an inverse sound wave that cancels out the incoming noise before it reaches your ears. 

This process happens in real-time, adapting to changes in cabin noise levels. However, it's important to note that extreme ambient noise levels may reduce the effectiveness of the active cancellation. 


### What are the key features of the Bose A20's audio capabilities?

The headset supports both analog and digital audio inputs, making it compatible with various aircraft communication systems. It delivers stereo audio with clear mid-range and bass response. 

Active noise cancellation can be disabled through a flip lever on the earcup for certain communications, while the 10-level volume control allows precise adjustment of audio levels. 


### How long does the battery last, and how is it charged?

The Bose A20 operates on a single AA battery, providing approximately 12 hours of continuous use per charge. The battery can be removed for replacement during flights. 

Charging is done using a micro-USB port. The headset comes with a USB power adapter and can also be charged using a standard USB port. 


### What makes the Bose A20 different from other aviation headsets?

Unlike many older aviation headsets, the Bose A20 uses advanced active noise cancellation technology rather than passive foam ear cups. This results in clearer audio and improved comfort during long flights. 

The headset also features better wireless options, with the ability to pair with multiple devices using Bluetooth. It's the first commercial aviation headset to use Bluetooth technology, according to Bose. 


### Who should consider buying these headsets?

The Bose A20 is ideal for pilots and flight crews who prioritize clear audio and comfortable long-term wear. The active noise cancellation and wireless capabilities make it particularly suitable for commercial airline operations. 

Business travelers and frequent fliers might also appreciate the improved audio quality and extended comfort features, though they typically wouldn't be approved for use on commercial aircraft.
