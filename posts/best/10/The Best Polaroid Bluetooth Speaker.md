## Buyer's Guide

A Polaroid Bluetooth speaker combines portability with wireless music streaming, perfect for outdoor gatherings or indoor parties. These speakers offer convenient features like Bluetooth connectivity and rechargeable batteries, making them a practical addition to your audio setup.

Select a model with robust Bluetooth functionality that supports the latest standards for stable connections and high-quality playback. Consider features like multi-device pairing and audio transcoding for better sound fidelity. 


### Build and Durability

Polaroid Bluetooth speakers often feature portable designs with built-in carabiners or stands. Choose a model with water-resistant construction (IP67 or higher) and robust materials for lasting performance in various environments. 


### Audio Quality and Range

Opt for speakers that offer balanced sound with good bass response and audible clarity up to 30 feet in open spaces. Higher-priced models may include advanced drivers for superior audio performance.

Calculate your power needs based on whether you plan to use the speaker for short bursts or continuous playback. Rechargeable battery life should support your typical usage with quick-charging options for more convenience. 


## FAQ


### How does the Polaroid Bluetooth speaker work?

This wireless speaker connects to your device via Bluetooth or auxiliary input. Once paired, you can play music directly from your phone, tablet, or computer without any cables. 

Just place the speaker in range of your device, select it from the list of available Bluetooth devices, and follow the on-screen instructions to connect. You'll need to keep it powered on and within Bluetooth range to use it. 


### What is the battery life like?

The speaker runs on a rechargeable battery that provides up to 12 hours of playback on a single charge. Playing music through Bluetooth typically drains the battery faster than using the auxiliary input. 

When the battery gets low, the speaker will begin flashing to alert you. You can charge it via USB, either through the speaker itself or with the included cable. 


### Can I use this speaker outdoors?

Yes, the speaker is water-resistant and has a built-in microphone for voice commands. While it's not completely waterproof, light rain or splashes from gardening won't damage it. 

For outdoor use, keep it in a dry place when not in use and protect it from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures. The built-in microphone lets you use voice assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant if you have the compatible app installed. 


### How loud is the sound?

At 6 watts of power, the speaker delivers decent volume for its size. In an average room, you should hear clear sound from about 10-15 feet away. 

The built-in subwoofer provides decent bass, making it suitable for casual listening in small to medium-sized rooms. For larger spaces or outdoor use, you might want to consider a portable outdoor speaker with more power. 


### What features does it have?

Basic functions include play, pause, skip tracks, and volume controls through the buttons on the bottom. You can also pair with multiple devices and use voice commands through the app. 

Advanced features like equalizer settings (not available through the buttons) can be accessed via the app, which also shows battery life and connection status. 


### Is it compatible with my device?

The speaker works with both iOS and Android devices. You'll need to have Bluetooth enabled on your phone or tablet to connect it via Bluetooth. 

If you only want to use it with a single device, you can pair it directly. For multi-device connections, you'll need the official Polaroid app, which supports creating a stereo pair or a group of speakers.
