Made for full-size trucks, these LED tailgate lights pack a ton of brightness thanks to 108 red and 108 white LEDs spread across two connected bars.

The whole thing is super durable—IP68 waterproof rating and all—but some folks have noted that the middle gap between the two bars is pretty noticeable. While it's not the cheapest LED light out there, the install is straightforward, and you get three times as many white LEDs as single-bar options.
