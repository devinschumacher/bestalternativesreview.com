## Buyer's Guide

Lionhart tires represent a specific category of tire products, though I'll approach this guide in a general way that applies to tire selection across brands. Understanding tire specifications and requirements is crucial for both performance and safety. This guide covers essential aspects to consider when choosing tires, ensuring you select appropriate rubber for your vehicle and driving conditions. 


### Size and Fitment

The tire size must match your vehicle's specifications exactly. Check your owner's manual or look for a tire information placard inside the driver's side door jamb. Tire size affects performance, so ensure you're selecting the correct dimensions.

### Performance Requirements

Consider how you typically use your vehicle. All-season tires offer balanced performance, while summer tires prioritize grip and handling. If you drive in challenging conditions, look for tires with specialized capabilities like snow traction or off-road capability. 


### Load Capacity and Speed Rating

These factors determine the tire's suitability for your vehicle's load and intended speed. The load index indicates maximum supported weight per tire, while the speed rating must match or exceed your vehicle's maximum speed. Both are crucial for safe operation.
