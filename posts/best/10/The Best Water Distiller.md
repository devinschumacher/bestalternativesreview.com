## Buyer's Guide

A water distiller purifies water through evaporation and condensation, effectively removing impurities. This guide outlines key features and considerations to help you select the right distiller for your needs. 


### Evaporation Process

Water distillers heat water until it turns into steam, which then condenses back into liquid form in a separate collection container. This process removes dissolved solids, bacteria, and viruses, resulting in purified water. 


### Purification Capabilities

Modern distillers typically remove 99.9% of contaminants, including heavy metals, scales, and bacteria. However, they do not filter out volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or gases. Consider your specific purification needs when selecting a distiller. 


### Water Output and Consumption

Distillers vary in water output, with some producing up to 12 liters per day. The distillation process requires significant water consumption - expect to use about 6 liters of water for every 1 liter of clean water produced. This high water usage is a key factor in choosing the right unit. 


### Maintenance Requirements

Regular maintenance includes cleaning the distiller's interior, replacing descaling solution, and checking seals and filters. Consider your comfort level with these tasks when selecting a distiller. Some models require more frequent maintenance than others. 


## FAQ


### What is a water distiller?

A water distiller is a device that removes impurities from water through a distillation process. Unlike filtration systems that trap contaminants, distillation separates water molecules from dissolved solids, bacteria, and other impurities by boiling the water and collecting the condensed steam, which is free from these contaminants. 

Water distillers are available in various sizes, from countertop models for home use to larger systems for commercial applications. The process produces high-quality water suitable for drinking, cooking, and other household needs. 


### How effective are water distillers?

Water distillers remove a wide range of contaminants, including heavy metals, bacteria, viruses, and dissolved solids like sodium and calcium. However, they are less effective at removing certain contaminants, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), if they are present in gaseous form when the distillate is collected. 

While distillation removes virtually all contaminants, it is important to maintain the distiller and regularly replace filters (if applicable) to maintain optimal performance. 


### What types of water can be used with a distiller?

Water distillers can process any water source, including tap water, well water, or harvested rainwater. However, the initial water quality affects the distillation process and the quality of the output water. Using cleaner water as input will typically result in better purified water output. 

If the source water contains significant amounts of sediments or large particles, a pre-filter may be necessary to prevent clogging the distiller and maintaining proper functioning. 


### How often should a water distiller be maintained?

Water distillers require regular cleaning and maintenance to prevent mineral buildup and ensure proper function. The frequency of maintenance depends on usage, water source quality, and manufacturer recommendations, but generally requires cleaning the holding tank monthly and descaling the unit every 3-6 months. 

Additional maintenance tasks include checking and cleaning the cooling fins (for units with external coolers), lubricating moving parts, and inspecting electrical components. Filters should be replaced according to the manufacturer's guidelines, typically every 6-12 months. 


### What are the operational costs of running a water distiller?

The primary operational cost of a water distiller is electricity, which varies based on usage frequency and local power rates. Distillation processes consume more energy than filtration systems, but the cost is typically minimal for household use. 

Water costs depend on the source and amount consumed. Distilling tap water is generally more cost-effective than purchasing bottled water, but the exact savings vary based on local water pricing and usage habits. 


### Are there any limitations to water distillers?

Water distillers effectively remove most contaminants but consume significant amounts of water, producing only a small fraction compared to the input volume. For example, a gallon of distilled water requires about 3-8 gallons of water input, depending on the unit's efficiency and inlet water temperature. 

The distillation process removes beneficial minerals along with contaminants, so it's recommended to maintain appropriate mineral content in your water through alternatives like mineral drops or reverse osmosis post-treatment.
