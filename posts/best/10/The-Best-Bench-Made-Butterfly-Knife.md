## Buyer's Guide

Bench-made butterfly knives combine practicality with a distinctive folding mechanism. Understanding key aspects will help you select the right blade for your needs. 


### Blade Design and Folding Mechanism

Butterfly knives feature a distinctive pop-up mechanism where the blade springs out from the handle in an overhead motion. Consider whether you prefer manual lockback, liner lock, or framelock mechanisms for added stability during deployment. The blade shape (serrated, straight, or compound) affects cutting performance and legality in different jurisdictions. 


### Handle Construction and Material

Handle materials range from traditional stainless steel to composite materials like G10 or aluminum. Consider factors like grip texture, corrosion resistance, and weight when choosing between different handle designs. The blade-to-handle ratio impacts overall balance and ease of use. 


### Legal Considerations

Check local laws regarding carry restrictions and blade length for butterfly knives. Understanding legal requirements ensures your chosen knife remains legal and practical for daily use. 


### Size and Weight

Standard butterfly knives typically measure between 6-12 inches in overall length. Heavier blades offer more cutting power but may be less convenient for concealed carry or lightweight tasks. 


## FAQ


### What is a Benchmade Butterfly Knife?

A Benchmade butterfly knife (also known as a flick knife) is a manually assisted folding knife with a distinctive blade that "butterflies" open when flipped open. The blade deploys via a spring mechanism that catches on the blade's clip point when released, flipping the blade open quickly. 

These knives typically feature lightweight construction, durable materials, and ergonomic handles. Many models include safety features to prevent accidental deployment, especially in public settings. 


### What are the key components of a Benchmade butterfly knife?

The primary components include the blade, clip point, handle frame, spring mechanism, and lock. The blade's clip point provides both functionality and visual appeal. The handle frame surrounds and protects the blade when closed, while the spring mechanism powers the opening action. 

The lock mechanism ensures the blade remains locked open during use while preventing accidental deployment when closed. Most models feature a finger groove or recessed surface for better grip stability during deployment. 


### What materials are used in Benchmade butterfly knives?

Common blade materials include stainless steel (often in 440C or AUS-8 grades), high-carbon stainless steel, and some Damascus steel patterns. These materials balance edge retention, corrosion resistance, and durability. 

Handle materials typically include G10 fiberglass-reinforced nylon, carbon fiber, stainless steel, or other composite materials. These provide optimal grip, weight, and durability for various usage environments. 


### How do you safely deploy and close a Benchmade butterfly knife?

To deploy, firmly pinch the blade and clip point together near the pivot point, then flip them apart. The spring mechanism will automatically open the blade. 

To close, grip the handle firmly and push the blade back toward the closed position. The clip point will engage with a stop mechanism as the blade approaches the fully closed position, locking it safely shut. 


### What is the legal status of Benchmade butterfly knives?

The legality of butterfly knives varies by country and local laws. They are legal in most states in the United States but may have restrictions or outright bans in some regions. 

Always check local laws before purchasing or carrying a butterfly knife. In international travel, they may be prohibited from carry-on or checked luggage due to safety regulations. 


### What are the different price points for Benchmade butterfly knives?

Entry-level models typically range from $60 to $100, offering basic features and materials. Mid-range models, including popular everyday carry (EDC) variants, usually cost between $100 and $200, with improved materials and features. 

High-end models featuring premium materials, custom finishes, or limited edition designs can range from $200 to over $500, providing superior performance and craftsmanship.
