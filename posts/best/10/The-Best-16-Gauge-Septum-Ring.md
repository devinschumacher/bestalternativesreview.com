## Buyer's Guide

A 16-gauge septum ring is a popular pierceable jewelry option, offering both versatility and style for nose piercings. Understanding the key aspects of these rings helps in selecting one that's comfortable, durable, and suitable for daily wear. 


### Material Quality

16-gauge septum rings come in various materials like titanium, surgical steel, and gold. Titanium and surgical steel are hypoallergenic and resistant to corrosion, making them ideal for sensitive skin. Gold options provide aesthetic appeal but require regular cleaning to maintain shine. 


### Design Considerations

The ring's design affects comfort and visibility. Standard round or oval rings allow for easy cleaning and inspection. Some designs include flat segments for reduced rotation, while others feature curves for enhanced style. Choosing a design that balances aesthetics with practicality ensures satisfaction. 


### Size and Fit

Proper sizing is crucial for comfort and healing. The ring should fit snugly but allow for slight movement. Using the correct gauge (16) ensures initial healing while providing years of wear. Regularly inspect the piercing site for signs of irritation or improper fit. 


### Maintenance Requirements

Regular cleaning with warm water and mild soap maintains hygiene and prevents infections. For materials like gold, weekly polishing helps preserve shine. Avoid harsh chemicals and alcohol-based sanitizers that can damage the jewelry material and surrounding skin. 


## FAQ


### What is a septum ring and how is it worn?

A septum ring is a type of body jewelry worn through the nasal septum, the cartilage wall separating the nostrils. It's typically worn vertically through a small hole created by a piercing. 

The ring can be worn solo or with other septum jewelry, such as barbells or nostril rings, depending on the piercer's technique and the individual's preference. 


### What gauge septum rings are available?

Septum rings are commonly available in 14 gauge and 16 gauge. 16 gauge rings (1.6mm diameter) are more common and suitable for daily wear. 

18 gauge options (1.8mm diameter) are available for those who prefer a slightly thicker ring, but 16 gauge is generally recommended for beginners. 


### What types of septum rings are popular?

The most common styles include plain rings, twisted rings, and star-shaped designs. Many piercers offer custom options with engravings or alternative materials like titanium or black iron. 

Some popular variations include split rings, which allow for easy maintenance, and curved rings, which can sit higher or lower in the septum hole. 


### How should I care for my septum ring?

Clean your septum ring daily with mild soap and water, or a specialized jewelry cleaner. Rinse thoroughly and allow it to air dry completely before wearing. 

Avoid using harsh chemicals, alcohol-based cleaners, or steam cleaners, as they can damage the jewelry or irritation around the piercing site. 


### What are the benefits of a 16 gauge septum ring?

A 16 gauge ring provides enough thickness for daily wear while maintaining a comfortable fit. It's less likely to twist or turn during activities compared to thinner gauges. 

The medium thickness also allows for easy maintenance and cleaning while providing adequate protection for the piercing site. 


### Who should consider getting a septum piercing?

Septum piercings are suitable for most adults with no known nasal infections or breathing issues. Individuals with allergies to metal should discuss material options with their piercer. 

Those considering a septum piercing should have pierced ears and a nose bridge piercing to ensure proper healing and minimize the risk of rejection.
