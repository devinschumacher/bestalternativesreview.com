## FAQ


### What is a mini toaster oven?

A mini toaster oven, also known as a compact or travel toaster oven, is a smaller version of the standard toaster oven. These appliances combine the functions of a regular toaster, oven, and broiler into one portable unit that typically measures between 6 and 12 inches in length.
