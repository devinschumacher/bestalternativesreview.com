## Buyer's Guide

The Ruger Wrangler holster is a popular choice for carrying the 22LR semi-automatic pistol. When selecting a holster, consider factors like retention, concealability, and comfort during carry. The holster type (IWB, OWB, or inside the pants) should match your carry preference and clothing style. 


### Retention and Security Features

Look for holsters with positive retention mechanisms like clips, straps, or tension screws to secure the firearm in place. The holster should prevent accidental discharge while providing quick draw capabilities. Consider thumbscrews or compression straps for fine-tuning retention to match your carry preference.

### Carry Position Options

The holster should offer multiple carry positions for flexibility. Inside-the-waistband (IWB) holsters provide concealment but may need additional support layers. Outside-the-waistband (OWB) holsters are more accessible but less concealed. Evaluate what positions are practical for your daily carry needs. 


### Material and Construction Quality

Sturdy holsters made from high-quality materials like durable plastic or synthetic leather last longer and provide better protection for your firearm. The interior lining should match the material type for proper friction and protection during carry.

### Compatibility and Fit

Ensure the holster fits your specific firearm model and caliber. The holster should sit correctly on your belt or garment without shifting. Consider how the holster affects your draw stroke and holstering motion to maintain usability.
