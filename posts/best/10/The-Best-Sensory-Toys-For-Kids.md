## Buyer's Guide

Sensory toys play a crucial role in a child's development by engaging their senses and promoting exploration. These toys help stimulate cognitive, motor, and social skills through interactive play experiences. When selecting sensory toys, consider factors like age appropriateness, material safety, and intended sensory stimulation. 


### Age Considerations

Age recommendations on toy packaging guide selection based on developmental appropriateness. Infants and toddlers benefit from simple, cause-and-effect toys that encourage hand-eye coordination and sensory exploration. Preschoolers can handle more complex toys that promote problem-solving and creativity. Always supervise play to ensure safety and appropriate use.
