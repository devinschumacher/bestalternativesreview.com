## FAQ

![Beetle-Spin-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Beetle-Spin-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are Beetle Spins?

Known for their distinctive spiral design, Beetle Spins are highly sensitive artificial lures that imitate the motion of swimming insects. These lures consist of a body with a series of interlocking sections that twist and turn when retrieved through the water. 

Developed to mimic the behavior of surface-dwelling insects, a key feature of Beetle Spins is their ability to create small whip-like movements at the end of the line, which can trigger strikes from wary fish. 


### What makes Beetle Spins different from traditional topwater lures?

While both catch fish by mimicking surface activity, Beetle Spins operate just below the surface. Their spiral design creates subtle, realistic movements that traditional topwater lures typically cannot replicate. 

The sensitivity of Beetle Spins allows anglers to feel subtle bites that might be missed with larger, more aggressive surface lures. Their effectiveness increases in clear water or when fishing for more selective, trophy-class fish. 

![Beetle-Spin-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Beetle-Spin-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is the ideal fishing application for Beetle Spins?

These lures excel in calm conditions, such as over calm lakes, reservoirs, and rivers with gentle currents. Their effectiveness increases when fishing over weed beds, around docks, or in areas with moderate surface disturbance. 

The subtle nature of Beetle Spins makes them particularly effective for trout, bass, and panfish. They can be fished alone, tied to a leader, or worked through schools of active fish to trigger strikes. 


### What techniques are recommended for using Beetle Spins?

The best approach is to maintain a steady retrieve speed while gently twitching or stopping occasionally to allow the lure to settle naturally. The subtle movements at the end of the line often trigger strikes from fish that are otherwise uninterested in your offering. 

Experiment with different retrieves, including varying speeds and pauses, to discover what works best in a given situation. Fish often react best when the lure is paused briefly before resuming a steady retrieve. 

![Beetle-Spin-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Beetle-Spin-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How should I choose between different Beetle Spin models?

Selecting the right model depends primarily on the water conditions and the type of fish you're targeting. Shallower water and smaller fish often respond best to smaller, faster models, while deeper water or larger fish may require larger, slower-retrieval lures. 

Consider the color patterns based on local conditions and fish preferences. Striped patterns often work well in clear water, while more natural colors may be preferred in stained water conditions. 


### What maintenance is needed for Beetle Spins?

Regular inspection for wear and damage is essential to maintain the lure's functionality. The interlocking sections should move freely; if there's resistance, the lure may need cleaning or may be worn out. 

Store the lures in a cool, dry place when not in use. After fishing, clean them with mild soap and water, then allow them to completely dry before storage to prevent odors and damage.
