## Buyer's Guide

A Poulan Pro leaf blower can significantly improve your fall cleanup and spring maintenance, but choosing the right model requires considering several key factors. This guide will help you understand the essential features and capabilities to look for when selecting a Poulan Pro leaf blower that meets your specific needs. 


### Power Source

Poulan Pro leaf blowers are available in both electric and gas-powered variants. Electric models, including corded and battery-operated versions, offer convenience and quiet operation but have limited reach due to cord restrictions or short battery life. Gas-powered blowers provide unmatched runtime and power, making them suitable for large yards or heavy debris, but require maintenance and fueling. 

![Poulan-Pro-Leaf-Blower-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Poulan-Pro-Leaf-Blower-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Blower Capacity

The blower capacity affects how much debris can be moved at once. Measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM), higher CFM ratings typically mean better performance. For small to medium yards, a CFM between 400 and 600 is adequate. Larger properties or those with significant leaf accumulation may benefit from models exceeding 600 CFM. 


### Maneuverability and Size

Leaf blowers vary significantly in size and weight, which impacts their maneuverability and ease of use. Lighter models (under 10 pounds) are easier to handle, especially for extended use. Consider models with ergonomic handles and comfortable grips to reduce hand fatigue during operation. The width of the blower's nozzle can also affect how effectively it can reach tight spaces or maneuver around obstacles.

### Additional Features

Look for models with adjustable nozzles that allow you to direct airflow precisely, which can improve efficiency and reduce waste. Some blowers include attachments like snow-shoveling tools or mulching capabilities, which can expand their utility beyond simple leaf blowing. Consider models with durable construction and weather-resistant components if you plan to use the blower in various conditions.

### Which Poulan Pro model is right for me?

For residential use, the PP600 or PP605 models are ideal due to their balance of power and maneuverability. For larger properties, consider the PP700 or PP800, which offer increased power and longer run times. 

The PP200 model is suitable for small spaces or light-duty use, making it a good choice for apartments or small gardens. 

![Poulan-Pro-Leaf-Blower-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Poulan-Pro-Leaf-Blower-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How much do Poulan Pro blowers weigh?

Lightweight design is a hallmark of Poulan Pro blowers. The PP200 weighs just 4.6 pounds, while the heavier models like the PP800 still manage only 11.4 pounds. 

This makes them easier to carry and maneuver, especially when blown leaves or debris make the blower heavier over time. 


### What maintenance do Poulan Pro blowers need?

Maintenance requirements are minimal thanks to the QUIKLEAN system, which prevents clogs and extends service intervals. The company recommends checking and cleaning the filter before each use and changing it annually. 

The engine should be run for at least 10 minutes every 3 months to prevent carburetor varnish buildup, and the spark plug should be inspected and replaced every 200 hours of use.
