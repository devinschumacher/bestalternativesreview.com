## FAQ


### What is an RBZ driver, and how does it differ from standard drivers?

The RBZ driver represents the latest evolution in golf club technology, specifically designed to optimize distance and forgiveness for both professionals and amateurs. Unlike traditional drivers, it incorporates breakthrough features that enhance ball speed, reduce spin, and maintain straighter flightpaths, even on off-center hits. 

The RBZ driver combines patent-pending technologies that work together to maximize performance. These include a lighter titanium face that flexes more efficiently on impact, optimized clubhead shape for improved aerodynamics, and advanced weighting systems that promote stable, penetrating trajectories. 


### What technology sets the RBZ driver apart from competitors in its category?

The RBZ driver stands out through its unique combination of ultra-light titanium face technology and precisely engineered aerodynamic profiles. The lighter face allows for greater flexibility at impact, while the refined aerodynamics minimize air resistance and promote straighter ball flight. 

Additional features include an adjustable hosel for precise lie angle customization and a stability fin that prevents side-spin during the shot, both of which contribute to a more forgiving, accurate performance compared to similar clubs on the market. 


### How much more carry distance can I expect with an RBZ driver?

Players using RBZ drivers typically report an additional 15-20 yards of carry distance over their previous clubs, with professional testers hitting their longest drives ever using this technology. The improvements come from a combination of increased ball speed and reduced aerodynamic drag. 

While every golfer's results will vary based on skill level and factors like swing speed and technique, the consistent feedback from testing has shown significant carry distance gains with the RBZ driver. 


### What materials are used in the RBZ driver's construction?

The RBZ driver features a three-material construction that maximizes performance while maintaining a traditional clubhead shape. The face is made from ultra-light titanium, which flexes more efficiently during impact to launch the ball faster. The crown and sole are constructed from ultra-high-strength aluminum alloys for durability and stability. 

This combination provides the desired weight distribution for optimal ball flight while keeping the clubhead light enough to maintain the high speeds necessary for maximum distance. 


### Can the RBZ driver be customized for my swing characteristics?

Yes, the RBZ driver offers several customization options to match your unique golf swing. The adjustable hosel allows you to set the lie angle to your preferred pitch, while the stability fin can be aligned in multiple positions to control spin rate and ball flight direction. 

The club also features an adjustable sole weight system that lets you move weights front-to-back for additional launch angle adjustment. These customizable elements ensure the RBZ driver can be precisely tailored to your swing mechanics and performance needs. 


### What is the recommended swing speed for optimal performance with an RBZ driver?

The RBZ driver is designed to perform well across a wide range of swing speeds, with optimal results typically achieved between 75-105 mph. Players with higher swing speeds at or above 105 mph will see the most dramatic improvements in ball speed and carry distance. 

For slower swing speeds, particularly below 75 mph, the RBZ driver still provides significant advantages in forgiveness and ball flight quality. The club's unique face flex technology works effectively at all speeds within its recommended swing range.
