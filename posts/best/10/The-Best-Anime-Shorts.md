### Storytelling & Content

anime shorts vary greatly in their storytelling approach. Some focus on standalone episodes with clear narrative arcs, while others explore character development through ongoing storylines. Consider your preferred pacing: do you prefer quick, punchy episodes, or longer stories with rich character development?
