## FAQ


### What is a fluted side table?

A fluted side table features a decorative, cylindrical indentation or groove along its legs and sometimes its top surface, giving it an elegant, classical appearance. 

These tables combine functional surface space with ornamental elements, often matching the style of chaise lounges, living room sets, or formal dining spaces. 


### What materials are common for fluted side tables?

Common materials include solid wood, metal, and engineered wood. Solid wood options like oak, cherry, and walnut offer lasting quality and natural beauty, while metal and engineered wood provide durability and modern alternatives. 

Finishes range from natural wood tones to polished metal, allowing you to select a look that matches your existing furnishings.
