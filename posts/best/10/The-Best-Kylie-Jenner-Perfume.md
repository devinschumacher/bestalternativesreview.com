This gourmand perfume opens with a mouth-watering combination of hazelnut and pistachio, enhanced by a splash of rum for warmth. The heart reveals soft peony and muguet, creating a captivating balance of sweetness and freshness.

The Kim Kardashian Glam perfume combines juicy watermelon and citrus notes with a soft floral heart of jasmine and rose, before settling into a warm musky base of sandalwood and orris butter. With a generous 3.4 oz bottle, the Eau de Parfum provides a comfortable day-to-evening wear scent that's become a popular addition to Kardashian's fragrance catalog since its 2012 release. While notes of tuberose dominate the fragrance, wearer preferences range from "forgettable" to "fabulous, " with many praising its versatility and lasting power. 


### [Kylie Jenner Red Lips Eau de Parfum](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Kylie+Jenner+Perfume?utm\_term=kylie-jenner-red-lips-eau-de-parfum)

![Kylie Jenner Red Lips Eau de Parfum | Image](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcR78QaU\_Xh3NoHb9rcz2VTgCixaUyzjVds0QM-87x0xX2NYqSytnXMZ769id6Q9CF5NVSuweP\_DKdSP6R2qSEccDKDGKHc2&usqp=CAY)

This luxurious complex fresh woodsy oriental scent from KKW Fragrance beautifully encapsulates the label's signature style. The unique red lip packaging adds a stylish touch to any vanity, though some may find the 1 oz size a bit limiting for daily use. Overall, reviews suggest this fragrance pairs wonderfully with both casual and formal occasions, with many noting its lasting appeal and pleasant dry-down. 


### [Fleur Fatale by Kim Kardashian](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Kylie+Jenner+Perfume?utm\_term=fleur-fatale-by-kim-kardashian)

![Fleur Fatale by Kim Kardashian | Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcQUfrCkcH7s09kLS6XDndJqcGfWWGMPtPAP2w2MRKZhp0fceiM&usqp=CAY)

This feminine fragrance opens with invigorating bergamot, violet, and black currant, evolving into a sophisticated heart of rose, iris, and peony. The luxurious base layers on musk, sandalwood, and amber create an earthy backdrop that lingers long after the top notes have faded. The sophisticated, flower-shaped bottle caught my attention first, but the scent is what keeps drawing me back - a modern take on classic florals that's surprisingly complex for a celebrity fragrance. 


### [Magnolia Bliss Eau de Parfum](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Kylie+Jenner+Perfume?utm\_term=magnolia-bliss-eau-de-parfum)

![Magnolia Bliss Eau de Parfum | Image](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcTzBjMpxAO-S5csk4BEVfPoAsNNMdJt-DZGNrQfrSGISB-hdAAYLtoNgID9wXa5tXAWO5DqXGykTcy2hCgKRoYCWRzv3blq&usqp=CAY)

This feminine floral fragrance from Juliette Has A Gun captures the elegance of a magnolia blossom through rich layers of jasmine, rose, and freesia. The perfectly balanced blend of bergamot and lemon creates an energy that's both fresh and sophisticated, while the base notes of sandalwood and vanilla provide warmth without overwhelming the composition. The result is a scent that evolves beautifully from its initial citrusy freshness into a sultry, magnolia-infused aura that lingers pleasantly throughout the day. 


### [KAYALI Sweet Diamond | Utopia](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Kylie+Jenner+Perfume?utm\_term=kayali-sweet-diamond-utopia)

![KAYALI Sweet Diamond | Utopia | Image](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ5Il7Yr0mgb5LjjiUqCBdCKQ3ephkeJiisNy\_Dfoh5o56WMqJcmiru2M0kuRRwwV1RAWTVBJLkrqSlvvCMpP6DoY3Kx-jCZQ&usqp=CAY)

I absolutely adore the Sweet Diamond scent—the combination of Italian bergamot and sweet rum with hints of cardamom creates an incredibly charming aroma that lingers beautifully. The Utopia vanilla coco is equally delightful, with rich notes of whipped cream and marshmallows that create a heavenly, slightly sweet fragrance. Together, these two scents create endless possibilities for personalizing your signature scent, whether you love to wear them solo or layer them for an unforgettable fragrance experience. 


### [Kayali Lovefest Burning Cherry Eau de Parfum](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Kylie+Jenner+Perfume?utm\_term=kayali-lovefest-burning-cherry-eau-de-parfum)

The Lovefest Burning Cherry fragrance from Kayali captures the complexity of a carefully balanced cherry note, combining tartness with warmth through the use of burning cherry and raspberry upfront, which give way to deeper woods and spices. The addition of Italian bergamot provides a bright contrast to the rich heart notes of praline and rose, while the base delivers a smoky finish with touches of guaiac wood and patchouli. The result is a sophisticated blend that stands as a modern interpretation of classic woody gourmand fragrances.

Imagine a garden of good and evil, where rose and tuberose intertwine in a siren's song of white florals. The Kilian bottle, with its gold-etched Achilles shield and white lacquer finish, becomes a precious keepsake that can be refilled for years to come.

### Heart Notes

After the initial top notes fade, the heart notes emerge, forming the core of the fragrance's scent profile. In Kylie's fragrances, these middle notes might include floral, herbal, or spicy elements. Identifying what you like in these notes can help you select a scent you'll enjoy for longer wear. 


### Base Notes

The base notes in a Kylie Jenner perfume provide lasting character and depth. These heavier scents include elements like vanilla, woods, or musk that linger on skin. Consider how the base notes make you feel, as they significantly impact the overall longevity and character of the fragrance.
