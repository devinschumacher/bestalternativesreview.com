## Buyer's Guide

Knitted weighted blankets combine cozy comfort with deep-pressure stimulation to promote relaxation and better sleep. Understanding their features and benefits helps you choose the right one for your needs. 


### Weight and Size Options

Weighted blankets come in various sizes, from light throw covers to full-sized options, and typically range between 5 and 30 pounds. The general recommendation is to choose a weight that feels heavy but not cumbersome - usually 10-20% of your body weight. Consider the blanket's size to ensure it covers your entire body and arms while providing enough room for movement. 


### Material Quality and Construction

The best knitted weighted blankets use high-quality cotton fabrics with durable stitching. Check for reinforced corners and weighted pockets to prevent unraveling. The fill material should be hypoallergenic and machine washable, with options for removing and cleaning the weight pockets. 


### Temperature Regulation

Weighted blankets can make you feel warm, so choose materials that help prevent overheating. Look for blankets with temperature-regulating properties or lighter weight options for warmer sleepers. The outer layer should allow some airflow while keeping the weight distributed evenly. 


### Additional Features

Some weighted blankets include additional features like zip-off covers, multiple weight adjustment options, or built-in heating elements. Consider these features based on your specific needs and preferences. Ensure any additional elements are safe and enhance rather than compromise the blanket's primary function. 


## FAQ


### What is a knitted weighted blanket?

A knitted weighted blanket combines deep pressure stimulation with warmth and comfort through its layer of weighted beads sewn into the blanket's surface. This weight creates a hugging sensation that can reduce anxiety, improve sleep quality, and provide stress relief. 

The knitting process gives these blankets a soft, cuddly texture that's durable and breathable. Most versions use glass or plastic beads encased in mesh pockets to distribute weight evenly across the blanket. 


### Who should use a weighted blanket?

Weighted blankets are particularly beneficial for individuals with anxiety, ADHD, PTSD, or sleep disorders. They can also help improve sleep quality for anyone who experiences racing thoughts at night. 

While generally safe, it's important to check with a doctor before using a weighted blanket if you have sleep apnea, severe respiratory issues, or are in the last trimester of pregnancy. 


### What sizes are available?

Standard sizes typically range from Twin (75x90 inches) to King (108x90 inches), with Queen and California King options also available. Most manufacturers offer a weight chart to help you choose the right size and weight for your needs. 

Child-specific sizes usually range from 32x42 inches for toddlers to 54x75 inches for older children. Some brands offer customizable sizes and weights for kids. 


### How much should I pay for a high-quality weighted blanket?

Entry-level options typically range from $150 to $250, while premium blankets with additional features like bamboo filling or memory foam pads can cost between $250 and $400. 

Price usually reflects quality materials, weight distribution, and additional comfort features. It's important to balance cost with the blanket's intended use and your specific needs. 


### How long does a weighted blanket last?

With regular use and proper care, a quality weighted blanket typically lasts 5-10 years. The weighted beads and outer shell are the primary components subject to wear. 

Signs that a blanket may need replacement include loose beads, faded color, or wear and tear on the stitching. Regular maintenance like airing out the blanket and checking the bead pockets can extend its lifespan. 


### Can I wash a weighted blanket?

Most weighted blankets are machine washable, but it's important to check the care instructions first. Many manufacturers recommend using a mesh bag during washing to prevent the beads from shifting. 

Airing out the blanket after washing can help prevent the beads from becoming clumped. Refilling bead pockets as needed can maintain the blanket's weight and shape over time.
