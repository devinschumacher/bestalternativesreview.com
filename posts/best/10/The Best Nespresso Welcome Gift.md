## FAQ


### What is included in a typical Nespresso Welcome Gift?

The Nespresso Welcome Gift package usually includes a Nespresso machine, a selection of Nespresso coffee pods, and a bonus box of coffee pods. Popular models in the package include the Nespresso Inissia or Virtissima. 

The gift typically comes with a comprehensive coffee preparation guide and basic maintenance instructions to help new users get started. 


### What size and style options are available for Nespresso machines?

Nespresso machines come in both upright and upright slim styles, with capacities ranging from 14 to 30 Nespresso pods. The smallest models can store 14 pods and brew two cups at once, while larger models hold 30 pods and brew five cups. 

Machine sizes match available pods and coffee cups, with all models supporting the standard pod size. The upright slim series and Inissia model have a more compact design for smaller kitchen spaces. 


### How long does the Nespresso bonus pod box last?

The bonus box of coffee pods typically contains between 50 and 100 pods, depending on the specific model and configuration. These boxes usually contain a mix of flavor profiles, including original coffee and possibly milk-based or hot chocolate options. 

The bonus box brewing period can last from 1 to 2 weeks, allowing users to try multiple coffee flavors before opening the main pod selection. 


### What maintenance is required for Nespresso machines?

Regular maintenance for Nespresso machines includes weekly cleaning of the drip tray and monthly descaling with Nespresso-approved descaling fluid. The coffee pod tray and brew head should be cleaned after each use to prevent buildup. 

Every six months, users should thoroughly clean the brew head assembly and descale the machine according to the manufacturer's instructions to maintain proper performance and prevent mineral buildup. 


### How long does a Nespresso machine last?

With regular maintenance, Nespresso machines typically last between 7 to 10 years. The brewing unit and heating element have the shortest lifespan, lasting around 3 to 5 years before needing replacement. 

Models with more advanced features like automatic steam cleaning have slightly shorter maintenance cycles due to increased usage, while basic models can last closer to 10 years with proper care. 


### What is the return policy for Nespresso machines?

Nespresso machines are typically covered by a 2-year warranty from the date of purchase. During this period, Nespresso covers any manufacturing defects and provides free parts and labor for repairs. 

Beyond the initial warranty period, Nespresso offers a paid maintenance contract where customers can purchase extended coverage for parts and labor. The standard warranty does not cover damage from misuse or accidents.
