To ensure optimal results, provide fresh water and free access to the food throughout the day. Avoid overfeeding, especially for dogs with weight management concerns or health conditions. 


### What are the storage requirements for Performatrin Ultra?

To maintain freshness and quality, store Performatrin Ultra in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. The optimal temperature range is between 65-75°F (18-24°C).
