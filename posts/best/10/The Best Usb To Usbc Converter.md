## Buyer's Guide

A USB-C to USB converter bridging the gap between older USB devices and modern USB-C ports. This guide outlines key considerations to help you select the right converter for your needs. 


### Compatibility

USB-C to USB converters support data transfer and charging through USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 standards. Check if your device requires USB 3.0 for faster speeds or if USB 2.0 is sufficient for your intended use. 


### Power Delivery

Standard converters provide data transfer functionality only. For devices needing USB-C power delivery, look for converters that support the correct voltage and current ratings. Mismatched power delivery may damage your device. 


### Physical Design

USB-C connectors have a different orientation from USB-A, with reversible plugging. Select a converter with sturdy construction and proper orientation markings. Consider the converter's size and shape to ensure it fits your device's available ports. 


### Cable Integration

Some converters offer built-in cables, while others require external USB-C cables. If your device has limited port access, a converter with a cable might be more practical. Alternatively, if you often use multiple devices, investing in a converter with a long cable provides more flexibility.
