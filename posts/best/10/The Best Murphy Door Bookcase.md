## Buyer's Guide

A Murphy door bookcase combines valuable storage with the functionality of a wall-mounted piece of furniture. These compact units fold against the wall when not in use, creating additional floor space while keeping books and accessories organized. When selecting a Murphy door bookcase, consider the following key factors to find the right balance of style, functionality, and storage capacity. 


### Size and Space Requirements

Measure the available wall space carefully before selecting a Murphy door bookcase. Consider the unit's projected dimensions when open, as well as the depth of the space behind the wall. Standard units range from 40 to 72 inches in height, with depths between 12 and 18 inches. Ensure there's enough clearance above and below the unit for maintenance and air circulation. 


### Murder Door Mechanisms

The door mechanism is crucial for smooth operation and durability. Modern Murphy doors use gas struts or tension rods to maintain proper alignment and prevent sagging. Quality mechanisms typically include adjustable hinges and positioning screws for customized fit. Consider the surface finish of the mechanism as well, as it affects both aesthetics and longevity. 


### Storage Options and Design

Storage capacity varies significantly between different models. Shelves can be fixed or adjustable, with some units offering multipletier designs for optimized space utilization. Consider the material construction - solid wood, engineered wood, or metal frames - as it impacts strength and weight capacity. Additionally, examine the visibility features, such as glass panels or open shelving, that enhance room aesthetics while maintaining organization. 


### Installation and Assembly

Installation requirements can range from simple wall-mounting to complex structural modifications. Basic models may include pre-drilled holes and mounting plates, while others necessitate professional installation due to specialized hardware or weight. Read the manufacturer's guidelines carefully to determine if you can handle the assembly process yourself, or if professional help is needed.
