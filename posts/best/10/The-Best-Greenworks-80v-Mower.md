## Buyer's Guide

The Greenworks 80V mower represents a significant advancement in electric lawn care, combining powerful performance with environmentally-friendly operation. Understanding what makes this mower unique and how it compares to traditional gas-powered mowers can help you make an informed purchasing decision. 


### Motor Technology

Unlike traditional mowers that rely on combustion engines, the Greenworks 80V system uses advanced brushless motors. These motors offer several advantages: they're significantly more energy-efficient, deliver smoother operation, and require less maintenance than gas engines. The higher voltage allows for greater cutting performance and longer runtime between charges. 


### Battery and Runtime

When evaluating Greenworks mowers, consider both battery capacity and runtime. A larger battery pack means more runtime, but also affects the mower's weight. Most 80V systems have dual battery packs for extended usage. Runtime typically ranges from 45-75 minutes per charge, which is comparable to many gas mowers but depends heavily on usage conditions. 


### Size and Weight

The Greenworks 80V mower's brushless motor and high-voltage system enable powerful cutting while keeping the overall weight manageable. Most models hover around 50-60 pounds, which many users find reasonable for electric operation. Consider your strength and lifting capacity when selecting a model, as even lightweight electric mowers can be tiring to move regularly. 


### Ergonomics and Features

Ergonomic factors play a crucial role in mowing efficiency and comfort. Look for features like comfortable handles, adjustable height settings, and well-placed controls. Some models offer convenience features like bagging systems or mulching capabilities, which can impact storage space and maintenance requirements. 


## FAQ


### What makes Greenworks 80v mowers different from their other product lines?

Greenworks 80v mowers use a high-voltage lithium-ion battery system that delivers more power and runtime compared to their 60v models. This allows for faster grass cutting and better performance in tougher conditions. 

The 80v platform also features specialized components optimized for higher voltage, including a dedicated motor controller and faster charging capabilities. This results in improved speed, torque, and overall mower efficiency. 


### How long does it take to charge a Greenworks 80v mower battery?

Standard 80v Greenworks mower batteries typically take 4.5 hours to charge from empty to full using the original charger. The professional-grade PM1000 battery requires 5.7 hours of charging. 

Greenworks offers a Quick Charge mode that can achieve an 80% charge in as little as 2 hours, though this will not fully charge the battery. 


### What is the runtime of a Greenworks 80v mower?

Basic Greenworks 80v mowers provide approximately 45 minutes of runtime on a single charge. For comparison, the same model operating at 60v gets about 30 minutes of runtime. 

Pro models like the PM1000 offer extended runtime up to 60 minutes, which is comparable to larger gas mowers in terms of cutting time. 


### Can I use a 60v Greenworks battery in an 80v mower?

Yes, 60v batteries are compatible with Greenworks 80v mowers and can be used as a replacement. However, the 80v battery will remain locked in the mower when using a 60v battery holder. 

The reverse is not possible due to voltage differences, so 80v batteries cannot be used in 60v mowers. 


### What safety features are included in Greenworks 80v mowers?

All 80v Greenworks mowers come equipped with an automatic shutdown feature that stops the engine if the cutting height exceeds the deck height by more than 1 inch. This prevents damage to the mower and protects the operator. 

The mowers also include a forward/reverse safety switch, electrical disconnect key, and blade brake system that stops the blades in under 3 seconds after cutting. 


### How do Greenworks 80v mowers compare in terms of maintenance?

Greenworks 80v mowers generally require less frequent maintenance compared to gas-powered mowers. The battery system eliminates the need for oil changes and spark plug replacements. 

Regular maintenance includes checking the blade, mower deck belts (if applicable), and ensuring all electrical connections are secure. The battery should be inspected for proper voltage levels during seasonal starts.
