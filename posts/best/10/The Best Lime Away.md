## FAQ


### What are Lime Away products?

Lime Away products are a range of natural wood care solutions. They're designed to clean, protect, and preserve wood surfaces using eco-friendly ingredients that prevent common wood problems like cracking, warping, and splitting. 

The products are made from natural ingredients like citrus oils, food-grade waxes, and plant-based emollients, making them safe for use on both indoor and outdoor wood surfaces without harsh chemicals. 


### How do Lime Away products work?

Lime Away products contain natural oils and waxes that penetrate wood fibers, creating a protective barrier against moisture and damage. The citrus oils in the products also help to clean and renew wood surfaces, while the emollients soften and protect the wood's natural integrity. 

These products work through a combination of cleaning, conditioning, and protective effects, helping to restore wood's natural beauty while preventing future damage. 


### What types of wood surfaces can I use Lime Away products on?

Lime Away products are suitable for most wood surfaces, including hardwood floors, furniture, decks, and outdoor structures like gazebos and fencing. They work best on untreated, unsealed wood and can be used on both indoor and outdoor applications. 

The products are not recommended for use on painted or varnished wood surfaces, as they are designed to work with the wood's natural untreated state to provide protection. 


### How do I use Lime Away products?

Using Lime Away products is straightforward. Apply the product using a clean cloth, working in small sections. For cleaning, wipe down the surface, then apply a thin even coat for conditioning. Depending on the product, you may need to allow it to dry or cure before reapplication or exposure to moisture. 

Always follow the specific instructions for each product, as application methods and drying times may vary between different products in the Lime Away range. 


### How long does Lime Away protection last?

The longevity of Lime Away protection depends on several factors, including the specific product used, environmental conditions, and the frequency of application. Generally, the products provide protection for 6-12 months with proper application and maintenance. 

Regular reapplication, especially in high-traffic areas or outdoor settings, helps maintain consistent protection. Factors like direct sunlight, moisture exposure, and foot traffic can affect how long the protection lasts. 


### Are Lime Away products safe for pets and children?

Lime Away products are made from natural ingredients and are generally considered safe for use around pets and children. However, they should be used and stored out of reach of pets and children, and pets should be kept away from treated wood surfaces until the product has fully cured. 

If you notice any adverse reactions or if your pet consumes any of the product, contact your veterinarian or poison control center immediately for guidance.
