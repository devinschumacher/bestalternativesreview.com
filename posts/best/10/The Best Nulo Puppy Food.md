## Buyer's Guide

Choosing the right puppy food can significantly impact your pet's health and development. Nulo offers several specialized formulas designed for growing puppies, focusing on high-quality ingredients and complete nutrition. 


### Essential Nutritional Requirements

Puppy food should provide the right balance of protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals to support rapid growth. High-quality proteins from animal sources are crucial for muscle development. Healthy fats supply essential omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Carbohydrates should come from complex sources like sweet potatoes or chickpeas. The food must also contain all necessary vitamins and minerals for optimal growth and immune function. 


### Ingredient Quality and Source

Nutritious ingredients should be whole, recognizable, and of high quality. Avoid artificial preservatives, colors, or flavors. The first few ingredients should consist of meats or high-quality proteins, followed by nutrient-dense vegetables and fruits. Look for whole-food ingredients rather than grain-by-products or meals. 


### Puppy-Specific Formulas

High-quality puppy foods formulated specifically for Nulo's active lifestyle will contain higher protein levels for muscle development and specific nutrients to support rapid growth. These formulas often include DHA for brain development and calcium for skeletal growth. The food should also support immune function through added antioxidants and immune-supportive ingredients. 


### Feeding Guidelines and Transition Tips

Always transition puppies to new food gradually over 7-10 days to prevent digestive upset. Start with a small amount of new food mixed with their current diet, increasing the proportion daily. Follow recommended feeding amounts based on weight and activity level, adjusting as needed to maintain optimal body condition. Consult your veterinarian for personalized feeding recommendations. 


## FAQ


### What makes Nulo puppy food different from other brands?

Nulo uses fresh ingredients with no artificial ingredients, fillers, or preservatives. Their meals contain real meat as the first ingredient, providing high-quality protein essential for your puppy's growth and development. 

Unlike many other puppy foods that rely heavily on corn or wheat, Nulo's recipes maintain a balanced carbohydrate profile using sweet potatoes, tapioca, and pea fiber, ensuring comprehensive nutrition without unnecessary fillers. 


### Are Nulo meals suitable for all puppies?

Yes, Nulo meals are formulated to support the nutritional needs of all life stages, including growth. The company recommends their meals for puppies, as well as for pregnant and nursing mothers, and growing or adult dogs. 

However, if your puppy has specific dietary requirements or health concerns, it's important to consult with your veterinarian before switching food brands.

### What's the difference between Nulo's grain-free and grain-included meals?

Nulo offers both grain-free and grain-included options. Grain-free meals omit traditional carbohydrates like rice and oats, replacing them with alternative starch sources like tapioca and pea fiber. This is suitable for dogs with grain sensitivities. 

Grain-included meals maintain a balanced carbohydrate profile with traditional sources of starch, making them a good choice for dogs without specific grain sensitivities. Both versions contain real meat as the primary ingredient. 


### How long does Nulo puppy food last once opened?

After opening, Nulo meals should be stored in a cool, dry place and refrigerated within 24 hours. The food maintains freshness for up to 4 days when refrigerated properly, allowing ample time to finish the opened package safely.

### What size options are available for Nulo puppy meals?

Nulo offers three main meal sizes: 
1.9 lb (850g), 4.2 lb (1.9kg), and 14 lb (6.4kg) bags. The company recommends feeding based on your puppy's specific nutritional needs, weight, and activity level. 

They provide portion guidelines on their website to help you determine the appropriate serving size for your puppy, considering factors like age, breed size, and activity level.
