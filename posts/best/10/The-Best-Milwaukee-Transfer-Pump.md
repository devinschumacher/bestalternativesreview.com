## Buyer's Guide

Milwaukee transfer pumps are designed for efficiently moving liquids between containers. These versatile tools find applications in residential and commercial settings, from boat bilge pumping to construction site drainage. Understanding the key specifications and capabilities of these pumps will help you select the right tool for your specific needs. 


### Max Flow Rate

The flow rate determines how quickly the pump can move liquid. Higher flow rates are essential for handling larger volumes or faster drainage needs. For most applications, consider a pump with a flow rate between 100 and 200 gallons per minute. 


### Head Capacity

Head capacity measures how high the pump can lift liquid, often expressed in feet. This is critical for managing liquids at different heights. If you need to pump to a elevated tank or over obstacles, choose a pump with a head capacity that exceeds your height requirement by 10-20 feet. 


### Power Source

Milwaukee transfer pumps come in both electric and gas-powered versions. Electric pumps are quieter and easier to maintain but require ready access to electricity. Gas pumps offer greater mobility and independence but need regular fuel refills. Consider your usage patterns and accessibility when choosing a power source. 


### Additional Features

Look for pumps with adjustable suction depths and check valves to prevent backflow. Some models include built-in strainers to protect against debris. Consider whether you need an insulated housing for cold environments or a portable design with wheels for easy relocation.
