### [Studio Six-Drawer Dresser](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Horizontal+Dresser?utm\_term=studio-six-drawer-dresser)

## Buyer's Guide

Horizontal dressers transform cluttered spaces into organized havens with their generous storage capacity and sleek designs. From slim linen closets to spacious master bedrooms, these multi-drawer units maximize vertical space while maintaining clean lines and modern aesthetics. 


### Storage Capacity and Design

Horizontal dressers range from compact 3-drawer options ideal for guest rooms to expansive 9-drawer configurations for walk-in closets. When selecting a size, measure your available space and consider how many items you need to store (shirts, socks, folded clothing, etc. ). Commonly ignored, the depth of your clothing items affects how many can fit in each drawer. 

![Horizontal-Dresser-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Horizontal-Dresser-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### MATERIALS AND CONSTRUCTION

Wood remains the premium choice, offering both natural and engineered options. Solid wood provides durability but requires more maintenance, while engineered wood gives you the appearance of hardwood at a lower cost with less upkeep. For budgets and apartments, MDF (Medium-Density Fiberboard) construction offers affordability and decent performance with proper sealing. 

Metal frames add strength and modern appeal but may scratch more easily than wood. Composite materials blend durability with weight reduction but might show indentations under heavy items. Always check construction details for added stability like internal bracing and reinforced corners. 


### DRAWER DETAILS

Quality horizontal dressers feature full-extension glide mechanisms across all drawers, not just the top two. This ensures smooth access to the far back of each compartment. Soft-close mechanisms reduce noise and prevent damage to contents, especially valuable items like jewelry or fragile glasses. 

Organizational elements like dividers, stacked slotted drawers for ties, and specialty compartments for belts improve functionality. Ensure drawers have adequate depth for their intended use: at least 11 inches for shirts, 6 inches for socks, and 14 inches for sweaters. 

![Horizontal-Dresser-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Horizontal-Dresser-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### MISCELLANEOUS CONSIDERATIONS

Hidden wheels beneath the frame enable easy relocation while protecting floor surfaces from scratches. Quality hardware, including solid brass pulls, extends the life of your dresser and adds a touch of class. Consider the finishing process: UV-cured lacquer provides superior durability to clear coats. 

Think about future-proofing your purchase by selecting contemporary styles that complement various decor schemes. While trends change, a well-crafted horizontal dresser should maintain its appeal for years with proper care and modest updating.

### How should you measure for a horizontal dresser?

Measure the available wall space, ensuring you have 36 inches of floor space plus the dresser's length (48-60 inches) and height (30-36 inches). Consider the total footprint, including the space required for opening doors or drawers. 

Measure the height of your room's furniture and ceiling to ensure proper clearance and balance with the new dresser.
