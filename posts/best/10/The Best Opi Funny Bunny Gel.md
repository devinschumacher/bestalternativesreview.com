### Application and Finish

These gels typically have a slightly tacky consistency when first applied, requiring a specific type of UV/LED nail lamp for proper curing. The final finish tends to be smooth and slightly glossy, though some users may notice a slight tackiness that requires a touch of topcoat for optimal shine. 


### Longevity and Maintenance

Once cured, the gel polish usually lasts between 2-3 weeks, comparable to standard gel manicures. To maintain the best condition, avoid soaking your hands in water and remove the polish with a proper gel removal solution rather than harsh chemicals.

### Considerations for Use

Selecting the right shade depends on your skin tone and personal preference for pastel or bolder colors. Some users with sensitive skin may experience minor irritation, so it's recommended to perform a patch test before applying to your nails. 


## FAQ

![OPI-Funny-Bunny-Gel-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/OPI-Funny-Bunny-Gel-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is Opi Funny Bunny Gel?

Opi Funny Bunny Gel is a nail polish featuring a playful bunny design that appears after application. The base color is clear, and the design becomes visible once the polish is dry. 

The gel formula provides long-lasting wear while maintaining chip-resistant quality, similar to traditional gel polish. 


### How do I apply Opi Funny Bunny Gel?

Application is similar to regular gel polish. The base coat, design color, and top coat are applied using standard gel techniques, followed by UV or LED curing per the manufacturer's instructions. 

After application, the design may fade slightly during the first day due to natural drying processes. This is normal and does not affect the overall quality of the polish.

### How long does Opi Funny Bunny Gel last?

With proper application and care, Opi Funny Bunny Gel typically lasts 2-3 weeks before noticeable wear. 

As with any gel nail product, long-term exposure to water and harsh chemicals can shorten wear time. 


### Can Opi Funny Bunny Gel be used on natural nails?

Opi recommends using natural nails for this product due to the specific curing requirements and potential for damage to damaged or brittle nails. 

Always test new products on a small area first to ensure compatibility with your nail type.

### How do I remove Opi Funny Bunny Gel?

Standard gel polish removal techniques apply. The polish can be removed with gel polish remover or a third-party product designed for gel nail removal. 

Soak-off systems may work, but results may vary. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for best results. 


### Does Opi Funny Bunny Gel contain formaldehyde?

Opi Funny Bunny Gel is formaldehyde-free, making it a safer option for those concerned about formaldehyde exposure in nail products. 

The formula contains other common nail polish ingredients like toluene and camphor, which are typically present in gel and acrylic nail products.
