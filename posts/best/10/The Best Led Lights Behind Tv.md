The Govee TV Backlight 3 Lite packs some handy features into a reasonably priced package, like fixing fish-eye distortion and handling ultra-thin TVs with grace. While it's not perfect—a single camera setup and fewer LEDs per section than higher-end models limit its precision slightly—it nails the basics of color accuracy and response time. The included white LED really shines during daytime viewing, though installation can get a bit fussy depending on your TV's design.

## Buyer's Guide

LED lights behind a TV can enhance your viewing experience through dynamic lighting effects and environmental illumination. Understanding the key aspects of these products will help you select the right features for your space and preferences. 


### Color Options and Temperature

LED TV backlights come in various color temperatures, typically measured in Kelvin (K). Warm white (2700K-3000K) creates a cozy, candlelit ambiance, while cool white (4000K-6500K) offers a more energizing, daylight-like illumination. Consider your room's existing lighting and personal preference when choosing the color temperature.

### Color Control and Effects

Modern LED TV lighting supports color variation through RGB (Red, Green, Blue) capabilities. These systems allow for millions of color combinations and can synchronize with content for enhanced visual experiences. Look for products with smooth color transitions and adjustable brightness levels to match your viewing conditions. 


### Installation and Mounting

LED TV backlights require specific installation considerations. The mounting method must support the light's weight and provide even distribution of pressure. Some models attach directly to the TV frame, while others use clips or adhesive strips. Ensure your TV stand or mounting structure can accommodate the additional weight and dimensions.

### Energy Efficiency and Lifespan

LED technology inherently offers high efficiency and long lifespan compared to traditional lighting solutions. Look for products with a stated lifespan of 30,000 hours or more, which equates to over 25 years of continuous operation. Energy efficiency ratings can help you compare consumption levels, but remember that brighter installations will use more power. 


## FAQ

![Led-Lights-Behind-Tv-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Led-Lights-Behind-Tv-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What types of LED lights work well behind TVs?

Most LED strip lights with a non-glare finish work well behind TVs. Look for lights with a color temperature between 3000K and 5000K for a natural white light that matches your room's lighting. Avoid LED tape with very warm tones (under 2700K) that could wash out your TV picture. 

Choose lights with a minimum 3000 lumen output per linear foot for adequate illumination. Check if the lights are dimmable via standard wall dimmers, which work with most LED strips. 


### How do I calculate the right LED light length for my TV?

Determine the viewing distance from your TV to the wall behind it (typically 1.5 to 2 times the screen diagonal). The recommended light length is usually between 70-90% of this distance, ensuring adequate ambient light while preventing direct TV reflection. 

For larger rooms or higher ceiling heights, you can use up to 110% of the viewing distance. Always account for potential movement when mounting - allow extra length for adjustments.

### What's the best way to install LED lights behind a TV?

Install a power strip rated for LED lighting near the TV or in a convenient location. Use cable clips and flex conduit to route wires between the power source and LED lights, keeping cables concealed and secure. 

Mount LED strips using adhesive mounting tape rather than drilling. Space clips evenly (every 12-18 inches) to distribute weight, especially for heavier LED strips. Consider adding a trim plate behind the TV for a clean finish. 


### How do I connect multiple LED strips behind a TV?

Series connections work best for LED strips under 16 feet. Connect the positive terminal of one strip to the negative terminal of the next for longer runs. For shorter runs, use parallel connections by connecting multiple strips between the power source and neutral terminal. 

Use a LED-compatible power supply with a constant voltage output. If running multiple strips, ensure the power supply has enough wattage (typically 1 watt per linear foot) to handle the total length of lights. 

![Led-Lights-Behind-Tv-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Led-Lights-Behind-Tv-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Why are some LED lights behind TV walls warmer than others?

LED strips with lower color temperature (under 3000K) appear warmer and more amber. This happens when the LED chips used produce less blue light spectrum. For a consistent look with your TV, choose lights with a color temperature matching your display's calibration settings. 

These warmer lights are often indicated by "soft white" branding. If you prefer a cooler look, select LED strips with a color temperature above 4000K, which have a more neutral appearance similar to daylight. 


### Can LED lights behind TV damage my display?

Most modern LED lights behind TV are designed to safely illuminate the wall behind the screen without interference. However, very close proximity (<6 inches) or extremely high brightness levels may cause visible reflections or glow effects on the TV screen. 

To minimize risks, keep LED strips at least 6 inches away from the TV edge. Use diffusers or light filters if reflections are problematic. Always check LED strip specs for viewing distance recommendations before installation.
