## Buyer's Guide

A table top griddle combines spacious cooking surfaces with non-stick properties for versatile breakfast and cooking options. When selecting a griddle, consider the cooking surface size, heating elements, temperature control features, and non-stick coating quality to find the right balance of performance and durability. 


### Cooking Surface Size

The primary factor in a griddle's effectiveness is its cooking surface area. Common sizes range from 600 to 1800 square inches, with larger surfaces suitable for family breakfasts or commercial use. Consider the space available and the number of items you typically cook at once when choosing the appropriate size. 


### Heating Elements

Modern griddles use either electric or gas heating elements. Electric griddles offer consistent heat distribution and are easier to control, while gas griddles provide quicker temperature adjustments and outdoor compatibility. The heating elements should cover the entire surface for even cooking and have adjustable temperature controls for different recipes. 


### Non-Stick Coating

High-quality non-stick coatings ensure easy food release and simplify cleaning. Look for PTFE- or PFOA-free ceramic coatings that maintain their properties through frequent use. The coating should cover the entire surface and last through multiple seasons of use without chipping or peeling. 


### Additional Features

Consider extra features that enhance usability, such as adjustable height settings, drip trays, or built-in grease management systems. Safety features like automatic shut-off in the case of overheating or empty-pan detection also contribute to long-term reliability and peace of mind during use.
