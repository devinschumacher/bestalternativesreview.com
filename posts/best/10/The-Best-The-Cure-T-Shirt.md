### Official Authenticity

Authentic Cure t-shirts carry official branding and are produced by recognized license holders. Genuine items typically feature precise printing, high-quality fabric, and proper sizing information. Verify authenticity through official online stores or authorized retailers. 


### Material Quality

The t-shirt's material composition affects both comfort and longevity. Common choices include cotton blends and polyester options.

Cure t-shirts often run true to size, but it's advisable to check specific sizing charts. Popular fits range from slim to relaxed, so consider whether you prefer a close or loose silhouette. Chest measurements are commonly used to determine proper sizing.
