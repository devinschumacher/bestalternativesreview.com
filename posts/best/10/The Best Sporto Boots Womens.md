### Your Foot Shape and Size

The right arch support can prevent foot fatigue during sports activities. Look for boots with dual-density cushioning that provides both heel support and midsole comfort. The insole should feel firm but offer some give underfoot.

### How long will the boots last?

With proper care and regular use, Sporto boots typically last 2-3 years, depending on the frequency and intensity of use. Factors like terrain type, weather conditions, and personal maintenance habits also influence longevity. 

Key to extending boot life is consistent cleaning and drying after each use, proper storage in a cool, dry place, and regular inspection for signs of wear or damage. Regularly checking for loose stitching, cracks in the outsole, or wear patterns helps identify potential issues before they become problematic. 


### What maintenance requirements do these boots have?

Regular maintenance helps preserve the performance and appearance of Sporto boots. After each use, wipe the exterior with a damp cloth to remove dirt and debris. Allow the boots to air dry completely before storing. 

Apply a waterproofing spray to the leather upper every 3-6 months, especially before extended use in wet conditions. For deeper cleaning, use mild soap and water, then thoroughly dry before reapplying the waterproofing treatment.
