Looking for the perfect Lego display shelf? Our comprehensive guide walks you through key features and considerations to help you find the right storage solution for your collection. 


### Available Sizes and Styles

Lego display shelves come in various sizes to fit different spaces and collection needs. Common styles include wall-mounted units, floor-standing displays, and open shelving options. Consider your available space and desired display height when selecting a shelf size.

## FAQ


### What types of Lego display shelves are available?

Legrand offers a wide range of display solutions, including floor-standing units, wall-mounted shelves, and open displays. Their products are designed to accommodate various Lego sets and sizes. 

Some popular options include the Lego sorting tray systems, which help organize small elements, and modular shelving units that can be customized to your space. 


### What materials are Lego display shelves made from?

Legrand's display shelves are constructed from high-quality materials to ensure durability and longevity. The primary materials include MDF for the shelves, steel frames for stability, and gloss acrylic for clear display windows. 

Additional features often include plastic inserts for organization and metal brackets for wall mounting, all designed to protect both your display items and the shelf structure. 


### How much weight can Lego display shelves support?

The weight capacity of Legrand's shelves varies by model. Floor-standing units typically support 50-100 pounds per shelf, while wall-mounted options range from 30-60 pounds per shelf, depending on the specific design and materials. 

Always refer to the product specifications for accurate weight capacity information, and distribute heavy items evenly across multiple shelves to maintain stability. 


### What maintenance is required for Lego display shelves?

Basic maintenance for Legrand's display shelves includes regular dusting with a microfiber cloth and occasional cleaning of window surfaces with a mild glass cleaner. Avoid using abrasive materials or harsh chemicals that could damage the protective coatings. 

Check for loose bolts or wobbly shelves annually and tighten as needed to maintain proper stability. Wall-mounted shelves should be re-levelled and bolts checked every few years to prevent loosening.

Legrand offers a variety of accessory options to enhance your display, including shelf organizers, clear storage boxes, and transport trays. Their sorting tray system is particularly popular for managing small Lego pieces.

### How do I choose the right Lego display shelf?

When selecting a display shelf, consider the size of your collection, available space, and preferred display style. Measure your space carefully and leave some extra room for walkability around shelving units. 

Think about how you want to display your Lego sets – open shelving works well for visible collections, while closed cabinets offer better dust protection. Consider the base material's durability and the shelf design's stability before making a purchase.
