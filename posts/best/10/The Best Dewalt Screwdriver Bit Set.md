## FAQ


### What are the key features of Dewalt's top screwdriver bit sets?

Dewalt's premium screwdriver bit sets feature high-quality steel construction with precision-milled edges for clean hole entry. Each set includes a variety of bit sizes and shapes, including Philips, flat-head, Torx, and hex bits, to handle all common screw head types. 

The bits are stored in durable plastic containers with clear organizers that keep the collection tidy and accessible. Most sets also include magnetic attachments to help secure the bits during use and prevent loss. 


### What bit sizes are included in these sets?

Standard sets contain bits ranging from 1.5mm to 6mm in size, while larger sets may extend down to 1mm and up to 8mm. Specialized sets may include metric sizes like 2mm, 2.5mm, and 3mm, in addition to the more common fractional sizes. 

The included Torx bits typically range from T4 to T20, while hex bits usually come in sizes 2-3/64" through 1/4". Additional specialty bits like Allen, star, or combo driver bits may be available in some sets. 


### How durable are these screwdriver bits?

The heat-treated steel used in Dewalt bits resists deformation and maintains its sharpness through repeated use. Most sets feature full-length shanks that prevent stripping when facing tough screws. 

However, frequent use on hardened materials like cast iron may cause premature wear. Bits should be inspected regularly for chipping or cracking, and replaced when necessary to maintain proper functionality. 


### What's the difference between standard and magnetic bits?

Standard bits have plain shanks that require regular handling to maintain their orientation. Magnetic bits feature a metal tip that automatically aligns with the screw head, reducing the need for manual reorientation. 

Magnetic bits can save time and reduce frustration during multitasking, but may lose their magnetic properties over time with frequent use. They also require slightly more torque to remove the magnetic tip when changing bits. 


### How should I maintain my Dewalt screwdriver bits?

After use, clean each bit with a dry cloth to remove any debris or residue. Store them in their original container, keeping similar sizes together for easy access. 

Avoid storing bits in damp environments or exposed to extreme temperatures. Replace any damaged or worn bits promptly to maintain optimal tool performance. 


### Are these bits compatible with all Dewalt drivers?

Most Dewalt bit sets are designed to work with their Quick Change system, requiring no adapters for standard sizes. Newer sets may include specialized bits for their R2 and R3 drivers. 

Some older bits may require specific adapters for certain driver models. Always check the compatibility chart provided by Dewalt to ensure proper fit for your specific tool.
