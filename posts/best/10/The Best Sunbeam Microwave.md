## Buyer's Guide

Microwaves from Sunbeam offer convenient heating and warming capabilities. Understanding their features helps in selecting the right model for your kitchen needs. 


### Power and Cooking Performance

Higher wattage typically means faster heating. Standard residential models range from 700 to 1200 watts. Consider a higher wattage for defrosting large items or reheating large quantities of food quickly. 


### Convenience Features

Look for easy-to-clean interior surfaces and interior lights to see your food. Reheating bars can save time by automatically setting the correct power level and time for common foods. Some models include built-in recipe programs for quick, hassle-free reheating. 


### Sizing and Space Considerations

Measure your cabinet depth to ensure the microwave will fit. Standard sizes range from 17 to 24 inches wide. Consider models with reversible doors if your cabinet has limited wall space. 


### Additional Features

Check for digital displays for precise temperature control. Some models include USB ports for charging devices or mobile car adaptors for in-car use. Water boiling and popcorn pop features can be convenient for quick food preparation. 


## FAQ


### What features do Sunbeam microwaves typically offer?

Sunbeam microwaves usually come with standard features like turntable rotation, power defrosting, and multiple cooking modes. Many models also include LED display screens and programmable settings for precise cooking control. 

Higher-end models may offer additional features such as convection baking, rapid cooking functions, and smart cooking programs that adjust cooking times based on the food being heated. 


### How do I properly clean the interior of my Sunbeam microwave?

The interior should be cleaned monthly using a mixture of water and mild detergent. For tough stains, use a solution of water and vinegar or baking soda paste. Always unplug the microwave before cleaning and allow it to cool completely. 

Wipe the interior surfaces and turntable with a soft cloth. For easier maintenance, consider using microwave-safe sanitizing bags with water and vinegar or baking soda to eliminate odors and clean the interior simultaneously. 


### What is the typical cooking capacity of Sunbeam microwaves?

Most Sunbeam microwaves have a cooking capacity between 1.1 to 1.8 cubic feet. This size allows for cooking individual meals or small batches of food. The larger capacity models are suitable for families or households that need to heat multiple dishes at once. 

The cooking cavity dimensions vary slightly between models, but generally, a 1.2 cubic foot microwave has interior dimensions of approximately 15.5 inches wide by 15.4 inches deep by 17.1 inches high. 


### Can I use metal containers in my Sunbeam microwave?

Never use metal containers in the microwave as they can cause sparks and damage. Sunbeam recommends using microwave-safe containers made of glass, ceramic, or microwave-safe plastic. 

If you have an older model with a magnetic door seal, avoid using metal containers as they can damage the seal. Always check the manufacturer's guidelines for specific model compatibility. 


### How much electricity does a Sunbeam microwave consume?

The energy consumption of Sunbeam microwaves varies by model, but most use between 600 and 1200 watts. The average cost to operate a microwave for one hour is between $0.05 and $0.10, depending on your local electricity rates. 

Energy-efficient models may consume less power, while convection features or rapid cooking modes can increase energy usage. The microwave's power consumption is listed on the product specifications or in the user manual. 


### What should I consider when purchasing a Sunbeam microwave?

When selecting a Sunbeam microwave, consider the cooking capacity needed for your household size, available countertop space, and any specific features you require such as convection baking or rapid cooking. 

Check for energy efficiency ratings, ease of cleaning features, and simple controls for daily use. Additionally, verify the warranty period and availability of spare parts before making a purchase decision.
