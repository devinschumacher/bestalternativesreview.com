When applied faithfully morning and night, users report visible results in just weeks—from thicker, fuller lashes to natural-looking eyebrow growth. While some experience minor sensitivity, many find it worth the gentle irritation for the potential to transform thinning hair on both brows and lashes.

## Buyer's Guide

The Ordinary Hair Serum has garnered significant attention due to its potent active ingredients and affordable pricing. This guide examines key factors to consider when selecting a hair serum, helping you make an informed choice that meets your specific styling and hair care needs. 


### Key Ingredients and Their Benefits

The effectiveness of hair serums largely depends on their active ingredients. Common beneficial components include alcohol-free formulas to prevent scalp irritation, biotin for strengthened hair strands, and vitamin E to promote scalp health. Look for products that address your specific hair concerns, whether it's reducing frizz, providing heat protection, or enhancing shine. 


### Application and Usage

Proper application technique can significantly impact the product's effectiveness. Most hair serums require a small amount - typically 3-5 drops - applied to the fingertips for distribution. Apply to dry hair before styling or use as a finishing touch on damp hair. Consider the product's absorption properties; some should be worked through the scalp and ends for maximum benefit, while others serve best as a lightweight top layer. 


### Hair Type Compatibility

Not all hair types respond the same way to serums. Those with oily scalps may want to avoid heavy, greasy formulas, while dry or damaged hair benefits from more nourishing ingredients. Test the product on a small section of hair before full application to ensure it suits your specific needs and doesn't cause adverse reactions such as scalp irritation or excessive oiliness. 


### Care and Storage

Proper storage extends a hair serum's shelf life and maintains its effectiveness. Store the product in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight and heat sources, which can degrade the active ingredients. Always use clean hands or a fresh applicator bottle when dispensing the serum to prevent contamination. Regularly check the product's texture and smell for any signs of spoilage before use. 


## FAQ


### What is The Ordinary Hair Serum?

The Ordinary Hair Serum is a concentrated formula designed to address specific hair concerns. This lightweight treatment serum can help with everything from improving shine and reducing frizz to promoting healthy, manageable locks. 

Each bottle contains potent, science-backed ingredients that work at high concentrations to deliver noticeable results. Unlike traditional hair care products, The Ordinary serums are specifically formulated for targeted hair issues rather than providing general care. 


### How does The Ordinary Hair Serum work?

The serums contain no emulsifiers, so they sit on the surface of the hair shaft rather than penetrating deep into the cuticle. This allows the active ingredients to create a protective shield that reduces damage from environmental factors like heat styling tools and pollution. 

The lightweight formula makes it ideal for daily use without leaving residue or weighing hair down. Unlike other hair serums that may contain multiple moisturizing ingredients, these formulas focus on just a few key active components for maximum effect. 


### What makes The Ordinary Hair Serums different from regular hair products?

Unlike traditional hair care products that often contain numerous conditioning and texturizing ingredients, The Ordinary serums specialize in delivering high concentrations of a single active ingredient. This targeted approach means fewer ingredients overall, typically resulting in a more natural appearance and feel. 

The Ordinary also practices ingredient transparency, clearly stating the precise concentration of each active compound. While many other hair serums keep their formulas confidential, this approach allows users to make informed decisions based on their specific needs and concerns. 


### What ingredients are commonly found in The Ordinary Hair Serums?

The most common active ingredients in The Ordinary hair serums include dimethicone, which creates a water-resistant barrier on the hair shaft, and argan oil, which helps repair damage and improve shine. These formulas typically feature just one or two key ingredients in high concentrations. 

Other frequently used ingredients include squalane for its conditioning properties and PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone) to help control frizz. Unlike some hair serums that list dozens of ingredients, each formula focuses on a few key compounds to achieve its specific benefit. 


### Are The Ordinary Hair Serums safe for all hair types?

While The Ordinary formulas are generally well-tolerated, it's important to note that everyone's hair is unique. If you have very fine or dry hair, you may find that some of these serums make your hair feel greasy or heavy. It's recommended to start with small amounts and monitor your hair's reaction. 

Most formulas are suitable for all hair types, including color-treated hair, but individuals with severe allergies or sensitivities should patch test before regular use. The Ordinary recommends performing a patch test on a small section of scalp before applying the serum to your entire head. 


### Can I use The Ordinary Hair Serums with other hair products?

The Ordinary serums are designed to work well with most existing hair care routines. They contain no harsh chemicals that would interfere with other products, making them compatible with both natural and chemically treated hair. However, if you're using multiple hair treatments, apply The Ordinary serum last in your routine to ensure optimal absorption and effectiveness. 

Most users find that these serums enhance the performance of their existing hair care products rather than conflicting with them. The non-greasy, non-oily nature of these serums makes them easy to incorporate into any hair care regimen without causing buildup or residue.
