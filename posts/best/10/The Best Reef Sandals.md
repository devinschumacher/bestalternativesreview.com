## Buyer's Guide

Reef sandals combine style and functionality for both casual wear and water-based activities. Understanding their key features will help you find the perfect pair for your needs. 


### Construction and Materials

High-quality reef sandals feature durable synthetic materials like EVA foam or rubber, sometimes reinforced with polyester straps. Quality craftsmanship ensures secure stitching and stable soles. 


### Water-Retention Features

Many reef sandals include technical materials that resist water absorption. This keeps the sandals light and comfortable during long beach days or water activities. 


### Sizing and Fit

Proper sizing is crucial as reef sandals have a wider, more relaxed fit compared to traditional footwear. Try them on and mold the straps to your preferred tightness for the best fit. 


### Comfort Features

Look for sandals with strategic padding and moisture-wicking materials to prevent blisters during extended wear. Quality models also offer better arch support than standard flip-flops. 


## FAQ


### What makes Reef sandals unique?

Reef sandals stand out in the market with their signature footbed technology, the LFC (Lower Foot Control) System. This system helps prevent blisters and hot spots by providing proper arch support and reducing foot movement within the sandal. 

The company's commitment to sustainability is also noteworthy, as their shoes are made from 100% recycled materials, including both the upper and sole components. 


### Are Reef sandals suitable for all foot types?

Reef sandals offer several widths (A, B, C, DD) to accommodate different foot shapes, making them suitable for most people. However, those with extremely wide feet might need to check the specific width options for the style they're interested in. 

The LFC System provides good arch support, but individuals with very high arches or flat feet may want to consider trying on a pair before purchasing to ensure proper fit and comfort. 


### How durable are Reef sandals?

Reef sandals are known for their durability, with many customers reporting 3-5 years of regular use from a single pair. The recycled rubber soles and polyester upper materials hold up well to daily wear and tear. 

While they are built to last, the sandals can show signs of wear over time, particularly on the soles where the foot strikes the ground most often. Regular maintenance through proper cleaning and drying can extend their lifespan. 


### What colors and styles are available?

Reef offers a wide range of colors and patterns across their collection, from classic earthy tones to bright tropical designs. The selection varies by style, with some offering more color options than others. 

Styles range from casual everyday footwear to water-resistant options for beach activities, allowing customers to choose based on their specific needs and preferences. 


### How should I clean and maintain my Reef sandals?

Regular maintenance can help preserve the condition of your Reef sandals. Wipe them down with a damp cloth when they get dirty, then air dry them completely to prevent mold and mildew growth. 

A soft-bristled brush can be used to remove stubborn sand or dirt from the upper material and soles. For deeper cleaning, you can use a mild soap solution, but always test a small, hidden area first to ensure compatibility with the materials. 


### How do I know which size to choose?

Reef recommends measuring your foot (including your arch length) and comparing it to their size chart. Their sizing runs slightly smaller than US standards, so it's often better to choose the next size up. 

Try on a pair in your selected size and walk around a store to ensure proper fit and comfort. The sandal should feel snug but not tight, with about a half-inch of space between your longest toe and the front of the shoe.
