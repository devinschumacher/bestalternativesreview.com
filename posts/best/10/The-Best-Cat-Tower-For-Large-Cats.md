## Buyer's Guide

Cat towers offer vertical space for large cats to play, rest, and stretch. They serve multiple purposes: providing climbing opportunities that mimic natural tree climbing, offering high vantage points that make cats feel secure, and giving expansive areas for lounging and stretching. 


### Size and Structure

Select a tower that matches your cat's size and activity level. For large cats, opt for towers that exceed 7 feet in height and are at least as wide as the cat's body. Choose design elements like multiple levels, platforms, and enclosed spaces to prevent overcrowding. The structure should be stable and able to support the cat's weight, with reinforced joints and supportive back legs. 


### Safe Construction Materials

High-quality materials like solid wood, metal, or composite materials with durable coatings are best for large cats. Avoid untreated wood and lightweight materials that may wobble under a heavy cat's weight. Consider indoor-outdoor cat furniture fabrics that resist scratches and tearing. The surface should provide good grip to prevent slips, with non-slip pads on stairs or step-downs. 


### Hidden Hazards and Safe Design

Avoid designs with small gaps that could trap claws or bodies. Steer clear of loose components that can come apart and potentially cause injury. Ensure there are no sharp edges or protruding screws. Built-in storage compartments are safer than hanging bags that can tangle or restrict movement. The base should have weight-distributing feet to prevent tipping. 


### Cat Appeal and Comfort Features

Incorporate features that large cats find stimulating, like vertical scratching posts, hidden climbing routes, and enclosed resting areas. Some cats prefer smooth surfaces for claw exercises, while others like textured materials for better grip. Consider features that mimic natural hunting elements, like perches with attached toys or visual barriers that create interest. The tower should allow the cat to move between levels safely and comfortably. 


## FAQ


### What size should a cat tower be for large cats?

A cat tower suitable for large cats should measure at least 4 feet in height and have a minimum base size of 24 inches by 24 inches. The tower should have wide, stable platforms that support the cat's weight comfortably. 

Consider a tower with a minimum of two levels, featuring gradual steps between each platform to prevent accidents. The structure should be made from durable materials like hardwood or sturdy board construction with no loose edges that could injure your cat. 


### How should I choose the right location for a cat tower?

Select a location away from noisy appliances and heavy furniture to avoid startling your cat. Place the tower near a window for natural sunlight and bird watching opportunities, but ensure the screen door is closed to prevent escapes. 

Choose a quiet room where your cat feels secure. The base of the tower should be on a stable surface with non-slip feet to prevent tipping. Ensure the area is accessible for your cat's daily routines without barriers. 


### What features should I look for in a sturdy cat tower?

A good cat tower has a solid core construction with no hollow center that could wobble under a large cat's weight. Look for reinforced joints and corners where the support beams meet the platforms. 

The material should resist wear from claws and show minimal signs of wear after regular use. Consider a tower with hidden storage for additional toys or a soft cushioned platform for extra comfort. 


### How can I modify an existing cat tower for a large cat?

Secure loose elements with pet-safe adhesives and reinforce any wobbly parts. Consider adding additional platforms or connecting two towers side-by-side to create more space. 

Check the stability of the structure each time your large cat uses it. If you notice any shifts or flexing under their weight, it's time to replace or upgrade the tower. 


### Can I build my own cat tower for a large cat?

Home-built cat towers require precise measurements and secure construction techniques. Use hardwood or marine-grade plywood with angled cuts for stairs and platform edges. 

While DIY projects can save money, consider professional-grade materials and designs specifically engineered for feline use. Pre-made towers often include built-in features like scratching posts and hiding spots. 


### What maintenance requirements are associated with cat towers?

Clean the tower weekly with pet-safe disinfectant and inspect for loose screws, splinters, or worn parts. Remove any sharp edges or loose pieces that could harm your cat. 

Check the base of the tower monthly for uneven wear that could indicate instability. Replace faded or damaged platforms, and consider a thorough inspection by a professional cat tower specialist every two years.
