### How do I measure for a Chivas jersey?

Measure your chest at its fullest point while wearing a T-shirt. For accuracy, take the measurement over your clothes, as jerseys typically run slightly small. 

If you're between sizes, size down for a more fitted look, especially for upper body measurements like chest and waist. Consider your intended use - players frequently wear smaller sizes for better movement and fit. 


### How are Chivas jerseys sized?

Chivas uses standard men's sizes ranging from small to 3XL, with specific size charts indicating the exact chest measurements. Women's sizes generally follow men's sizing, though some brands offer true women's cuts.

![Chivas-Jersey-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Chivas-Jersey-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What care instructions should I follow for Chivas jerseys?

Machine wash the jerseys in cold water using a gentle cycle and mild detergent to prevent color bleeding. Avoid mixing dark and light colors in the same wash load. 

Air dry the jerseys on a flat surface or lay them flat to dry. Avoid using a dryer as high temperatures can shrink the polyester material and damage printed graphics. 


### What's the difference between regular and match-worn Chivas jerseys?

Regular jerseys are produced in larger quantities and have fewer quality control checks compared to match-worn versions. They're suitable for casual wear but may show signs of wear after repeated washings.
