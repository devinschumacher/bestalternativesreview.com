## Buyer's Guide

Ice cube trays with lids are convenient kitchen gadgets that help you create and store ice cubes. These trays feature a simple design with individual compartments for water or other liquids, which freeze into solid cubes. Most models include a lid to protect the ice once it's frozen, keeping it crisp and clean until you're ready to use it. 


### Capacity and Size Options

Trays come in various sizes, typically ranging from 12 to 20 compartments per unit. Consider how much ice you need for household use or entertaining. If space is limited, smaller trays might be more practical. Look for trays with uniform compartment sizes for consistent ice cube formation. 


### MATERIAL OPTIONS

The most common materials are plastic and silicone. Plastic trays are lightweight and dishwasher-safe but may leach chemicals when exposed to very hot or cold temperatures. Silicone trays are more durable, flexible, and resistant to extreme temperatures, making them a popular choice for portable ice molds. 


### Freezing and Removal Features

Some trays include built-in channels that make it easy to release frozen cubes, while others require gentle twisting to pop them out. Consider trays with non-stick surfaces or textured sides that prevent cubes from sticking. The freezing process can take 4-6 hours, so choose a model that fits your needs for consistent ice production. 


### Storage and Portability

The lid serves a dual purpose of protecting the ice and allowing the tray to double as a portable container. Look for trays with tight-fitting lids that seal well to prevent moisture damage. Some models feature stackable designs that save counter space when not in use. Consider the overall size and weight of the unit when choosing a storage location. 


## FAQ


### What is an ice cube tray with lid?

Typically measuring about 7.5 inches by 2.5 inches, these kitchen essentials contain 12-24 flexible plastic cells that form ice cubes when filled with water and frozen. The lid snaps shut to prevent leakage and melting, keeping the ice cubes fresh until use. 

Select options feature adjustable depth settings for making crushed ice or larger cube shapes. Some models include measurement marks on the sides and are made from BPA-free or stainless steel materials. 


### How much water do I need to fill each cell?

Each standard ice cube cell requires approximately 4 ounces (1/2 cup) of water before freezing. This amount ensures the cube will fully expand and lock into shape during the freezing process. 

Use a measuring cup to fill each cell exactly, leaving no air bubbles trapped at the top. This method prevents misshapen cubes and maximizes the number of ice cubes you can produce from a single tray. 


### Can I customize the size of the ice cubes?

Many premium ice cube trays with lids offer adjustable depth settings, allowing you to choose between standard cubes, larger cubes, or crushed ice. Some models even feature multiple height options within the same tray for flexible cube sizes. 

The exact range of customization varies by model. Some trays offer 1-inch cubes for melting quickly, while others include settings for 1.5-inch cubes that stay frozen longer in drinks. 


### How long does it take to freeze the ice cubes?

Under standard conditions (32°F or below), most ice cube trays with lids will produce frozen cubes in approximately 4-6 hours. Leaving the tray in the freezer overnight typically results in completely frozen cubes ready for use. 

If you're in a hurry, place the filled tray in a bowl of ice water for the first hour before refrigerating it. This trick can help speed up the freezing process and reduce freezer burn. 


### What materials are used to make these trays?

The majority of ice cube trays with lids are made from BPA-free plastic, offering durability and easy cleaning. Some premium models feature stainless steel construction for excellent heat conductivity and lasting quality. 

A few models incorporate silicone or flexible materials for easier cube release. These alternatives resist cracks and wear better than traditional plastic in frequent use. 


### How do I remove the frozen ice cubes?

Most standard ice cube trays with lids feature flexible plastic walls that allow the cubes to pop out easily. Gently flex the sides of the cell, and the ice should release cleanly without damage. 

If you encounter difficulty, run the filled tray under warm water for 5-10 seconds to slightly loosen the grip. Avoid using knives or forks, as they can scratch or damage the tray's surface.
