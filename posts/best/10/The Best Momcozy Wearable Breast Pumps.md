### What is a wearable breast pump?

A wearable breast pump is a pump system that integrates a small, discreet pump with a comfortable bra-style carrier. Unlike traditional pumps that use a separate unit and tubing, wearable pumps allow hands-free pumping while maintaining effective milk removal. 

These pumps are ideal for busy moms who need to pump in various settings, from workplace meetings to social events. The compact design makes them less noticeable than conventional pumps while still delivering reliable performance. 


### How does the Momcozy wearable pump work?

The pump consists of a motor unit that attaches to the bra carrier via a small tube. When activated, the motor draws milk through the tube and collection container discreetly hidden in the bra. The pumping cycle is controlled by a handheld or app interface, allowing settings to be adjusted as needed. 

The motor unit features quiet operation to prevent disturbance during use, and most models include a choice of flow settings to match the user's specific pumping needs. Power can come from batteries or a charging cable, depending on the model.

### What are the key benefits of the Momcozy design?

The Momcozy's integrated design minimizes pumping downtime, as the unit can be worn under clothing throughout the day. This convenience helps establish and maintain milk supply, crucial for successful breastfeeding. 

The pump's quiet operation and comfortable bra design reduce pumping anxiety, while the ability to adjust flow and settings allows for optimal milk removal. The portable nature of the pump makes it suitable for travel and various daily activities. 


### How long does it take to express a full feeding with this pump?

Most users take between 15-20 minutes to complete a full feeding session, though this can vary based on individual factors like milk production and pump settings. The pump's quiet operation allows pumping to be done discreetly. 

Users should expect to pump 2-3 times per day in addition to direct breastfeeding to maintain adequate milk supply. The pump's efficiency helps ensure that full feedings are achieved within this timeframe.

### Can the Momcozy pump handle different lactation stages?

The pump is suitable for all lactation stages, from initial lactation to weaning. Its adjustable flow settings help accommodate changes in milk consistency and volume throughout the breastfeeding journey. 

Users with established milk supply may find the pump efficient enough for daily needs, while those with low supply might need to combine pumping with frequent direct breastfeeding sessions. 


### What maintenance is required for the Momcozy pump?

Regular maintenance includes cleaning the pump components and bra carrier daily using mild soap and water. The motor unit and collection container should be air-dried thoroughly before each use to prevent mold or bacteria growth. 

Every 3-6 months, users should replace the pump's tubing and any worn parts to maintain optimal performance and hygiene. The pump's motor unit and batteries should be checked monthly to ensure reliable operation during use.
