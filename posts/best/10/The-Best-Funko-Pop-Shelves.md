![Funko-Pop-Shelves-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Funko-Pop-Shelves-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is the difference between a standard Funko Pop shelf and a display case?

Standard shelves provide open display space for your Funko Pop collection, typically measuring around 24 inches in length and featuring adjustable shelves. Display cases offer more protection with glass-fronted enclosures, often measuring 18 inches in length, and can include lighting options for enhanced visibility. 

Standard shelves are ideal for casual display and easy visibility, while cases provide superior protection against dust and accidental damage, making them suitable for larger collections or display spaces with frequent traffic. 


### How do I determine the right shelf size for my collection?

Measure the combined width of your largest collection pieces to determine the minimum shelf length needed. Consider extra space for future additions, typically 1-2 inches per figure. 

Calculate the total height of your collection and compare it to the shelf's height and depth specifications to ensure all figures fit comfortably without stacking.

Standard shelves are usually constructed fromMDF (Medium-Density Fiberboard) with a painted surface. These are lightweight and economical options for most collections. 

Higher-end models may feature solid wood construction with premium finishes, offering superior durability and aesthetic appeal for long-term display. 


### Are the shelves compatible with other display systems?

Most standard shelves are designed to work with common display brackets and supports, allowing flexibility in mounting options. 

Display cases often include proprietary mounting systems, so ensure compatibility with your existing wall or display structure before purchasing.

### How much weight can the shelves support?

Standard shelves typically support between 50-75 pounds per square foot, depending on the model and construction material. 

Display cases usually have weight capacities ranging from 10-20 pounds per shelf, though premium models may exceed this range. 


### What maintenance is required for the shelves?

Standard shelves need regular dusting and minor touch-ups to maintain their painted surface. Regularly check for loose screws and ensure all mounting hardware remains secure. 

Display cases require occasional cleaning of both the glass surfaces and interior shelves. Pay special attention to maintaining the seal around the glass to prevent moisture damage.
