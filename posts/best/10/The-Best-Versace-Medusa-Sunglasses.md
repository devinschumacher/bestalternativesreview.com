## Buyer's Guide

Versace Medusa sunglasses combine iconic brand elements with stylish designs. The Medusa head, a symbol of protection and power, adorns these frames, while premium materials and attention to detail define their quality. 


### Frame Materials

Versace typically uses high-quality materials like metal, acetate, and engineered frames. Consider your preferred material, with metal offering durability and acetate providing lighter options. Engineered frames balance style with practicality. 


### Lens Options

Polarized lenses reduce glare and enhance clarity, ideal for outdoor activities. Fotourban lenses offer UV protection with a modern color palette. Choose based on your needs and the specific lens technology you prefer. 


### Size and Fit

Versace offers multiple sizes to ensure a proper fit. Consider your face shape and desired frame size when selecting. The temples and bridge should comfortably hug your ears and nose, without causing pressure.
