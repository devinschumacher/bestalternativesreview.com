## Buyer's Guide

Cable cutters are specialized tools designed for safely and efficiently cutting through various types of cables and wires. These tools come with specific features that enhance their functionality and durability. Understanding these features will help you select the right cable cutter for your needs. 


### Cutting Mechanism

Cable cutters typically use either a spring-loaded blade or a manual pliers-like design. Spring-loaded models provide quick, single-handed operation, ideal for cutting multiple cables. Manual pliers-style cutters offer more torque and are suitable for cutting thicker cables or those embedded in concrete. The cutting edge should be hardened steel with a precision-ground angle for clean cuts. 

![Cable-Cutters-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cable-Cutters-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Handle Design

The handle design significantly affects user comfort and control. Look for an insulated, non-slip handle that provides a secure grip without excessive material. The handle length should be ergonomically optimized for comfortable use during extended cutting sessions. Additionally, some cutters feature insulated handles for working with electrical cables. 


### Cable Size Capacity

Each cable cutter has a maximum cable diameter it can handle. This capacity varies based on the tool's design and blade dimensions. For residential use, models capable of cutting up to 1/2 inch (13 mm) are common. Professional-grade cutters often exceed this capacity, with some capable of handling larger industrial cables.

### Additional Features

Some cable cutters include precision scales for measuring cable diameter, which helps in selecting the appropriate cutting position. Others feature built-in wire strippers for quick cable preparation. Some models include cutting guides or templates for making straight cuts in duct work or conduit. Consider these features based on your specific application requirements. 


## FAQ

![Cable-Cutters-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cable-Cutters-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a cable cutter, and how is it different from regular scissors?

A cable cutter is a specialized tool designed for cutting through various types of cables, including electrical, telephone, and coaxial cables. Unlike regular scissors, cable cutters are built for durability and feature sharp, sturdy blades that can handle the tough insulation and cores found in cables. 

Key differences between cable cutters and scissors include resistance to corrosion (due to stainless steel construction), precise cutting capabilities (with some models featuring blade angles between 60-90 degrees), and the ability to cut through both solid and stranded cable cores. 


### What types of cables can be cut with a regular cable cutter?

Routine cable cutters are suitable for most standard cables, including telephone wires, computer cables, and small-diameter coaxial cables. The blade width and cutting angle determine the maximum cable diameter they can handle effectively. 

For larger cables or specific applications (like heavy-duty power cables), specialized cutters may be required. Always check the tool's specifications to ensure it matches the cable size and type you're working with. 

![Cable-Cutters-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cable-Cutters-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do cable cutters prevent electrical shock?

Most cable cutters feature insulated handles made from materials like rubber or PVC, which are rated for electrical safety. Some models also include blade guards that help prevent contact between the blade edges and exposed conductors during cutting. 

It's crucial to use the correct cutting technique and maintain the tool in good condition. Regular inspection of the blade insulators and grounding straps (if present) helps ensure the tool remains safe for electrical cable cutting. 


### What maintenance do cable cutters require?

Regular cleaning and inspection are essential for maintaining the functionality and safety of cable cutters. After each use, wipe down the tool with a clean cloth and store it in a dry place to prevent corrosion. 

Check the blade edges for sharpness and the handle insulation for integrity regularly. Dull blades should be sharpened professionally, while damaged insulators need to be replaced immediately. 

![Cable-Cutters-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cable-Cutters-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can I use any scissors to cut cables?

While some scissors may appear similar to cable cutters, they're not designed for the specific requirements of cable cutting. Regular scissors lack the blade durability, corrosion resistance, and cutting angles suitable for cable cores. 

Using incorrect tools can damage both the cable and the cutting instrument, potentially leading to hazardous situations. Stick to specialized cable cutters to ensure clean, safe cuts and proper tool longevity. 


### What should I consider when buying a cable cutter?

Key considerations include blade type (shear-style for precise cuts, drop-style for impact resistance), handle material and grip design for comfort and safety, and voltage rating to match your work requirements. 

Additional features may include blade angle optimization for different cable types, ergonomics for extended use, and length options for various workspace requirements. Always choose a tool that matches your specific cutting needs and working conditions.
