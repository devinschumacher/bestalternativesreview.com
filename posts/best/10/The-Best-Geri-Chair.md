## Buyer's Guide

A geriatric chair, designed for older adults and individuals with mobility challenges, combines comfort and safety features to enhance daily living. These chairs offer specialized support and adjustable settings to prevent pressure sores and promote good posture. 


### Key Features to Consider

The most important aspects of a geriatric chair include adjustable height, seat and backrest angles, and wide, padded armrests. Look for chairs with a minimum seat depth of 18 inches and seat width of 19-20 inches to accommodate larger frames comfortably. 

Pressure-relieving features like foam inserts, gel seating, or alternate sitting surfaces help prevent bedsores and improve circulation. The chair should have adequate lumbar support and the ability totilt back at least 120 degrees to relieve pressure on the spine. 

![Geri-Chair-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Geri-Chair-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Safety and Stability

Sturdy, four-legged bases with non-slip feet prevent tipping and provide stability. Five-star bases with rockers offer better balance and easier transfers. The chair should have five-point or five-star base construction with solid wood or metal legs for durability. 

Armrests should be at least 20 inches long, adjustable in height, and feature rail extensions for stability. The seat needs side guards or safety bars that can be raised or lowered to prevent the user from sliding out. 


### Additional Considerations

Storage options like built-in baskets or shelves can keep commonly used items within reach. Some chairs feature wheels or casters for easy movement between rooms. Quick-release mechanisms simplify transfers from bed or wheelchair. 

Reclinable mechanisms with adjustable straps prevent the seat from folding unintentionally. The chair's weight capacity should match the user's weight, typically ranging from 225-300 lbs. 

![Geri-Chair-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Geri-Chair-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Maintenance and Cleaning

Water-resistant upholstery materials resist stains and moisture. Detachable seat and backrest covers simplify cleaning. The chair should have smooth, non-abrasive finishes to prevent scratches during movement. 

Regular maintenance includes checking for loose parts, ensuring all mechanisms operate correctly, and replacing worn-out components promptly. Periodic inspection for wear and tear extends the chair's lifespan and ensures continued safety.

### Who should use a Geri chair?

They are also suitable for individuals recovering from surgeries, stroke patients, and those with chronic conditions affecting their ability to sit and stand safely. 

The chairs provide significant support for caregivers by reducing physical strain during transfer assistance and improving the independence of the user, allowing for more confident movement throughout the home.

![Geri-Chair-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Geri-Chair-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How should a Geri chair be positioned in the home?

Position the chair in a spacious room with enough clearance for the user to stand up safely. Place it near frequently used areas like the bathroom, kitchen, or living room to facilitate movement. Ensure there is at least 3 feet of space around the chair for transfers and wheelchair access if needed. 

Position the seat at a height suitable for standing transfers, typically between 22-24 inches. The chair should sit on level, stable flooring with non-slip feet to prevent tipping. Consider the room's layout and potential obstacles when choosing a location. 


### What is the typical lifespan of a Geri chair?

The lifespan of a Geri chair depends on its quality, usage frequency, and maintenance. Well-made chairs with durable materials and robust construction can last 5-10 years with regular use. Factors affecting longevity include seat cushion replacement needs, frame degradation, and wear on moving parts. 

To extend the chair's life, follow the manufacturer's care instructions for cleaning and maintenance. Replace worn seat cushions and check for structural integrity annually. Proper use and prompt attention to maintenance issues can significantly increase the chair's usable lifespan.
