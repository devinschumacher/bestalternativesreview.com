### How does the Rapsodo Mobile Launch Monitor compare to standalone launch monitors?

The Rapsodo Mobile Launch Monitor combines premium ball flight tracking with portable convenience, offering similar accuracy to dedicated standalone monitors. It tracks all critical golf swing parameters and provides detailed analysis through its app. 

While standalone monitors may offer more comprehensive features and data depth, the Rapsodo mobile version delivers precise measurements in a more flexible, on-the-go format that can be used anywhere golfing is played. 


### What are the limitations of the Rapsodo Mobile Launch Monitor?

The monitor has limitations in extremely high winds or during heavy rain. While it performs well in most weather conditions, wind speeds exceeding 20 mph can affect measurement accuracy. The app may also struggle with satellite signal quality in dense tree canopies or urban environments. 

Like all tracking devices, the Rapsodo has a maximum range for reliable measurements. Beyond 30 feet from the monitor, accuracy decreases, and the app's data interpretation becomes less precise. It's best used within its optimal measurement range for the most accurate results.
