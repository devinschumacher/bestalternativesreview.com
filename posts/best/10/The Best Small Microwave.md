Small microwave ovens offer convenient reheating and quick cooking solutions for smaller food portions. These compact appliances are ideal for dorm rooms, apartments, or student housing where space is limited. Understanding the key features and specifications is crucial to selecting a microwave that meets your needs while providing reliable performance. 


### Capacity

Capacity determines how much food the microwave can hold at once. Common sizes range from 0.7 to 1.2 cubic feet, with 1.0 cubic feet providing ample space for most single-person meals or quick reheating of smaller dishes. If you frequently cook full meals or have dietary requirements, consider a slightly larger capacity. 

![Small-Microwave-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Small-Microwave-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Power and Cooking Performance

The microwave's power level affects cooking speed and efficiency. Most small microwaves operate between 600 and 1200 watts. Higher wattage generally results in faster cooking times and better performance with larger or more complex foods. Consider the microwave's cooking capabilities based on your primary usage - basic defrosting and reheating typically require lower wattage, while larger meals or defrosting needs may benefit from higher wattage. 


### Additional Features

Common features include turntables for even heating, child locks for safety, and digital displays with preset cooking programs. Built-in convection elements allow baking and roasting in addition to microwave functions. For frequent use or specific dietary needs, look for models with adjustable power settings and precise temperature control options. 

![Small-Microwave-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Small-Microwave-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Size and Design

Width typically ranges from 15 to 20 inches, with a height between 12 and 15 inches and depth of 15 to 18 inches. Consider the available counter space and how the microwave will fit within your kitchen or storage area. Stainless steel or modern white finishes are popular choices for matching existing kitchen dÃ©cor, while some models offer unique shapes or features like hidden doors for a more compact appearance. 


## FAQ

![Small-Microwave-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Small-Microwave-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What features should I consider when selecting a small microwave?

Small microwaves vary significantly in features, so it's important to match your needs. Common options include power levels for faster cooking, turntables for even heating, and child-lock safety features for family use. Digital displays and preset cooking functions can also enhance convenience. 

The capacity and dimensions are crucial measurements. Ensure the microwave can fit your largest cookware and your kitchen's available counter space while still allowing easy access for loading and unloading. 


### How do wattage and cooking time relate in small microwave selection?

Microwave wattage determines cooking speed and effectiveness. Higher wattage usually means faster cooking and better performance, especially for larger or denser foods. However, cooking time depends on factors like food quantity and type, not just wattage alone. 

Most microwave recipes recommend power levels and cooking times based on standard wattage. For example, a 1000-watt microwave might cook food in 50% of the time recommended for a 1200-watt microwave, while maintaining similar results. 

![Small-Microwave-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Small-Microwave-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What maintenance requirements are typical for small microwaves?

Regular maintenance for a small microwave includes cleaning the interior and exterior monthly, checking door seals for proper closure, and ensuring vents and exhaust filters are clear. The turntable and rotating plate should be lubricated every six months for smooth operation. 

Deep cleaning requires unplugging the microwave. Use mild soap and water for the interior and a damp cloth for the exterior. For stubborn stains, vinegar and water solutions work well, but avoid harsh chemicals and abrasive cleaners that can damage the microwave's surfaces. 


### Can small microwaves safely heat all types of food and containers?

Small microwaves can heat most food and containers safely, but always check packaging instructions or manufacturer guidelines. Glass, ceramic, and some plastic containers with microwave-safe labels are suitable. Metal, foil, and some plastics can cause sparks and damage the microwave. 

Food safety requires covering dishes to prevent splattering and using appropriate cookware that maintains food quality. For uneven heating concerns, use a microwave-safe plate or turn the food partway through cooking. 

![Small-Microwave-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Small-Microwave-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What size replacements parts are commonly needed for small microwaves?

The most frequently replaced parts in small microwaves include the turntable motor, door seals, and heating elements. Replacement costs vary based on the part and brand. Turntable motors usually cost between $10-20, door seals range from $20-50, and heating elements cost $30-70. 

When replacing parts, ensure exact compatibility with your model. Matching part numbers and noting specific model requirements helps in finding genuine replacements that fit your microwave's specifications. 


### How do small microwave prices typically vary between brands and models?

Small microwave prices usually range from $30-300, with differences primarily based on features and capacity. Basic models without advanced functions typically cost $30-100, while larger capacities and additional features like convection cooking or built-in Wi-Fi can raise prices to $200-300. 

Entry-level microwaves emphasize functionality and basic operations, while premium models focus on convenience features, cooking performance, and often incorporate smart technology for increased functionality.
