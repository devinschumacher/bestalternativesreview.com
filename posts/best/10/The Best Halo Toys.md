### Essential Features of Halo Toys

Halo toys typically include premium construction materials for durability, finely detailed representations of characters and vehicles, and LED lighting effects in key areas. The best toys feature accurate scaling and poseability for collectors, while action figures often include multiple weapons and accessories. Vehicles commonly come with realistic movement features and rotating turrets. 


### Scale and Compatibility

When choosing Halo toys, consider the scale of the figures and vehicles to ensure proper display and collection opportunities.
