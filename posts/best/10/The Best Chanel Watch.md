### Movement and Functionality

Chanel offers both mechanical and quartz movements, each providing distinct benefits.

Verified authentication is crucial when purchasing a Chanel watch. Look for official guarantees, serial numbers, and brand-specific hallmarks. Proper care extends the life of your watch and maintains its value. This includes regular professional cleaning, avoiding exposure to chemicals, and storing your watch in a protective case when not in use.
