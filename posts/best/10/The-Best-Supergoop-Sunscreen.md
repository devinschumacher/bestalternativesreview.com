## Buyer's Guide

Sunscreen is a crucial component of any skincare routine, particularly for protecting against UV damage and preventing skin cancer. When selecting a sunscreen, several key factors determine its effectiveness and suitability for your skin type and lifestyle needs. 


### SPF and Broad-Spectrum Protection

The SPF (Sun Protection Factor) rating indicates how well a sunscreen blocks UVB rays, which cause sunburn. Look for at least SPF 30, which protects against 97% of UVB rays. Broad-spectrum sunscreens protect against both UVB and UVA rays, which penetrate deeper into skin and contribute to aging and skin damage. 

![Supergoop-Sunscreen-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Supergoop-Sunscreen-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Skin Type Compatibility

Different sunscreens work best for various skin types. Oil-free options are suitable for combination and oily skin, while those with added moisturizers are better for dry skin. Those with sensitive skin should choose hypoallergenic, fragrance-free products to prevent irritation. 


### Water Resistance and Application

Water-resistant sunscreens stay effective even when sweating or swimming, maintaining their protection for 40-80 minutes. Apply sunscreen liberally every 2 hours or after swimming or sweating to ensure continuous protection. For maximum effectiveness, apply sunscreen 15-30 minutes before sun exposure and use enough – about one ounce (a shot glass worth) for the entire body. 

![Supergoop-Sunscreen-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Supergoop-Sunscreen-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Physical vs. Chemical Sunscreens

Physical sunscreens contain zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, which create a protective barrier on the skin's surface. They typically provide immediate protection and are suitable for sensitive skin. Chemical sunscreens absorb UV rays and convert them to heat, offering broader protection but may take 20 minutes to become effective. Consider your skin type and activity level when choosing between these formulations. 


## FAQ

![Supergoop-Sunscreen-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Supergoop-Sunscreen-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What makes Supergoop sunscreens different from other brands?

Supergoop sunscreens stand out due to their powerful broad-spectrum protection, combining high SPF ratings with advanced ingredients like Mexoryl SX and XL. Their formulations are designed for daily use and are particularly suitable for active lifestyles and sensitive skin types. 

The company's commitment to environmental sustainability and social responsibility further distinguishes their products, offering both practical and ethical benefits to consumers. 


### How do I choose the right Supergoop sunscreen for my skin type?

For oily or combination skin, consider lightweight formulas like Supergoop! Unseen Sunscreen or Super Light Defense Facial Sunscreen. Dry or mature skin may prefer the richer hydration of formulas like the Super Setting Face Serum SPF 40 or Super Water-In-Oil Mineral Sunscreen SPF 40. 

If you have sensitive skin, look for products labeled "hypoallergenic" such as the Super Setting Face Serum SPF 40 or the Super Melt-In Sunscreen Stick SPF 40, which contain fewer irritants and are less likely to cause reactions. 

![Supergoop-Sunscreen-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Supergoop-Sunscreen-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How should I apply Supergoop sunscreen for maximum protection?

To ensure even coverage, apply Supergoop sunscreen liberally to all exposed skin 15 minutes before sun exposure. Use 1 ounce (approximately a shot glass full) to cover your entire body. Reapply every two hours or after swimming or sweating. 

For the face, use a liberal amount and spread evenly, paying special attention to areas prone to sun damage such as the nose, cheeks, and ears. Consider using both a face sunscreen and a body sunscreen for complete protection. 


### Are Supergoop sunscreens water resistant?

Most Supergoop sunscreens are water resistant for 40-80 minutes, depending on the specific product. The Super Water-In-Oil Mineral Sunscreen SPF 40 is certified water-resistant for 80 minutes, while others like the Unseen Sunscreen and Body Shield SPF 50 are water resistant for 40 minutes. 

Check the product label for water resistance claims. Always reapply sunscreen immediately after swimming or sweating heavily to maintain protection levels. 

![Supergoop-Sunscreen-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Supergoop-Sunscreen-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How long does Supergoop sunscreen last once the bottle is opened?

Supergoop sunscreens maintain their effectiveness when properly stored in a cool, dry place, but their shelf life decreases once the bottle is opened. The company recommends using products within 6 months of opening for optimal performance and safety. 

After opening, store sunscreen in a cool place away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures. Keeping it in the vehicle during hot weather can degrade the product's effectiveness over time. 


### Are Supergoop sunscreens suitable for children?

Supergoop offers several child-friendly sunscreens suitable for ages 6 months and older. The Super Melt-In Sunscreen Stick SPF 40 and the Body Shield SPF 50 are both child-friendly options with pleasant, unscented formulas that are less likely to irritate young skin. 

For children under 6 months, seek shade and use protective clothing to reduce sun exposure, as the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends avoiding sunscreen on infants in this age group.
