## Buyer's Guide

The Irocker Sup category combines versatility with performance, offering riders a dynamic blend of capabilities. Understanding key features will help you select a model that matches your riding style and objectives. 


### Performance Metrics

Power-to-weight ratio, horsepower, and torque specifications differentiate performance levels. High-end models typically offer more robust acceleration and top-end speed, while lighter frames can provide exceptional maneuverability. 


###  Frame and Suspension

Materials like carbon fiber, aluminum, and steel influence durability and ride characteristics. Carbon fiber offers the best weight-to-strength ratio but can be more expensive. Consider your intended use: harsh terrain requires tougher materials, while road or track conditions allow for lighter construction. 


### Wheel and Tire Options

Wheel size and tire specifications affect handling, stability, and ride comfort. Larger wheels improve cornering grip but reduce acceleration. Tire profile and compound determine whether you prioritize road grip, all-terrain capability, or off-road traction. 


### Ergonomics and Control Layout

Riser height, handlebar position, and control placement impact rider comfort and control. Higher risers offer better ground clearance but less direct input feel. Proper ergonomics should allow relaxed riding posture while maintaining easy access to all controls.
