## Buyer's Guide

Oakley shirts combine performance fabrics with distinctive designs, making them a popular choice for active wear enthusiasts. This buying guide helps you understand the key features and considerations when selecting Oakley shirts. 


### Performance Fabrics

Oakley shirts use specialized materials like moisture-wicking Dri-FIT fabric to keep you dry and comfortable during workouts. Their moisture management properties help prevent sweat buildup, keeping you dry from the gym to long runs. The company also incorporates stretchy Four-Way Stretch material in many designs for unrestricted movement. 


### Style Options

Their shirt collection ranges from classic T-shirts and crewnecks to more technical styles like base layers and cycling shirts. Oakley frequently updates its designs with new patterns and colorways, though their iconic triangle logo remains prominent. Crewneck shirts offer basic style, while v-necks provide a more contemporary look. 


### Fit Considerations

Oakley shirts typically run true to size, but their technical fabrics offer some stretching. The brand recommends measuring your chest and comparing it to their size chart for accurate fits. Baseball-style crewnecks have a boxier silhouette, while regular crewnecks fit closer to the body. They offer both long-sleeve and sleeveless options across their styles. 


### Protection Features

Many Oakley shirts incorporate UV protection with UPF ratings to shield your skin from the sun's rays. Their longer-sleeve options often feature thumbholes to prevent fabric from riding up during activities. Some advanced designs incorporate ventilation panels and mesh areas for enhanced breathability during intense workouts. 


## FAQ


### What materials are used in Oakley shirts?

Oakley shirts typically feature a blend of polyester and spandex for moisture-wicking and stretchy comfort. Some premium models incorporate breathable fabric technologies like Omni-vent to enhance airflow and keep you cool during physical activity. 

The shirt construction usually includes reinforced stitching at stress points and a modern athletic cut for freedom of movement. Consider the specific model you're interested in to understand the exact material composition. 


### How do Oakley shirts compare in durability across their range?

Basic Oakley shirts offer good durability with 200+ washes before showing signs of wear. Higher-end models made from premium materials like nylon or polyester with built-in UV protection typically maintain their quality longer, lasting 300+ washes with minimal fading. 

Regular care practices like turning the shirt inside out before washing help extend the life of all Oakley shirts. The most durable options are often the more expensive models with reinforced stitching and premium materials. 


### Which Oakley shirts provide the best sun protection?

Oakley offers several shirt styles with UPF 50+ sun protection, including the Streamliner LT and OnDeck 2. These specialized shirts block 99-100% of UV radiation, suitable for extended outdoor activities like running or cycling. 

While most regular Oakley shirts have UPF 30+ protection, the dedicated sun protection models offer superior UV blocking with a slightly thicker, more textured fabric for added sun barrier. 


### What sizes should I consider when ordering Oakley shirts?

Oakley tends to run slightly smaller than average, particularly in the chest measurement. Most styles list a true-to-size fit for medium, with small being tight and large offering generous room. Consider your preferred level of compression and intended layering when selecting a size. 

The Streamliner LT and OnDeck 2 have a more relaxed fit, while the Raze and Streamline have a more athletic compression feel. Measuring your chest and comparing it to the size chart before ordering helps find the perfect fit. 


### Can Oakley shirts be machine washed?

Yes, all Oakley shirts can be machine washed using a mild detergent. Turn the shirt inside out before washing to protect graphics and extend fabric life. Use cold water and avoid fabric softeners, which can reduce the moisture-wicking properties of the fabric. 

Air drying is recommended to maintain the shape and integrity of the shirt. If using a dryer, select a low heat setting and remove the shirt while it's still slightly damp to prevent stretching. 


### What are the main sizing differences between men's and women's Oakley shirts?

Men's Oakley shirts tend to have a slightly more athletic fit with a wider shoulder and chest measurement. Women's styles often feature a more flattering feminine cut with a closer fit through the torso and arms. The difference ranges from 1-2 inches across the chest and shoulders. 

Women should consider sizing up if they prefer a roomier fit, while men might need to size down in women's styles that offer a closer athletic cut. The best approach is to compare measurements between men's and women's styles to find your ideal fit.
