These black vegan leather knee-high boots are a standout addition to any wardrobe, combining a commanding 3-inch platform with bold tiered chains and o-ring details.

These knee-high boots combine a striking 5.5-inch heel with Demonia's signature vampire teeth and cat moon charm details. The black vegan leather boots feature an adjustable lace-up front and hidden zip closure, while the clip-on back chain adds an edgy touch. The platform height provides a confidence boost without sacrificing too much mobility, though some users note the chains can be delicate and may break easily.

Demonic elegance comes with a 14-centimeter heel in these black platform boots, though some users report the height takes some getting used to. The synthetic and textile construction holds up well despite minor wear on the platform edges after a few days of wear. With dual zippered closures and adjustable straps, they offer both security and style, though customers with larger calves may need to size up to achieve the perfect fit.

These platform boots combine height with flexibility, thanks to the stretch panel and well-placed laces that let you customize the fit around your calves and thighs. The side zip makes them easy to get on and off, while the PU leather upper keeps them looking sharp even after lots of wear. The 4.5-inch height and generous 5-star rating show these boots can handle all-day wear without compromising on comfort.

These black platform boots combine striking aesthetics with practical design elements like metal buckles and a hidden zip closure. Standing 5.5 inches tall, they're tall enough to make a statement but not so high that they're difficult to walk in—especially when you consider the 8 adjustable straps that help keep them firmly in place. While some users have noted minor issues with the vegan leather material scuffing easily and the straps not being perfectly adjustable for all calf sizes, the overall consensus is that these boots are worth their price tag for the quality construction and flattering height.

## Buyer's Guide

Demonia platform boots combine height, comfort, and style - but not all options are created equal. Understanding the key features will help you find the perfect pair for your needs. 


### Height Options

Most Demonia platform boots range from 3 to 6 inches, with variations in heel type (block, spike, stiletto). Consider your comfort level and intended use (everyday wear vs. special occasions). 


### Construction Quality

The boot's core is typically made from synthetic leather or suede. Check for durable soles (usually rubber or PVC), reinforced heel caps, and quality stitching. Premium models often feature leather linings and insoles with arch support. 


### Fit and Width Options

Most styles come in multiple widths, from narrow to extra-wide. Allow for about a half-size larger than your regular shoe, as Demonia boots typically run slightly big. The insole should feel roomy but not loose. 


### Care Requirements

Demonia recommends cleaning platform boots with a damp cloth and air-drying. The boots should be reconditioned regularly with polish and protector spray. Storage should be in a cool, dry place without direct sunlight. 


## FAQ


### Are Demonia platform boots comfortable to wear?

Many customers find Demonia platform boots comfortable, though comfort can vary based on individual foot shape and arch support needs. The thick soles provide cushioning, but some users may need to break them in before regular wear. 

The boots typically run true to size, but sizing can vary slightly between styles. It's recommended to measure your feet and consult the specific size guide for your chosen style. 


### What materials are Demonia platform boots made from?

The boots are constructed from a combination of synthetic leather and man-made materials, designed to balance durability and style. The outsoles feature a rubber compound for grip and longevity. 

The synthetic leather upper provides water resistance and easy cleaning, while the inner lining is typically made from a breathable fabric blend. 


### How high are Demonia platform boots?

The height varies by style, with most boots measuring between 3 to 4 inches. The platform measurement is typically indicated in the product description. 

Some styles offer adjustable height options, allowing you to customize the overall stack height to your preference. 


### What styles are available in Demonia platform boots?

The collection includes various styles, ranging from casual to dressy options. Common styles include ankle boots, mid-calf boots, and thigh-high boots, each with their own heel height and decorative elements. 

Popular embellishments include glitter finishes, metallic accents, and decorative straps. The collection also offers both zippered and lace-up closure options. 


### Are Demonia platform boots suitable for daily wear?

While Demonia platform boots can be dressed up or down, they may not be the most practical choice for all-day wear due to their height and potential weight. They work well for shorter outings or special occasions. 

Wearers report that while initially challenging, the boots become more manageable after breaking them in. Proper footwear rotation is recommended to prevent foot fatigue. 


### How should I care for Demonia platform boots?

The boots should be wiped down regularly with a damp cloth to remove dust and dirt. For deeper cleaning, you can use mild soap and water, ensuring the boots are completely dry before wearing. 

Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasives, which can damage the synthetic leather finish. Store the boots in a cool, dry place when not in use to maintain their shape and condition.
