## Buyer's Guide

When selecting a 20x24 frame, several key factors influence its quality and functionality. Understanding these aspects helps you choose a frame that complements your artwork while providing lasting protection. 


### Frame Materials

The frame's material, such as wood, metal, or plastic, affects its durability, appearance, and weight. Common materials like cedar and oak wood offer classic styling, while aluminum provides strength with minimal weight. Consider the frame's visibility in your space and how it will weather environmental conditions.

### Finishes and Finishes

Frame finishes range from natural wood grains to painted surfaces and decorative treatments. The finish should coordinate with your room's decor while protecting the artwork from UV damage. Premium finishes often include protective coatings that enhance longevity and appearance. 


### Back Supports and Protective Features

Recessed back edges prevent damage from accidental bumps, while wire support systems protect against crushing forces. Some frames include UV protection, air filtration, or humidity control, which are essential for sensitive artwork, especially in varying environmental conditions.

### Mounting and Hanging Options

Securing methods, such as hanging brackets or hanging wires, should match the frame's weight capacity. Adjustable mounting options allow precise artwork placement and wall leveling. The frame's weight rating must exceed the artwork's total weight to prevent sagging or detachment. 


## FAQ

![20x24-Frame-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/20x24-Frame-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What size is a 20x24 frame?

A 20x24 frame measures 20 inches in width and 24 inches in height, including the frame. The framed piece itself (excluding the frame) measures 16x20 inches. 

This standard frame size is ideal for displaying medium-sized prints, photographs, and artwork. It's a popular choice for both residential and commercial applications. 


### What materials are commonly used in 20x24 frames?

Common frame materials include wood, metal, and plastic. Wood frames often feature oak, cherry, or maple finishes, while metal frames are available in aluminum and brass. 

The frame's backing materials typically include mat board, foam core, or rigid plastic. Quality frames use acid-free materials to protect artwork and prevent fading. 

![20x24-Frame-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/20x24-Frame-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do I measure my artwork for a 20x24 frame?

### What are the weight limits for 20x24 frames?
