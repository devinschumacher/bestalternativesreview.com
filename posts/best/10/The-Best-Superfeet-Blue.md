### How do I determine my Superfeet Blue size?

If you find your feet vary in size, choose the larger measurement to ensure proper fit and support. 


### Can Superfeet Blue insoles be cut to size?

Superfeet Blue insoles can be trimmed with scissors if needed to fit specific footwear. It's recommended to remove a small amount of material at a time to maintain proper arch support and cushioning.
