These Madewell slides are a comfy addition to any summer wardrobe, with a lightweight feel and nice cushioning from the padded leather insole. The slightly elevated 0.75-inch platform gives you a little extra height while keeping the silhouette sleek and understated.

These slide sandals blend a lightweight design with woven leather straps that give them a delicate touch. The cow leather footbed and pig leather lining offer good cushioning, though some may need to break them in initially. The leather outsole provides decent grip while keeping the sandals relatively light for summer wear.

These lightweight sandals combine fashion with functionality, featuring a soft neoprene construction that molds to your foot while keeping it cool and comfortable. The dual Velcro straps offer just the right amount of adjustability, though they can feel a bit loose unless you tighten them properly. They're great for everyday wear or casual outings, thanks to their versatile design and surprisingly supportive construction. 


### [Madewell The Mabel Sandal](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Madewell+Sandals?utm\_term=madewell-the-mabel-sandal)

![Madewell The Mabel Sandal | Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcTRAVg7AStmj6PfcSOqR-lztnlnHS7rejGxq-M8q\_-1t1wl7ikC4lKC5DrDN3vUox574T5bNSH4YVbhMkP9gGIEVTCvSRgg&usqp=CAY)

These ankle-strap leather sandals from Madewell blend refined detailing with practical comfort. Made from smooth apple butter leather with gold-toned hardware, the adjustable strap and padded insole provide a custom fit without sacrificing ease. While the color brown adds a sophisticated depth, the shoe runs quite narrow, particularly across the toes, so consider sizing up for a more relaxed wear. 


### [Madewell The Amel Slide Sandal](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Madewell+Sandals?utm\_term=madewell-the-amel-slide-sandal)

![Madewell The Amel Slide Sandal | Image](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcQl73N356sRwJ3ZmlhYfcmcF4uSVgPf\_6-tIXVw\_Q0U0C1tqDsPcdpyy5I1LbUnXmD8\_O1VGpoH9x4PVw63LSZUdQJ7kYMM3A&usqp=CAY)

These leather sandals from Madewell make a stylish addition to any wardrobe, with a genuine leather upper and leather footbed for lasting comfort. The round-toe design and classic slip-on style let you dress them up or keep things casual. While they run narrow, most reviewers find them quite comfortable once broken in, though sizing up is recommended for best fit. 


### [Madewell The Tayla Sandal](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Madewell+Sandals?utm\_term=madewell-the-tayla-sandal)

![Madewell The Tayla Sandal | Image](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcQhI9KJTG4uRUzNOF3837xlPnDhIOyUYwYmbbK2N-iAqElkxCUSoiWdZzO8vID8EcnfdLkDhAw8bQMXV3rMU7vgo29Pu8wILg&usqp=CAY)

This sleek black sandal combines elegant tube straps with a cushioned MWL Cloudlift Lite insole, keeping feet comfortable despite its 2.5-inch heel height. The leather upper and synthetic sole construction provides durability while maintaining a lightweight feel. Users appreciate the stylish design and versatile pairing potential with both casual and dressy outfits. The true black color stands out while remaining versatile enough to match various wardrobe staples. 


### [Madewell The Charley Double-Strap Slide Sandal](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Madewell+Sandals?utm\_term=madewell-the-charley-double-strap-slide-sandal)

![Madewell The Charley Double-Strap Slide Sandal | Image](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcSFpRcUiHiRKWGqMECVVGdO93ilay\_LQ-SaarViP95xrfeHnv97FKOV\_s4TEv7IGKMdyRox0LgsVyyUwf92W2rZY0vFfeGs&usqp=CAY)

These Madewell leather slide sandals are a stylish addition to any wardrobe, featuring a hidden elastic panel that allows for some stretch in the double-strap design. The 1.5-inch platform and smooth leather insole make them surprisingly comfortable for their height, though some users have noted slight variations in the fit across different sizes. Leather sandals tend to develop character with wear, and while the quality of construction is evident, the peeling insole and thin sole coating require ongoing maintenance. 


### [Madewell The Louisa Woven Slide Sandal](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Madewell+Sandals?utm\_term=madewell-the-louisa-woven-slide-sandal)

![Madewell The Louisa Woven Slide Sandal | Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcTJ3Br-\_twy-JwgblkWnyJAgfDk0A--BjqlIbzQgaUDShag27-jqVPjHuibdB32EqXheORfn1EH43iY6f1Wnnk1AY5T87Pb&usqp=CAY)

These burnished caramel leather slides have become a summer staple for many thanks to their wide woven strap design and MWL Cloudlift Lite cushioning. While the leather construction can take some breaking in, especially around high arches, customers appreciate how the sandals mold to their feet with regular wear. The flexible molded footbed and 1/2-inch heel make them surprisingly comfortable once you've worn them a few times, though some find the leather edges can be a bit stiff at first. 


## Buyer's Guide

Madewell offers a wide range of sandals that blend comfort with style. When selecting your perfect pair, consider several key factors to ensure you find both functionality and fashion. 


### Materials and Construction

Madewell uses various materials for their sandals, including leather, canvas, and synthetic fabrics. Leather options provide durability and a classic look, while canvas and synthetic versions offer lighter weight and breathability. Consider the material's moisture-wicking properties and how they respond to changes in temperature for your intended climate. 


### Arch Support and Footbed

A proper footbed can significantly impact how comfortable your sandals are during extended wear. Look for models with built-in arch support or removable insoles that allow you to customize the fit. The heel design is also important: lower heels generally provide more stability than high heels. 


### Strap Fit and Closure System

The strap design affects both comfort and style. Cross-strap patterns distribute pressure more effectively than single straps, while adjustable closures like sliders or straps with metal hardware allow you to fine-tune the fit. Consider how the straps cross over the foot to prevent slipping and ensure even pressure distribution. 


### Footwear Width and Fit

Madewell offers various width options, from narrow to extra-wide, so it's crucial to measure your foot properly before selecting a size. Pay attention to both the toe box height and ball-of-foot support. If you have wide feet, look for models specifically designed to accommodate this, as standard sandals may cause discomfort. 


## FAQ


### Are Madewell sandals comfortable to wear?

Madewell emphasizes comfort in their sandal designs, with many styles featuring padded footbeds and flexible materials. The brand's popular styles often incorporate arch support and breathable construction to keep feet comfortable during extended wear. 

While individual comfort may vary based on foot type and personal preferences, Madewell's sandals generally balance style with practical comfort for everyday wear. 


### What materials are used in Madewell sandals?

Madewell's sandals blend natural and synthetic materials for durability and comfort. Common materials include leather, suede, mesh, and EVA foam, with some styles featuring canvas or canvas-like alternatives. The construction typically includes rubber soles for grip and support. 

Vegetable-tanned leather and premium suede are used in premium styles, while more casual options may feature water-resistant canvas or synthetic materials for durability in various weather conditions. 


### How do I care for Madewell sandals?

Proper care extends the life of your Madewell sandals and maintains their appearance. Clean the sandals with a soft cloth or brush to remove dirt and debris. For leather and suede styles, use appropriate cleaners and conditioners to protect the materials and prevent cracking. 

Avoid spraying water directly on the sandals, especially for canvas or mesh styles. Instead, wipe down with a damp cloth and allow them to air dry completely before wearing again. Store in a cool, dry place when not in use. 


### What sizes do Madewell sandals come in?

Madewell offers a standard size range, typically from US 5 to 11 for women and 6 to 13 for men. They do not provide half sizes, and the specific sizing can vary slightly between styles. Always check the detailed sizing chart for your preferred style to ensure the best fit. 

For half sizes, consider ordering the next whole size down for a more snug fit. Conversely, if you prefer extra room, opt for the next whole size up. The brand's signature padded insoles provide some additional comfort and flexibility in sizing. 


### Are Madewell sandals suitable for daily wear?

Madewell's everyday styles are designed for regular wear, featuring durable construction and comfortable materials. The padded footbeds, arch support, and breathable mesh options make them suitable for daily use in various settings. 

While the brand excels at casual footwear, their dressier styles may not be as appropriate for work environments requiring closed-toe footwear. Always consider the specific style and occasion when selecting your daily pair. 


### How long do Madewell sandals typically last?

With proper care, Madewell sandals can last 2-4 years with regular daily wear. The longevity depends on several factors, including the quality of materials, frequency of wear, and maintenance. Premium styles made from leather and suede may last longer than canvas or mesh options. 

Regular cleaning and conditioning, along with proper storage, can extend the life of your sandals. Keep them in a cool, dry place when not in use, and consider reconditioning leather and suede styles annually to maintain their quality.
