## Buyer's Guide

Casio dive watches combine precision timing with robust durability, making them a popular choice for underwater enthusiasts and professionals. Understanding the features that make these timepieces reliable and versatile will help you select the right watch for your diving needs. 


### Watch movements

Casio dive watches typically use reliable quartz movements, known for their accuracy and longevity. Some models feature Casio's own proprietary movements, which offer additional functionality and durability. Consider the movement's specifications, such as battery life and shock resistance, to ensure it meets your needs. 


### Water resistance and dive capabilities

Water resistance is measured in meters or atmospheres and indicates how deep the watch can safely be worn. For standard recreational diving, a 200-meter rating is sufficient. Technical divers or freedivers may require watches rated up to 1,000 meters. Additionally, look for watches with appropriate water resistance ratings for specific activities, such as 10,000-meter watches designed for saturation diving. 


### Display and visibility

Casio dive watches often feature illuminated or backlit LCD displays for clear readability in low light conditions. The display should show the time, dive depth, and remaining dive time or no-decompression time. Some models include auxiliary displays for decompression stop times or compass functions. The display size and legibility can significantly impact the watch's usefulness during dives. 


### Strap and case materials

Case materials range from stainless steel for everyday wear to titanium or ceramics for enhanced durability. Straps made from rubber or high-stretch materials provide comfort and floatability in water. The strap attachment system should allow quick removal in emergency situations. Ensure the watch fits properly and securely to prevent accidental loss during dives. 


## FAQ


### What makes a watch dive-rated?

A dive-rated watch must meet strict standards set by organizations like ISO 6425. These specifications include water resistance to at least 200 meters, a unidirectional rotating bezel for tracking elapsed time during decompression stops, and large, luminous numerals and hands for visibility in dark environments. 

Casio's dive watches incorporate these features, with additional enhancements like scratch-resistant sapphire crystal and water-tight pushers to protect the movement. 


### Which Casio dive watches are available in the market?

The most popular Casio dive watches include the Edifice EF-500D-1AVB (men's) and EF-500D-1AVC (women's), along with the Pro Trek PRG-300-1A1 (men's) and PRG-T3000-1A1 (women's). 

All feature durable construction suitable for both recreational and technical diving, with the PRG models offering additional features like barometric altimeter and atmospheric pressure display. 


### What should I consider when choosing a Casio dive watch?

When selecting a Casio dive watch, consider the display visibility in low light, comfort during extended wear, and whether you need additional features like depth measurement or navigation tools. 

Size preferences and strap material should also factor into your decision, as these watches range from 44mm (men's) to 41mm (women's) with interchangeable bands available in metal or rubber. 


### Are Casio dive watches durable enough for technical diving?

Casio dive watches are designed for recreational diving and may not meet the specific requirements of technical diving. For technical use, consider watches from manufacturers like Omega, Rolex, or Sinn. 

While Casio watches are highly durable and reliable for their intended purpose, technical divers often seek certifications and specific features that may not be available in consumer-oriented dive watches. 


### How do I care for my Casio dive watch?

Regularly clean the watch with a soft cloth and mild soap solution, avoiding harsh chemicals. The watch should be serviced every 5-7 years, even if not showing any issues, to maintain waterproof integrity. 

Avoid exposing the watch to extreme temperature changes, and always check the water resistance rating before each dive, as scratches on the crystal or damage to the case can affect waterproofing. 


### What is the battery life of Casio dive watches?

Casio dive watches typically feature solar-powered movements with battery backup. Under normal use, these watches can run for several years before the battery needs replacement. 

The battery should last longer in darker environments where the solar cells receive less light. For optimal performance, avoid exposing the watch to direct sunlight, which can overcharge the battery and potentially damage the electronics.
