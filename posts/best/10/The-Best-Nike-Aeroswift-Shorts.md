## FAQ

![Nike-Aeroswift-Shorts-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Nike-Aeroswift-Shorts-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What makes the Nike Aeroswift Shorts different from other shorts?

The Nike Aeroswift Shorts stand out due to their innovative ventilation technology and lightweight construction. The key feature is their mesh panels that channel airflow around the body, helping to keep you cool during intense workouts or runs. 

The shorts are designed for both men and women, with specific variants offering tailored fit and compression for different body types. They're available in various lengths, from quarter-zip to full-zip styles, to suit different preferences and activities. 


### Are these shorts suitable for all weather conditions?

While the mesh panels excel in hot weather, the shorts are also designed for transitional conditions. The Nike Dri-FIT technology helps wick away moisture and regulate temperature effectively. 

The shorts are not recommended for extremely cold weather, as the ventilation may make them too cooling at very low temperatures. However, they work well in moderate conditions for both training and casual wear. 

![Nike-Aeroswift-Shorts-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Nike-Aeroswift-Shorts-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What materials are the Nike Aeroswift Shorts made from?

The primary material is Nike's proprietary Dri-FIT mesh, blended with spandex for flexibility and a second-skin feel. The mesh panels are specifically engineered to provide breathability while maintaining durability. 

The shorts also feature a moisture-wicking inner layer in strategic areas, such as the waistband and inner leg panels, to prevent chafing and improve comfort during extended wear. 


### How do the compression variants differ from regular Nike Aeroswift Shorts?

The compression shorts feature additional graduated pressure in the leg and thigh areas to enhance blood flow and support during exercise. This design helps reduce muscle vibrations and provides a more locked-in fit. 

The compression version also includes slightly thicker mesh panels for increased ventilation, striking a balance between support and breathability for active wear. 

![Nike-Aeroswift-Shorts-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Nike-Aeroswift-Shorts-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What sizes are available in the Nike Aeroswift Shorts?

The shorts come in a wide range of sizes, from extra small to triple-xlarge, with specific variants offering petite and plus sizes for women. Each variant typically comes in pairs of short and long length options. 

Color options vary by specific style, but common choices include basic black, white, and blue, as well as vibrant neon and graphic patterns for more casual wear. 


### How should I care for my Nike Aeroswift Shorts?

The shorts are machine washable and can be tumble dried on low heat to maintain their shape and elasticity. It's recommended to use a mild detergent and avoid harsh bleach or fabric softeners. 

For best results, air dry the shorts when possible and reshape them while still slightly damp to maintain their form. Periodic air drying between washes can also help preserve the mesh structure and prevent pilling.
