## Buyer's Guide

Union Bay cargo pants combine functionality and durability for outdoor enthusiasts. These pants offer ample storage with multiple pockets, including hidden stash pockets and utility loops. The key considerations when selecting Union Bay cargo pants are material quality, water resistance, pocket organization, and comfort features. 


### Material Quality

Choose pants made from moisture-wicking fabrics that resist abrasion and stretching. Look for reinforced stitching at stress points like the knees and seat for lasting durability. The internal waistband and leg openings should feature elastic or drawstring options for a secure fit without constricting movement. 


### Water Resistance

Select cargo pants with a DWR (Durable Water Repellent) coating to prevent water penetration while allowing moisture vapor to escape. The seat and thigh panels should be more breathable to prevent overheating during active use. Some models offer fully waterproof options suitable for heavy rain conditions. 


### Pocket Organization

A well-organized cargo pant features multiple pockets of varying sizes and types. Look for a utility pocket with a zipper for secure phone storage, a zippered chest pocket for keys, and several smaller pockets for pens, earbuds, and other small items. The arrangement should allow quick access to essential items without rummaging through multiple pockets. 


### Comfort Features

Union Bay cargo pants prioritize comfort with features like four-way stretch for unrestricted movement, moisture-wicking to keep you dry, and ergonomic padded seats. The waistband should incorporate adjustability options for a custom fit, while the leg openings need secure closures to prevent bunching during activity.

The pants work well in temperatures ranging from cold to mild, although additional insulation may be needed for extreme cold. 


### What sizes are available?
