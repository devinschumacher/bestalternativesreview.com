## FAQ


### What makes Farberware knives different from other brands?

Farberware knives feature premium stainless steel blades that resist corrosion and maintain sharpness longer than standard knives. The company combines durable materials with modern designs to create a line of kitchen knives that perform well while remaining stylish. 

Compared to cheaper options, Farberware knives offer better value through their combination of quality construction and reasonable pricing. They sit between basic budget knives and premium brands like WÃ¼sthof, providing excellent performance without the highest price point. 


### Are Farberware knives dishwasher safe?

Most Farberware knives are dishwasher safe, making them convenient for busy kitchens. The company recommends hand washing for certain decorative models, particularly those with detailed engravings or multiple pieces. 

For optimal care, hand wash the knives with mild soap and warm water. After cleaning, dry them thoroughly and store them properly to prevent rust and maintain their sharpness. 


### How do Farberware knives compare in terms of durability?

Farberware knives deliver consistent performance over time, with blades that hold their edge well and resist noticeable wear. The company's commitment to quality ensures that these knives remain sharp longer than many less expensive alternatives. 

While not quite at the level of top-tier brands like Shun or WÃ¼sthof, Farberware knives provide excellent durability for their price point. With regular care, these knives can maintain their edge for years of reliable performance in home kitchens. 


### What steels do Farberware knives use?

Farberware knives typically use 420 stainless steel, a reliable choice that provides durability at an affordable price point. Some higher-end models use 440C stainless steel, known for its excellent corrosion resistance and edge retention. 

The company also offers clad knives with a stainless steel blade and an aluminum core, which helps prevent rust and warping while maintaining the blade's integrity during dishwasher use. 


### How should I store Farberware knives?

Store Farberware knives in a block, sheath, or magnetized strip to prevent damage and maintain their sharpness. Proper storage protects the blades from scratches and other damage that could affect their performance. 

Never store knives directly in a drawer alongside utensils, as the constant movement and potential impact can damage the blades and shorten their lifespan.

Entry-level cooks may prefer the Farberware Classic Cook's Set, which includes a 7-inch chef's knife and 3-inch paring knife at an affordable price point. More experienced cooks might consider the Signature Series, featuring 440C stainless steel and precision grind.
