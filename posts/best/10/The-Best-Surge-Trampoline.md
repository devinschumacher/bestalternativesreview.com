## Buyer's Guide

A surge trampoline combines the fun of jumping with the thrill of height, offering an intense workout session that burns calories and builds strength. These specialized trampolines feature a larger spring system and flexible steel frame designed to handle the extra impact of advanced tricks and stunts. When choosing a surge trampoline, consider the following key factors to ensure you select the right equipment for your needs and skill level. 


### Spring System

Spring quality and quantity significantly impact a trampoline's bounce and durability. High-quality springs made from corrosion-resistant materials like stainless steel offer consistent performance and long-term reliability. The number of springs affects the trampoline's response time and energy transfer, with more springs generally providing better performance. For advanced users, a spring count of at least 144 is recommended to handle complex tricks and landings.

### Frame Design

Steel frames are standard for surge trampolines, with diameter and wall thickness determining the trampoline's load-bearing capacity and longevity. Larger diameter frames distribute stress more effectively, while thicker walls resist deformation under pressure. Premium models feature welded or fused frame construction, which is more resistant to twisting and warping compared to bolted frames. 


### Cushioning and Safety Features

Safety should be the top priority when selecting a surge trampoline. Look for models with impact-absorbing surfaces, such as closed cell foam padding or safety mats, to protect users during jumps and landing. Clear safety cages are essential for preventing falls off the sides, especially for multi-user trampolines. Other safety features include secure netting around the frame, protective rubber coating on springs, and stable base designs to prevent tipping.

### Size and Space Requirements

The installation area's dimensions and clearance determine the appropriate trampoline size. Minimum recommended clearance is 7 feet in all directions for standard trampolines, and 10 feet for larger models with sprung bases. Consider the trampoline's storage requirements when the unit is not in use, as many models need additional space for proper maintenance and protection of the surface and frame.
