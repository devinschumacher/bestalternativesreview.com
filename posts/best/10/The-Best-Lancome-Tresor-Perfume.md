## FAQ


### What makes Lancome Tresor unique?

Developed as a romantic and elegant fragrance, Tresor captures the essence of timeless beauty and sophistication. The perfume combines classic notes with modern accords to create a signature scent that appeals to both traditional and contemporary perfume enthusiasts. 

Each Tresor fragrance includes a carefully curated blend of rose, jasmine, and vetiver, creating a warm, enveloping aroma that develops beautifully over time. The perfume's composition features a combination of natural and synthetic ingredients to achieve its signature character. 


### How does Tresor compare to other Lancome perfumes?

While other Lancome fragrances showcase distinct personalities, Tresor shares a family resemblance through its floral-woody structure and rose-based heart notes. Each scent in the collection brings its own nuances, from the citrusy freshness of La Vie Est Belle to the spicy elegance of La Nuit du Cafe. 

The Tresor fragrance maintains a consistent character across its various formulations, ensuring wearers recognize its distinctive scent profile while appreciating minor variations in composition between different versions. 


### What are the key ingredients in Tresor?

At the core of Tresor's fragrance is a blend of rose absolute, jasmine sambac, and vetiver root. These natural ingredients form the foundation of the scent, providing richness and depth. Modern synthetic materials enhance the composition, adding clarity and longevity to the aroma.
