## Buyer's Guide

Blue placemats enhance both casual and formal dining environments with their versatility and calming presence. These protective table accessories come in various styles and sizes to suit different tastes and occasions.

### Maintenance Requirements

The most common materials - vinyl, melamine, and felt - are easy to maintain. For daily care, wipe them with a damp cloth and mild soap. More premium placemats might require specific care instructions, such as hand washing or avoiding harsh chemicals. 


### Sizing and Quantity

Standard placemat sizes range from 12 to 18 inches in length. Consider the size of the table and dinnerware when choosing dimensions. For large tables or formal settings, consider purchasing multiple placemats or runners that can cover the entire length of the table.
