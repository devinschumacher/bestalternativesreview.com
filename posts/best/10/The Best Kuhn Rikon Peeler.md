### What makes Kuhn Rikon peelers unique?

Kuhn Rikon peelers combine precision engineering with ergonomic design. This Swiss-made kitchen tool features a durable stainless-steel blade that effortlessly removes both the skin and pith of fruits and vegetables with a single pass. 

The peeler's ergonomic handle, made from natural beechwood, reduces hand fatigue during extended use. The tool's weight distribution ensures better control and reduced pressure on the fingers, making it suitable for both novice and experienced cooks. 


### Which fruits and vegetables can I peel with a Kuhn Rikon peeler?

These peelers excel at handling most common fruits and vegetables, including apples, carrots, cucumbers, and potatoes. The blade's narrow profile allows precise removal of skin from curved surfaces and delicate areas. 

While they work on a variety of produce, always exercise caution when peeling items with tough outer layers like citrus fruits, which may require more pressure to remove the skin without damaging the flesh. 


### How do I maintain my Kuhn Rikon peeler?

To keep your peeler in optimal condition, hand wash it after each use with mild soap and warm water. Dry thoroughly before storing to prevent rust. 

If the blade becomes dulled, you can sharpen it using a honing steel or kitchen sharpening stone. Regular maintenance will extend the life of your peeler and ensure it continues to perform at its best. 


### Where should I store my Kuhn Rikon peeler?

Most Kuhn Rikon peelers come with a protective sheath that helps prevent damage during transport and storage. Store the sheathed peeler in a dry place, away from significant heat sources. 

If using the sheath is not practical, consider purchasing a dedicated utensil holder or knife block that can accommodate the peeler's unique shape and size. 


### Are Kuhn Rikon peelers dishwasher safe?

The primary blade and handle of Kuhn Rikon peelers are designed for dishwasher use, making cleaning quick and simple. Simply place the peeler in a dishwasher-safe container to protect the blade during washing. 

If you prefer not to use the dishwasher, hand washing remains the recommended method as it allows for thorough inspection of the peeler's condition and proper cleaning of all parts. 


### How long do Kuhn Rikon peelers typically last?

With proper care, a Kuhn Rikon peeler can last 5-10 years, depending on usage frequency and maintenance practices. The stainless-steel blade and natural beechwood handle are both built to last, though regular sharpening may be necessary for optimal performance over time. 

Signs that indicate it's time to replace your peeler include noticeable dulling of the blade, cracking of the handle, or difficulty maintaining a consistent peeling motion.
