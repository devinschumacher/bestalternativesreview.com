## Buyer's Guide

Polygel nails offer a blend of natural nail health and salon-quality results, making them a popular choice for those seeking longer-lasting manicures. These nails combine the best properties of gel nails with a more breathable, flexible matrix that's easier on the natural nail. 


### Material Composition

Polygel nails are typically made from a blend of acrylic and gel materials, creating a hybrid that's more flexible and less brittle than pure acrylic nails. The matrix should contain at least 20% gel to maintain strength while allowing for natural nail growth. 

High-quality polygel products will include ingredients like biotin for nail strengthening and moisturizers to prevent dryness. Avoid formulations that contain harsh chemicals or excessive amounts of formaldehyde or toluene.

### Installation Process

The installation should be a two-step process: first, the natural nail is prepared and a base coat is applied. Then, the polygel nail material is sculpted and cured under UV light. The entire process usually takes between 30-60 minutes per hand. 

Ensure the technician creates a strong bond between the natural nail and the polygel material by using proper adhesives and following proper filing techniques. This will prevent lift and increase the longevity of the nails. 


### Maintenance Requirements

With proper care, polygel nails can last 2-3 weeks before retouching is needed. Weekly home maintenance includes filing down lift edges, applying cuticle oil, and keeping nails dry for at least 30 minutes after water exposure. 

Avoid removing polygel nails with harsh removal solutions or by filing down the nail plate. Instead, use a gentle nail buffer and cuticle pusher to maintain shape and prevent lifting.

### Cost Considerations

Polygel nails generally cost between $50-70 per set, making them a mid-range option compared to full acrylic nails or traditional gel nails. The initial investment in high-quality products and tools can save money in the long term by reducing frequent service visits. 

Consider purchasing at least a 12-month supply of professional-grade products to ensure consistent results and longevity of your nails. 


## FAQ

![Polygel-Nails-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Polygel-Nails-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are Polygel nails?

Polygel nails are a popular nail enhancement option that combines the benefits of gel nails with traditional nail care. These nail extensions are created by bonding a layer of flexible gel material to the natural nail, providing strength, durability, and a natural-looking finish. 

The polygel system typically consists of a base coat, multiple layers of gel, and a clear top coat. This multi-step process allows for customization in length, shape, and texture, making it suitable for various nail styles and preferences. 


### How long do Polygel nails last?

With proper care, Polygel nails can last 2-3 weeks before needing a refill or touch-up. This is similar to the longevity of standard gel nails and requires regular maintenance to maintain optimal strength and appearance. 

During this period, you can expect your nails to remain strong, with minimal chipping or breaking. However, factors such as nail-biting habits, frequent water exposure, and active lifestyles may shorten their lifespan. 

![Polygel-Nails-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Polygel-Nails-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Are Polygel nails safe for all nail types?

Most people with healthy natural nails can safely wear Polygel nails. However, individuals with brittle nails, severe nail disorders, or allergies to acrylic or gel products should consult a professional before proceeding. 

Before applying Polygel nails, your technician will assess your nail condition and suggest the most appropriate treatment to ensure both comfort and safety. 


### What maintenance is required for Polygel nails?

To maintain your Polygel nails, it's important to keep them clean and moisturized. Regular hand washing and applying a proper hand lotion can prevent dryness and maintain the nails' flexibility. 

For best results, schedule regular professional maintenance appointments every 2-3 weeks. This allows your technician to check for any issues and perform touch-ups to maintain the desired length and shape. 

![Polygel-Nails-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Polygel-Nails-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Are Polygel nails suitable for nail art and designs?

Yes, Polygel nails are ideal for nail art applications. The flexible gel material allows for precise designs and intricate patterns that can last throughout the nail's lifecycle. 

Before adding nail art, it's recommended to speak with your technician about their experience with designs. They can provide guidance on which patterns will work best and how to maintain the finished look. 


### How should I care for my Polygel nails at home?

Avoid placing your hands in harsh chemicals like bleach or industrial cleaners, as these can damage your new nail extensions. When cleaning your hands, use lukewarm water and mild soap to prevent drying out the gel material. 

Avoid using aggressive hand-drying methods, such as rubbing your hands vigorously with a towel. Instead, pat them dry gently to maintain the integrity of your Polygel nails.
