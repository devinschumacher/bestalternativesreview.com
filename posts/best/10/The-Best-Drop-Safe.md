## Buyer's Guide

Drop safe products offer exceptional protection by withstanding falls from significant heights, making them ideal for valuable items like jewelry or electronics. Understanding their capabilities and limitations ensures you select the right product for your needs. 


### Key Specifications

Drop safe models typically measure between 12-20 inches in height and can protect items weighing up to 100 pounds. The maximum drop height varies by model, generally ranging from 6 to 12 feet. 


### Mortise vs. Mortise-Less Locks

Mortise locks offer superior protection with their deep-set mechanism concealed in the door frame. Mortise-less locks provide adequate security while requiring fewer installation materials. Consider the style and construction of your door when choosing a lock type. 


### Material and Build Quality

Steel construction provides the most durable frame, while mortise locks enhance security with their concealed mechanism. Quality manufacturers use tempered glass or reinforced acrylic for the bezel, offering both protection and visibility. 


### Installation and Integration

Standard drop safe installation requires 2-3 hours, including preparation and mounting the strike plate. Consider ease of access for regular use and potential impact on your door's opening mechanism. 


## FAQ


### What is a drop safe?

A drop safe is an electronic safe designed to protect cash and valuables from damage caused by accidental drops. These safes feature specialized shock-absorbing mechanisms to handle impacts and maintain the security of stored items. 

Drop safes are particularly useful for businesses and homes where cash handling is common, and there's a risk of accidental drops during transport or storage. 


### How much weight can a drop safe typically handle?

Most drop safe models are rated to handle between 50-100 pounds of weight. This capability helps protect both small and large quantities of cash and documents. 

Heavier safes often come with additional features like reinforced doors and thicker walls, providing enhanced security for high-volume cash management. 


### What kind of impact protection do drop safes offer?

Drop safes incorporate specialized shock-resistant materials and engineered frames to absorb and distribute impact forces. This design protects contents during accidental drops or handling. 

Some premium models also feature pendulum-tested protection, simulating real-world drop scenarios from various heights to ensure consistent performance. 


### How do drop safes compare to regular safes?

The most common styles include wall-mounted safes with integrated shock protection, freestanding safes with reinforced bases, and portable tabletop units designed for easy relocation. 

Modern drop safes often combine aesthetic appeal with practical functionality, featuring sleek designs that blend with home or office decor. 


### How should I maintain my drop safe?
