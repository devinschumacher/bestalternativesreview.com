## Buyer's Guide

Ariat backpacks combine durable construction with practical features for both casual use and horseback riding. These versatile packs offer organized storage and reliable functionality, making them a popular choice among outdoor enthusiasts. 


### Materials and Durability

Look for backpacks made from rugged materials like nylon or canvas with reinforced stitching. The frames should use high-quality metal or reinforced plastic to resist bending under load. Check for padded, breathable backs and shoulder straps to prevent discomfort during extended wear. 


### Storage and Organization

A good Ariat backpack has multiple pockets for different items, including a main compartment, side pockets, and mesh pouches. The internal organization should allow for easy access to gear while maintaining a streamlined profile. 


### Riding Compatibility

For horseback riders, consider backpacks with adjustable hip belts and compression straps to distribute weight evenly. The pack should sit approximately two inches above the saddle for optimal balance while riding. 


### Size and Fit

Measure your torso length to determine the right backpack size. The backpack should range from two inches below your shoulders to three inches above your hips. Allow about two inches of overlap between your shoulder strap and the pack's top edge for proper fit.
