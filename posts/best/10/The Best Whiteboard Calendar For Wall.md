## Buyer's Guide

A wall-mounted whiteboard calendar combines visual appeal with practical functionality, helping you stay organized while decorating your space. These calendars offer a versatile solution for tracking appointments, planning events, and managing tasks, with features that range from basic to highly customizable. 


### Size and Mounting Options

When selecting a wall-mounted whiteboard calendar, consider the space available and your mounting options. Standard sizes typically range from 12 to 36 inches in diameter. Wall mounts come in various styles, including magnetic, dry-erase backing, or clip-on designs, so choose one that matches your wall type and preferences. 


### Material and Writing Surface

The writing surface material affects both the calendar's durability and ease of use. Magnetic whiteboards require aluminum or steel surfaces that can attract magnetic markers. Dry-erase surfaces work with various marker types but may show ghosting if not completely erased. Some advanced models feature glass fronts or premium whiteboard materials that resist scratches and ghosting. 


### Additional Features

Enhance your calendar's functionality with additional features like reminders, grid patterns, or color-coding options. Some models offer built-in clocks, alarm features, or weather displays. Consider how these extras will affect the calendar's appearance and functionality for your specific needs. 


### Installation and Maintenance

Installation requirements vary based on the mounting type and wall surface. Magnetic options typically require no drilling, while dry-erase models may need mounting hardware. Regular maintenance includes checking the mounting mechanism and ensuring the writing surface remains clean and free from smudges. For longer-term use, consider how easy the calendar is to clean and maintain. 


## FAQ


### What is a whiteboard calendar?

A whiteboard calendar is a wall-mounted calendar that uses writable whiteboard material, typically melamine or markerboard. It allows users to update the date, add events, and make notes using dry-erase markers. 

This interactive format distinguishes whiteboard calendars from traditional paper calendars, offering a more flexible and reusable way to track time and events. 


### How do whiteboard calendars compare to traditional paper calendars?

Unlike paper calendars that become obsolete after one year, whiteboard calendars can be reused year after year. The writable surface allows for quick updates and revisions, making them ideal for home or office settings with changing schedules. 

However, traditional paper calendars have the advantage of portability and instant visual impact, which might be preferred for quick reference or temporary displays. 


### What materials are whiteboard calendars typically made from?

Most whiteboard calendars are constructed from melamine or similar markerboard materials. These panels offer a smooth surface that adheres well to dry-erase markers and erases cleanly without residue. 

Some higher-end models incorporate acrylic or plastic frames with melamine surfaces, providing durability and weather resistance for outdoor or commercial use. 


### How should I maintain a whiteboard calendar?

Regular maintenance involves cleaning the surface with a dry cloth or appropriate cleaning solution to remove dust and marker residue. For stubborn marks, use a mild eraser or marker cleaning solution specifically designed for whiteboards. 

Avoid abrasive materials or harsh chemicals that could damage the surface or leave residue. Hanging the calendar should include proper support to prevent sagging or warping of the whiteboard material. 


### What are the best sizes for wall-mounted whiteboard calendars?

The most common sizes for wall-mounted whiteboard calendars range from 18 inches by 24 inches to 36 inches by 48 inches. These dimensions strike a balance between visibility and practical display space. 

For larger rooms or commercial spaces, consider custom sizes or multiple smaller calendars. Smaller calendars are ideal for personal offices or home study spaces where wall space is limited. 


### Can whiteboard calendars be installed indoors or outdoors?

Whiteboard calendars are generally safe for indoor installations in well-ventilated areas, as they don't contain harmful chemicals. Proper anchoring is crucial to prevent tipping or accidents. 

For outdoor use, choose models specifically rated for environmental exposure. These often feature weather-resistant materials and protective coatings to prevent damage from UV rays, humidity, and temperature changes.
