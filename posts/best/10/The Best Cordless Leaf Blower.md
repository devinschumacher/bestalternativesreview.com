## Buyer's Guide

A cordless leaf blower offers the convenience of battery power with the performance to tackle heavy debris. Understanding key features helps you choose the right model for your needs. 


### Power Source and Runtime

Cordless leaf blowers use either NiCd (nickel-cadmium), NiMH (nickel-metal hydride), or Li-ion batteries. Li-ion provides longer runtime and better performance but is more expensive. Check battery capacity (mAh) and whether the blower uses a single or dual battery system for extended use. 


### Blower Power and Performance

Power is measured in CFM (cubic feet per minute) and MPH (miles per hour). Higher CFM helps clear dense foliage and debris, while higher MPH increases blowing distance. Consider the blower's nozzle types; narrower nozzles increase velocity, while wider ones provide more air volume. 


### Size and Ergonomics

Compact designs reduce operator fatigue, especially for longer use. Ergonomic features like soft grips and adjustable handles improve comfort. The blower's weight distribution affects maneuverability - models with heavier motors towards the center balance better. 


### Additional Features

Look for models with variable speed controls for different tasks. Some have reversible motors for both blowing and vacuuming. Consider blower height adjustment options for different work positions. Safety features like ergonomic triggers and easy-release handles prevent accidental starts. 


## FAQ


### What are the key factors to consider when choosing a cordless leaf blower?

The most important factors are battery life, blower power, and handle design. Look for a blower with a runtime of at least 45 minutes and a powerful motor that can handle heavy debris. The handle should be ergonomically designed for comfort during extended use. 

Additional considerations include the type of leaf guard (fixed vs. adjustable), whether it has a telescoping shaft, and if it includes additional accessories like a crevice tool or vacuum attachment. 


### How do I maintain a cordless leaf blower?

Regular maintenance includes checking the air filter, cleaning the motor housing, and ensuring all connections are tight. Check the battery for proper voltage levels and store it correctly when not in use. 

Before each use, inspect the nozzle, hose, and cordless unit for any damage. After use, thoroughly clean the unit and let it dry completely before storing. 


### What is the difference between blower power and motor power?

Blower power refers to the force of air flow generated by the unit, typically measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM). Motor power is measured in watts or volts and affects the blower's runtime and performance. 

While both impact the unit's effectiveness, more important than pure motor power is the efficiency of how that power is converted into usable air flow. 


### How long do cordless leaf blower batteries last?

Modern lithium-ion batteries typically provide 45-60 minutes of runtime per charge. Actual runtime depends on the power requirements of the unit and the quality of the battery. 

Battery lifespan is measured in charge cycles, with most residential units lasting 300-1,000 cycles under normal use before capacity begins to decline. 


### Are cordless leaf blowers suitable for all types of leaves?

Most cordless leaf blowers can effectively handle dry, light debris like deciduous leaves. However, they may struggle with wet leaves, thick brush, or heavy branches. 

For challenging conditions, consider units with adjustable or fixed guards that can be narrowed for better targeting and increased force. 


### What should I consider about battery compatibility?

Not all cordless leaf blowers use interchangeable batteries. Check if your unit requires a specific battery type (like 18V, 20V, or 60V) and if spare batteries are available. 

If the unit allows battery swapping, note that larger batteries typically provide longer runtime but increase the unit's weight.
