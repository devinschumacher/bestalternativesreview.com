## Buyer's Guide

Trampoline springs are essential components that maintain the elasticity and safety of your trampoline's jumping surface. Understanding their importance and specifications helps you choose the right springs for your equipment, ensuring both performance and longevity. 


### Spring Specifications

When selecting trampoline springs, pay attention to their diameter, wire thickness, and material composition. Standard diameters range from 1.25 inches to 1.5 inches, with wire thickness typically measured in gauge size (thinner gauge indicates thicker wire). Common materials include galvanized steel for outdoor use and stainless steel for corrosion resistance in both indoor and outdoor environments. 


### Spring Quantity and Spacing

The number and spacing of springs depend on your trampoline's size and design. Small backyard trampolines may require 32-48 springs, while larger models can have up to 64 springs. Spacing should be consistent across all legs, with each spring supporting approximately 18 inches of frame. Properly spaced springs distribute weight evenly, reducing stress on individual components and improving overall stability. 


### Installation Requirements

Proper installation techniques are crucial for extending spring lifespan and maintaining trampoline safety. Springs should be evenly tightened using specialized spring wavers, with tension adjusted until they extend 1/8 inch when compressed. Regular inspection for wear, corrosion, or fraying ensures continued safe operation. Replacing worn or damaged springs promptly prevents premature failure and potential hazards. 


### Maintenance Considerations

Regular maintenance extends the life of trampoline springs and ensures optimal performance. Weekly inspections for corrosion, rust, or looseness identify potential issues early. Applying protective coatings or lubricants on metal springs reduces wear and prevents moisture damage. In high-use environments, consider replacing springs annually to maintain safety standards and equipment longevity. 


## FAQ


### What are trampoline springs and why are they important?

Trampoline springs are the flexible metal bars that connect the jumping mat to the frame. They store and release energy when you jump, making the trampoline springy. Proper spring function is crucial for safety and performance, ensuring a consistent bounce and preventing accidents. 

Each spring must be tested for its load capacity, which varies based on the trampoline's size and intended use. Springs rated too low for the system can cause premature failure, while those rated too high can be dangerous. 


### How many springs should a typical backyard trampoline have?

A standard backyard trampoline with a 12-foot diameter requires 144 springs, typically arranged in 12 rows of 12. Some models come with fewer, particularly cheaper versions, so verify the number matches your trampoline's specifications. 

Commercial-grade trampolines may require more springs, up to 192 or more, depending on their size and construction. Always check the manufacturer's recommendations for your specific model. 


### What materials are trampoline springs made from?

Most trampoline springs are made from high-carbon steel, known for its resilience and ability to maintain shape under repeated stress. Premium models may use stainless steel for enhanced durability and resistance to corrosion. 

The diameter ranges from 1/4 to 1/2 inch, with 3/8-inch being standard for backyard trampolines. Smaller or larger diameters may affect the spring's performance and lifespan. 


### How do you measure trampoline springs?

Measure the spring's length from the inner bend to the inner bend, not including the ends. Standard lengths range from 4.25 to 5.75 inches, with premium models offering longer options for enhanced bounce quality. 

Measure the diameter at its thickest point and check the wire thickness. Most springs measure 0.125 to 0.166 inches in diameter, with 0.155 inches being common. 


### What should you consider when buying trampoline springs?

Consider the spring's load rating, which determines how much weight it can safely support. The rating should match the trampoline's recommended weight capacity and distribution. 

Check the spring's corrosion protection method. Galvanization is standard, but some models use additional coatings or stainless steel for extended durability. 


### How often should you inspect trampoline springs?

Inspect all springs after each use to check for visible damage, unusual wear patterns, or loose connections. Regular inspections should be part of your trampoline maintenance routine. 

If you use your trampoline frequently, plan to replace springs every 5-7 years, depending on usage intensity and environmental factors. Always replace springs in sets of 12 to maintain consistent performance and safety.
