## Buyer's Guide

A dash griddle is a compact cooking appliance that offers versatility and convenience for preparing delicious meals. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the right griddle for your cooking needs. 


### Size and Space

Dash griddles come in various sizes, typically measuring between 12 to 18 inches. Consider how much cooking surface you need based on your meal sizes and the types of dishes you plan to prepare. Compact models save counter space while larger ones offer more cooking area.
