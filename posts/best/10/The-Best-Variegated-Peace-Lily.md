## Buyer's Guide

Variegated peace lilies (Spathiphyllum wallisii 'Graziella') combine elegant white blooms with striking green and cream foliage, making them a popular choice for indoor gardening. Their ability to thrive in low light and filter air pollutants adds to their appeal as a houseplant. 


### Light Requirements

These tropical plants prefer indirect bright light but will scorch in direct sunlight. An east- or west-facing windowsill works well, while north-facing windows may be too dim.

### Watering Needs

Maintain consistently moist soil but be careful not to overwater, as peace lilies resent soggy conditions. Water when the top inch of soil feels dry, allowing the pot to drain completely afterward. 


### Potting and Soil

Use a well-draining potting mix specifically formulated for tropical plants. Repot every 1-2 years in a container that's 1-2 inches larger, preferably with feet to prevent pooling water at the bottom.

### Temperature and Humidity

Aim for a consistent temperature between 65-85°F (18-29°C). These plants are particularly sensitive to cold drafts, so avoid placing them near windows or doors. They thrive in humid environments, benefited by occasional misting or placement on a humidity tray. 


## FAQ

![Variegated-Peace-Lily-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Variegated-Peace-Lily-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a variegated peace lily?

Variegated peace lilies are ornamental houseplants featuring distinctive white, cream, and green striped leaves. These tropical plants belong to the same genus as the more common white peace lily but display a strikingly different leaf pattern. 

This variegation occurs naturally in about 1% of peace lily plants and results from a genetic mutation. The creamy and green stripes create a visually appealing contrast against the dark green foliage, making them popular among indoor garden enthusiasts. 


### How do I care for a variegated peace lily?

These plants thrive in indirect sunlight, requiring a bright location away from direct sunlight to prevent leaf burn. Place them near east- or west-facing windows for optimal light conditions. 

Water the plant when the top inch of soil feels dry, ensuring the soil remains consistently moist but not waterlogged. Use room temperature water to avoid shocking the roots. Maintain humidity levels above 50% through occasional misting or placing a humidifier nearby. 

![Variegated-Peace-Lily-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Variegated-Peace-Lily-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How often should I fertilize my variegated peace lily?

Feed your variegated peace lily once every two weeks during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced houseplant fertilizer diluted to half strength. 

Reduce fertilization to monthly intervals during fall and winter when the plant's growth slows. Over-fertilization can lead to leaf yellowing and reduced variegation, so it's important to follow these guidelines carefully. 


### Can variegated peace lilies be propagated?

Yes, variegated peace lilies can be propagated through stem cuttings. The best time to propagate is in spring when the plant is actively growing. 

Take 4-6 inch stem cuttings with at least two leaves and plant them in a well-draining potting mix. Keep the soil consistently moist and place the cutting in a warm, humid environment with indirect sunlight until roots form, typically within 4-6 weeks. 

![Variegated-Peace-Lily-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Variegated-Peace-Lily-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do I promote healthy growth?

Regularly dust the leaves to maintain air flow and proper photosynthesis. Use a soft cloth or gentle spray of water to remove dust without damaging the delicate foliage. 

Monitor for pests such as aphids and spider mites, which can affect both the leaves and new growth. Treat infestations promptly using insecticidal soap or neem oil to prevent damage to the variegation. 


### What are the common problems with variegated peace lilies?

Variegated peace lilies may experience leaf yellowing due to overwatering, low light conditions, or excessive fertilizer. Adjust care as needed to address these issues. 

The loss of variegation can occur if the plant is stressed by environmental factors such as extreme temperatures, poor lighting, or improper watering. Maintaining consistent care practices will help preserve the plant's distinctive color pattern.
