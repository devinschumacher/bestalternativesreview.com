### What are the key features of the Titleist T400 Irons?

The Titleist T400 Irons combine tour-inspired performance with player-friendly design. Key features include a cup-face construction for increased ball speed, a neutral-biased moment of inertia for improved forgiveness, and a refined look that matches the brand's premium reputation. 

The irons feature a slightly thinner topline for added perimeter weighting, while maintaining the characteristic soft black PVD finish that has become a signature element of modern Titleist designs. 


### How do the T400 Irons compare to other recent Titleist designs?

Compared to the T200, the T400 offers more perimeter weighting for increased forgiveness while maintaining similar ball speeds. It builds upon the T100's foundation by introducing subtle design improvements and modern materials for enhanced performance.

### What are the weight options available for the T400 sets?

The T400 Irons are available with a choice of 38-g or 44-g options. The lighter 38-g version features standard 36-g steel shafts, while the 44-g set includes 44-g True Temper Dynamic Gold steel shafts. Both options are offered in right-hand configuration only. 

The 44-g set provides a more traditional iron feel with slightly more mass in the hands, while the 38-g configuration maintains the lighter feel of modern irons. 


### Can the T400 Irons be customized with premium shaft options?

While the standard sets include either 38-g or 44-g steel shafts, Titleist offers several customization options for players who prefer graphite or more expensive steel alternatives. The company recommends using professional fitting services to select the right shaft for individual swing characteristics and preferences. 

Common premium shaft choices include Fujikura Solite, Mitsubishi Rayon Tensei, and Grafuri models, though specific availability may vary by country and retailer.

### What is the recommended swing speed range for the T400 Irons?

The Titleist T400 Irons are recommended for players with swing speeds between 75 and 95 mph. This range covers most mid- to high-handicap players who swing between these speeds. 

While the T400 provides increased forgiveness, players with slower swings (under 75 mph) might benefit from more perimeter weighting, while those with faster swings (over 95 mph) may prefer lighter 38-g options. 


### How do the T400 Irons perform in harsh weather conditions?

The T400 Irons are designed to perform well in various weather conditions, with a durable cup-face construction that maintains its accuracy and speed regardless of changing atmospheric conditions. 

Like all modern irons, performance can be slightly affected by heavy rain or humidity, but the T400's design focuses on consistency across different environments using materials like soft black PVD and precision-forged construction.
