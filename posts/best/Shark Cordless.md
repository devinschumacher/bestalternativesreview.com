<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Shark+Cordless?utm_term=pet-friendly-shark-cordless-vacuum-with-anti-allergen-complete-seal-and-self-cleaning-brushroll"><img alt="shark-cordless-pet-plus-vacuum-with-anti-allergen-complete-seal-iz361h-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/shark-cordless-pet-plus-vacuum-with-anti-allergen-complete-seal-iz361h-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

However, the self-cleaning brushroll seemed to be more of a hassle than a help. It often got tangled with pet hair, leading me to manually clean it, which wasn't ideal. The HEPA filtration system did a decent job of capturing allergens, but I noticed a slight noise level while using the vacuum. The instruction manual was quite clear, but assembling the vacuum took a bit longer than expected.

But no product is perfect. The occasional loud noise from the vacuum can be a bit startling, especially when I need to vacuum late at night. And as much as I love the built-in dirt detection, sometimes it's a little too sensitive, causing the vacuum to react to the tiniest speck of dust. 

The weight of the vacuum is a pro and a con. On one hand, it's light enough to maneuver around my home without much effort. On the other hand, I wish it was a bit heavier to prevent it from tipping over when I accidentally bump it. 

Overall, the Shark Stratos Cordless Vacuum with Clean Sense IQ (IZ862H) is a powerful addition to any household. Its user-friendly features, strong suction, and versatility make it a vacuuming dream.

This feature is especially appreciated when tackling those stubborn pet messes. The precision charging stand is a great design, eliminating the need for any daily plugging and unplugging. 

While the vacuum has its pros, there are a couple of minor cons as well.

Look for a model with a lightweight and ergonomic design for ease of use. Make sure to choose a vacuum with a reliable telescopic handle, so you can adjust its height to suit your comfort.
