### [Keen Women's Mosey Chelsea Leather Boot - Safari/Birch (size 11)](https://serp.ly/amazon/Keen+Boots?utm\_term=keen-womens-mosey-chelsea-leather-boot-safari-birch-size-11)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Keen+Boots?utm_term=keen-womens-mosey-chelsea-leather-boot-safari-birch-size-11"><img alt="keen-womens-mosey-chelsea-leather-safari-birch-12" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/keen-womens-mosey-chelsea-leather-safari-birch-12/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Recently, I decided to give the Keen Women's Mosey Chelsea Leather boots a try in my daily life. As a fan of Keen brand, I was excited to see how these slip-on shoes performed. 

First and foremost, I noticed the roomy fit, which allowed generous room for my toes, just as the highlights suggested. However, I noticed that the toe bumper was causing discomfort in my right foot, even after switching between two sizes. The removable, dual density sole with arch support did offer some comfort, but it wasn't enough to alleviate the issue completely. 

Moving on, the leather upper was quite beautiful, making a nice addition to my wardrobe. While the cork-infused outsole provided a good grip, the softness of the leather caused the boots to stretch out quickly, making them less wearable after just a few weeks. This proved to be a bit of a downside, especially since I didn't have any issues with the environmental preferences. 

Overall, the Keen Women's Mosey Chelsea Leather boots offered a classic style and comfortable slip-on design, but there were a few drawbacks, such as the issue with the toe bumper and the quick stretching of the leather. While these may not be deal-breakers for everyone, they were certainly noticeable in my experience.

### [Keen Men's Targhee Lace High Waterproof Winter Boot with Cozy Insulation for Winter Trails](https://serp.ly/amazon/Keen+Boots?utm\_term=keen-mens-targhee-lace-high-waterproof-winter-boot-with-cozy-insulation-for-winter-trails)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Keen+Boots?utm_term=keen-mens-targhee-lace-high-waterproof-winter-boot-with-cozy-insulation-for-winter-trails"><img alt="keen-mens-targhee-lace-high-waterproof-boot-11-black-raven-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/keen-mens-targhee-lace-high-waterproof-boot-11-black-raven-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I appreciated the charcoal bamboo insulation, which gave a nice warm feel to my feet throughout the colder months. The boots were comfortable and provided good support while walking on icy streets and snowy paths. The waterproof build made them suitable for damp weather and ensured my feet stayed dry even in wet conditions. 

However, I started noticing some issues after a few months of use. The heel brake didn't feel as pronounced, which made it less stable and provided less traction in snowy conditions. The soles also needed some improvement, as they didn't offer the best grip on ice-covered surfaces, requiring me to use micro spikes or crampons.

The rubber sole adds an extra layer of protection while I'm out and about, and the fold-down collar is a game-changer in terms of adaptability. The energy-returning KEEN.

I couldn't believe how comfortable these boots are in the hot summer months – a real breath of fresh air compared to the old-school, heavy-duty work boots I used to wear. 

That's not to say there were no downsides. For a start, the sizing seemed a bit off – I ended up having to get my usual size, a 9, and they were a perfect fit. I guess I'm grateful they didn't make me go down a size. The ankle support was also a bit lacking, which may not be an issue for some, but it's a feature I've come to expect from a good work boot.
