### [Traditional 16" Buffalo Tambourine Hand Drum for Native American Inspired Rhythms](https://serp.ly/amazon/Tambourine?utm\_term=traditional-16-buffalo-tambourine-hand-drum-for-native-american-inspired-rhythms)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Tambourine?utm_term=traditional-16-buffalo-tambourine-hand-drum-for-native-american-inspired-rhythms"><img alt="16-inch-buffalo-tambourine-hand-drum-by-trademark-innovations-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/16-inch-buffalo-tambourine-hand-drum-by-trademark-innovations-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Last summer, I started getting into the Native American culture, you know, their stories, music, and traditions. So, when I stumbled across the 16-inch Buffalo Tambourine Hand Drum by Trademark Innovations, I knew it was the perfect addition to my collection. 

I absolutely loved the look of it. It's a massive hand drum, measuring 16 inches in diameter and 3.5 inches in height, made from real cattle hide and paulownia wood. It's truly a beautiful symbol of Native American culture. And honestly? It played like a charm. 

But it didn't just end with the aesthetics. The drum came with a rubber-headed mallet, which felt comfortable in my hand—like the right tool for the job. And the sound? It was so rich and resonant. 

However, there's one thing that I think could use a bit of improvement: the size. While it's aesthetically appealing, it can be a bit unwieldy to carry around. 

Overall, the 16-inch Buffalo Tambourine Hand Drum by Trademark Innovations is a fantastic addition to any music lover's collection. It's a touch tricky to carry around, but if you can overlook that, you'll find yourself beating out rhythms in no time.

## Buyer's Guide

Welcome to our comprehensive buyer's guide for tambourines! This section will help you understand the essential features, considerations, and tips for selecting the best tambourine that suits your needs. Whether you're a professional musician, a hobbyist, or just starting out, we've got you covered. 

A tambourine is a small, handheld musical instrument typically made of metal or plastic. It consists of a series of metal or plastic jingles arranged around a metal or plastic frame and a striking surface. The instrument produces a bright, sharp sound when struck with a small rod or stick, making it ideal for various musical styles, like Latin, folk, and even rock. 


### Material and Construction

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Tambourine"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Tambourine-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Tambourine-2" height="540"></a></div>

One of the primary factors to consider when purchasing a tambourine is the construction material. Most tambourines are made of metal, such as brass, steel, or aluminum, or plastic. Metal tambourines generally produce a louder, more resonant sound and are more durable. However, plastic tambourines are lighter, less expensive, and often come with built-in cymbals for added versatility. 


### Size and Weight

Another important aspect to consider is the size and weight of the tambourine. Smaller, lighter tambourines are easier to carry and may be better suited for beginners or those with limited hand strength. However, larger tambourines typically produce a fuller, richer sound and provide greater control over volume. If you plan to travel with your tambourine or need to store it in a small space, consider the size carefully.

### What is a tambourine and how does it work?

A tambourine is a rhythm instrument that consists of a metal or plastic frame with jingles (metal discs) attached to it. It is usually played by striking the surface of the frame with a hand or a drumstick, causing the jingles to make a tinkling sound. The sound produced can vary based on the type of jingles, the size and shape of the frame, and the way the tambourine is played. 

Playing a tambourine involves holding it by the handle with one hand, and striking the frame with the other hand or drumstick. The angle at which you hold the tambourine and the strength of your strike will determine the volume and pitch of the sound produced. Tambourines are commonly used in various musical genres, such as folk, pop, and classical music, and are often featured in percussion ensembles and drum lines.

Regular cleaning is essential to maintain the tambourine's sound quality, appearance, and hygiene. The most common cleaning method involves using a soft cloth or paper towel and a mild soap solution. Begin by dampening the cloth or paper towel with a small amount of water, then apply a few drops of soap and gently rub the exterior surface of the frame and jingles. Be sure not to get any soap inside the instrument, as this may cause rust or damage to the metal components. 

Rinse the tambourine with a clean, damp cloth to remove any soap residue, then use a dry cloth to dry it thoroughly. If any of the jingles are loose or detached, gently twist them back into place without applying excessive force. It is essential to avoid using harsh chemicals, abrasive materials, or high-pressure water, as this may damage the tambourine's finish or weaken its components.

### What are some popular tambourine playing techniques?

Tambourine playing techniques can vary depending on the desired sound and the type of tambourine being used. However, some common techniques include the following: 
1) Striking the surface of the frame with a hand or a drumstick: This is the most basic and common technique for playing a tambourine. Striking with different parts of the hand (fingertips, palm, or wrist) or using a drumstick can produce different sounds, from soft and subtle to loud and sharp. 

2) Holding the tambourine with one hand and striking with the other: This technique is often used in Latin or Afro-Cuban music, where the tambourine is held by one hand while playing a percussion instrument, such as a conga or bongo, with the other hand. This allows for more complex rhythms and syncopation. 3) Shaking the tambourine while playing another instrument: In this technique, the tambourine is strapped around the wrist or forearm and played with a drumstick or hand. This allows for continuous, rhythmic accompaniment while playing another instrument, such as a guitar or keyboard.
