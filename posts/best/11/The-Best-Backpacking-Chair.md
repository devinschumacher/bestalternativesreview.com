At just 11.4 pounds, this portable cot packs down small enough for quick trips to the park or beach, though reviewers note it's more like a sturdy lawn chair than advertised. The plastic frame supports up to 500 pounds and offers four adjustable positions, but the thin "mattress" made of compressed fabric isn't very comfortable. Some complained about the chair's small size and flimsy build quality, while others appreciated the foldable design and UV-blocking materials. 


## Buyer's Guide

Backpacking chairs offer a comfortable sit-down alternative to the ground, combining portability with practical features for outdoor adventures. When selecting a backpacking chair, several key factors will influence your choice, from weight and packability to comfort features and material quality. 


### Portability and Packability

The weight and size when packed are crucial for backpacking chairs. Look for lightweight materials like aluminum, titanium, or high-strength plastic. The chair should collapse or compact into a small form for easy storage and transport. Consider the packing volume to ensure it fits comfortably in your backpack.

### Comfort Features

Padding and sit comfort vary significantly between models. Well-padded seat surfaces can prevent pressure sores during long sits. Consider features like lumbar support, backrest angles, and seat shapes that accommodate different body types. Some chairs incorporate air chambers or memory foam for enhanced comfort. 


### Weather Resistance and Durability

Materials must resist moisture and withstand outdoor conditions. Look for chairs made from water-resistant or waterproof fabrics. The frame should be robust enough to support your weight while resisting dents or deformation. Check the manufacturer's durability claims and customer reviews for lasting quality.

### Maintenance and Cleaning

Evaluate how easily you can maintain and clean your chair. Simple designs with fewer parts typically require less maintenance. Look for materials that resist staining and are easy to wipe clean. Some chairs come with specific care instructions that affect long-term maintenance requirements. 


## FAQ

![Backpacking-Chair-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Backpacking-Chair-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a backpacking chair?

A backpacking chair is a portable, lightweight seating solution designed for outdoor enthusiasts who need a comfortable resting spot while hiking, camping, or backpacking. It combines durability with minimal weight to help you enjoy your outdoor adventures without carrying unnecessary bulk. 

These chairs are specifically engineered for backpacking trips where tent space is limited, and traditional camping chairs are too heavy to carry. They're ideal for use in backcountry locations, along trails, or anywhere you need a place to sit and rest during your journey. 


### What are the main benefits of using a backpacking chair?

Backpacking chairs offer several advantages, including reduced weight compared to traditional camping chairs, increased portability, and improved comfort during long days on the trail. By providing a more secure and stable seated position than rocks or logs, they help prevent fatigue and injuries associated with less comfortable resting spots. 

These chairs also enable you to maintain proper posture while resting, which is crucial for preventing back pain during extended backpacking trips. The lightweight design allows you to carry one without significantly impacting your overall load, making them a practical addition to any backpacking setup.

### What features should I look for when choosing a backpacking chair?

The most important features to consider are weight, size, material durability, and seat stability. Look for chairs that weigh less than 3 pounds for optimal portability, and choose materials like aluminum or durable plastic that maintain their shape over time. The seat should have a wide base and deep padding for maximum stability and comfort during use. 

Additional features like built-in cup holders, footrest attachments, or waterproof covers can enhance functionality, but prioritize weight and stability first. You should also test different designs to find one that provides the right balance of comfort and support for your body type. 


### How do backpacking chairs compare to sit-on-top backpacking stools?

Both backpacking chairs and stools serve similar purposes of providing a secure resting spot while backpacking, but they differ in design and functionality. Stools typically have a simpler, more vertical design that's easier to pack and set up, making them a good option for quick rest stops. 

Chairs, on the other hand, offer a more stable and comfortable seated position with wider bases and deeper seats. They're better suited for extended rest periods and provide more support during meal times or rest breaks. Consider your specific needs and how you plan to use the chair when making your choice. 

![Backpacking-Chair-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Backpacking-Chair-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can I use a backpacking chair in various weather conditions?

Modern backpacking chairs are designed to handle most weather conditions, with many featuring water-resistant or waterproof materials and built-in footrests that can double as a rain protection shield. When using your chair in inclement weather, consider bringing a ground tarp or tent footprint to prevent the seat cushion from getting wet. 

For extremely cold conditions, look for chairs with adjustable armrests that can be tucked away to create a more compact shape when not in use. You may also want to bring a chair cover to protect it during transport and to maintain its shape in freezing temperatures. 


### Is a backpacking chair worth the investment?

A quality backpacking chair can significantly enhance your comfort and safety during long days on the trail, making it a worthwhile investment for serious backpackers and outdoor enthusiasts. While they require an initial financial commitment, the reduced weight compared to carrying multiple rock or log resting spots often results in a more enjoyable and efficient backpacking experience. 

Additionally, the chair doubles as a cooking platform for hanging pots or hanging food from trees, adding practical functionality to your backpacking kit. This versatility makes it a valuable addition to your gear collection, especially for multi-day trips where proper resting spots are limited or unavailable.
