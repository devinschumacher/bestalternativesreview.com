## Buyer's Guide

Blackstone griddles are popular for their versatility in cooking various foods simultaneously. These stovetop appliances can handle everything from pancakes to grilled cheese, making them a focal point for many kitchen countertops. 


### Size and Capacity

Consider the cooking surface size that best matches your meal preparation needs. For everyday use, a 36-inch surface offers ample space for multiple servings. Think about how much food you typically cook at once when selecting between smaller, medium, and large options. 


### Cooking Surfaces

The top plate material is crucial for performance. Blackstone griddles usually feature a cast iron top plate with a ceramic coating. Evaluate whether you prefer a smooth surface for precision cooking or a non-stick coating for easier food release. 

Note that cast iron requires more maintenance but delivers superior heat retention and even cooking. Ceramic-coated surfaces are easier to clean and maintain but may not conduct heat as efficiently. 


### Power and Heat Control

Most Blackstone griddles use natural gas, though some models offer electric options. Natural gas provides consistent heat, while electricity offers portability and easier temperature control through electric burners. 

Look for griddles with adjustable heat settings to accommodate different cooking methods. Proper temperature control is essential for everything from delicate pancakes to robust steaks. 


### Maintenance Requirements

Cast iron surfaces need regular seasoning to prevent rust and maintain the non-stick surface. This involves cooking with oil and applying a thin layer after each use. Ceramic-coated surfaces typically require less maintenance, but you should still ensure proper cleaning and protection from scratches. 

Since these griddles sit directly on your cooktop, consider the overall height and weight for countertop clearance and stability. Most models are designed to be stable, but check the specific dimensions for your kitchen setup.
