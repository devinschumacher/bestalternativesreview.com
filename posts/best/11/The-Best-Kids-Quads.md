## FAQ


### What is a kids quad?

A kids quad is a small, motorized vehicle designed for young children to ride. It typically features 4 wheels and is powered by an electric motor, making it easier for kids to move around than traditional bicycles. 

These vehicles are specifically engineered with safety features and a smaller frame size to accommodate children, usually between the ages of 3-12 years old. 


### What age range is suitable for kids quads?

Most kids quads are designed for children between 3 and 12 years old, depending on the model's specifications. Younger children may need to ride on smaller models, while older children can use larger, more powerful vehicles. 

The manufacturer's recommended age range should always be followed to ensure proper size and safety. 


### What safety features should I look for in a kids quad?

Key safety features include sturdy handbrakes, reliable footbrakes, a well-placed kill switch, and adjustable seat height. The vehicle should also have durable construction, impact-absorbing materials in the frame, and clear visibility for the rider. 

Brakes should be responsive and independent, with at least 2 braking systems (hand and foot) for added security. The vehicle's center of gravity should be low and stable for better control. 


### How do I choose the right size kids quad?

Select a quad that matches your child's height and weight. Most manufacturers provide size charts or weight capacity guidelines. The seat height should allow the child to place both feet flat on the ground while sitting. 

Ensure the handlebars are adjustable if the quad can fit different heights. Test ride the vehicle to make sure the child can reach the controls comfortably. 


### What is the typical range of a kids quad?

Electric kids quads usually have a range between 3-10 miles, depending on the battery capacity and motor efficiency. Factors like weight, terrain, and speed can affect the actual range. 

The display screen on the quad typically shows the remaining power, helping you plan your rides and return home before the battery runs out. 


### How do I maintain a kids quad?

Regular maintenance includes checking tire pressure weekly, lubricating the chain monthly, and cleaning the vehicle after each use. The battery should be charged and discharged according to the manufacturer's instructions. 

Store the quad in a dry place when not in use. Check the brakes and steering annually for proper function. Refer to the owner's manual for specific maintenance requirements.
