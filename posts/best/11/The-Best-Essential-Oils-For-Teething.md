## Buyer's Guide

Teething can be a challenging time for both babies and parents, but the right essential oils can help soothe those uncomfortable symptoms. When selecting teething oils, look for combinations of anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties to provide effective relief. 


### Effective Anti-inflammatory Properties

Essential oils with potent anti-inflammatory compounds can reduce swelling and discomfort during teething. Look for oils rich in sesquiterpenes, like lavender and marjoram, which have natural anti-inflammatory effects.

### Powerful Antioxidants

Antioxidants protect the body's cells from damage and can help alleviate teething pain. oils high in antioxidants include frankincense, which also possesses antimicrobial properties that can prevent infections around the gums. 


### Safe Skin Application

When applying essential oils directly to your baby's skin, always dilute them with a carrier oil like coconut or jojoba to prevent irritation. A general rule is to use 1-2 drops of essential oil per teaspoon of carrier oil for topically application.

### Safe Oral Usage

For oral applications, such as placing oil under the tongue, never use neat (undiluted) essential oils. Instead, use a carrier oil like fractionated coconut oil to dilute the essential oils before administration. Always consult with a qualified aromatherapist before introducing oral essential oil therapy to a child.

### Which essential oils are safe for teething infants?

Only a few essential oils are considered safe for topical use on infants under 12 months. Research suggests that lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) and chamomile (Matricaria recutita) may help soothe teething pain. Always use these oils in a carrier oil and perform a patch test first. 

Tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) and peppermint (Mentha piperita) should be avoided as they can be irritating or potentially harmful to young children with developing systems. 


### How should essential oils be applied for teething relief?

Use only 1-2 drops of a safe oil in 1 tablespoon of carrier oil (like fractionated coconut oil). Apply a small amount to your fingertips and massage gently around the gums, avoiding the actual teeth. Limit use to once daily to avoid overload on the developing system. 

Ensure the oil mixture is at room temperature before application, as very warm oils can cause discomfort.

### Can essential oils completely replace conventional teething remedies?

While some parents find essential oils effective, they should not replace proven pain relief methods such as safe teething rings, frozen washcloths, or recommended medications from your pediatrician. Essential oils are meant to complement, not replace, standard care. 

Always consult your child's healthcare provider before adding new remedies, including essential oils, to their routine. 


### What are the potential risks of using essential oils for teething?

Skin irritation and sensitivities can occur, particularly with citrus oils like lemon or orange. These should be avoided as they can cause burning sensations on the delicate gum tissue of infants. 

More serious risks include respiratory issues if inhaled in large quantities or accidental ingestion. Keep all essential oils securely out of reach of children and pets.

Use essential oils for teething relief as needed, typically 3-4 times daily. If symptoms persist or worsen, contact your pediatrician. 

Discontinue use if your child experiences any adverse reactions, including increased crying, rash, or difficulty breathing. 


### What should I look for when purchasing essential oils for infants?

Choose organic, pure essential oils from reputable sources. Look for products that specify they are safe for infants and children. 

Avoid oils that contain carrier oils or additives unless specifically recommended for use in infants. Always check the label and be prepared to dilute as recommended.
