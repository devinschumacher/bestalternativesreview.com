## Buyer's Guide

Choosing the right clipper guard is essential for getting the desired hair length and style. Wahl clipper guards are popular among barbers and stylists for their durability and precision. Here's what to consider when selecting a Wahl clipper guard. 


### Blade Strength and Durability

Wahl guards feature replaceable blades made from high-quality stainless steel. The material and construction determine how well the guard maintains its shape and accuracy over time. Look for guards with hardened blades that resist bending and wear.

### Guard Precision and Compatibility

The precision of a Wahl guard depends on its tolerance - the gap between the guard comb and the blade. Some guards offer multiple tolerance options for fine-tuning results. All Wahl guards are compatible with their company's clippers, so check if you need a specific model for your equipment. 


### Handle Design and Comfort

The guard's handle affects ease of use and control. Look for a design that fits comfortably in your hand with a secure grip. The positioning of the guard teeth should allow for smooth, consistent application when cutting hair.

### Cleaning and Maintenance

Proper care extends the lifespan of your Wahl guard. The guard teeth should be easily accessible for cleaning to remove hair and debris. Check if the guard is dishwasher safe or if special cleaning tools are needed to maintain its performance. 


## FAQ

![Wahl-Clipper-Guards-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Wahl-Clipper-Guards-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a Wahl clipper guard?

A Wahl clipper guard is a plastic attachment designed to be placed over a Wahl clipper's blade to control the length of hair being cut. These guards come in various sizes, allowing for precise hair trimming to specific lengths. 

When installed, the guard restricts the clipper's blade movement, ensuring consistent haircut lengths while reducing the risk of cutting too short or unevenly. 


### Can I use multiple guards at once?

Yes, you can use multiple Wahl clipper guards together to create lengths that fall between the standard guard sizes. For example, using a #10 and #30 guard simultaneously would create a length of approximately 1/4 inch. 

However, it's important to note that this technique requires careful measurement and adjustment to achieve consistent results, as adding too many guards can affect blade efficiency. 

![Wahl-Clipper-Guards-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Wahl-Clipper-Guards-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Which Wahl guards are compatible with my clipper?

Most Wahl clipper models use standardized guard sizes, making it easy to find compatible guards. Common sizes include #000 (1/64 inch), #10 (1/32 inch), #15 (1/16 inch), #20 (3/32 inch), #30 (1/8 inch), #40 (3/16 inch), #50 (1/4 inch), and #60 (5/16 inch). 

Always check your clipper model and user manual to ensure compatibility, as newer models may have specific guard configurations. 


### How do I measure the guard size?

The most accurate way to measure a Wahl clipper guard is by using a digital caliper or gauge specifically made for measuring hair clipper guards. Position the guard on the flat surface of the caliper or gauge to get an exact measurement. 

As an alternative, you can use the following approximate measurements for common guards: #000 = 1.56 mm, #10 = 1.90 mm, #15 = 2.38 mm, #20 = 2.81 mm, #30 = 3.50 mm, #40 = 4.50 mm, #50 = 5.60 mm, #60 = 6.40 mm. 

![Wahl-Clipper-Guards-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Wahl-Clipper-Guards-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How long do Wahl clipper guards typically last?

Wahl clipper guards are durable and can last for several years with regular use and proper care. Each use will gradually wear down the guard, especially at the edges where it contacts the skin or hair. 

To extend the life of your guards, store them properly when not in use and avoid exposing them to extreme temperatures or harsh chemicals. Regularly inspect each guard for signs of wear and replace any that show significant damage or measurement changes. 


### Can I adjust the length of a Wahl guard?

No, the length of a Wahl clipper guard is set at the factory and cannot be adjusted. While you can stack or combine different size guards to create intermediate lengths, you cannot modify the length of a single guard. 

If you need a specific length that isn't available in standard guard sizes, consider purchasing a guard that's slightly shorter than your target length and measuring the resulting haircut to fine-tune your technique.
