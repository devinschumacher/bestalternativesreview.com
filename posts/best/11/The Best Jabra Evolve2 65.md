## Buyer's Guide

The Jabra Evolve2 65 has established itself as a compelling option in its category, offering balanced audio performance and reliable connectivity. When evaluating this model or similar professional headsets, several key factors come into play. 


### Audio Quality and Listening Experience

Audio performance remains paramount, particularly for models like the Jabra Evolve2 65. Consider features such as active noise cancellation (ANC), which helps in maintaining clear audio intake and reducing background noise. The quality of the microphone is equally important for consistent voice transmission, with options for either ambient sound pickup or single-source focus. 


### Comfort and Design

Extended use requires headsets that blend comfort with functionality. Materials and padding affect long-term wearability, while design elements like headband flexibility and earcup positioning contribute to overall comfort. The Jabra Evolve2 65, for instance, features memory-foam ear cushions and a headband that can be adjusted for different head sizes. 


### Connectivity Options

Modern professional headsets increasingly support multiple connection protocols like Bluetooth and USB-C, offering flexibility between different devices. The quality of connection, including latency and stability during calls, should be evaluated. For the Jabra Evolve2 65, both Bluetooth 5.0 and USB charging are standard, though direct USB connection enhances stability for computer use. 


### Additional Features and Accessories

Practical extras like built-in controls for call answering and music playback, as well as carrying pouches and additional ear cushions, can significantly impact long-term value. Consider whether the included accessories meet your specific needs, whether you require a larger volume of spare parts, or if you'd prefer to select them separately based on your usage patterns.
