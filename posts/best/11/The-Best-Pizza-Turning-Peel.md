## Buyer's Guide

A pizza turning peel is an essential tool for professional and home pizzerias, designed to transfer pizza dough directly from a working surface to a baking stone or deck oven. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the right peel for your needs. 


### Key Features of Pizza Turning Peels

High-quality pizza turning peels feature a solid hardwood or fiberglass construction with a heat-resistant surface. The blade should be at least 14 inches long and 12 inches wide to accommodate standard pizza sizes while allowing enough maneuvering room. The peel's bottom surface typically has a textured coating to prevent pizza from slipping during transfer. 


### Heat Resistance and Temperature Rating

The peel's material should have a temperature rating well above the highest oven temperature you'll use. For commercial operations, look for peels rated for at least 600°F (315°C). Home users should choose peels rated for 650°F (343°C) or higher to ensure longevity in a properly preheated home oven. 


### Storage and Cleaning Considerations

Storage space is a critical factor, especially for home users. Consider the peel's dimensions when placed in storage, as most need vertical storage space equal to their length plus a few inches for clearance. Proper cleaning after each use prevents dough residue buildup, and many commercial-grade peels include dishwasher-safe options for easy maintenance. 


### Pairing with Pizza Stones and Ovens

The peel's blade shape should match the style of your baking stone or baking deck, with straight-edged blades working best for preheated stone systems and L-shaped blades ideal for raised baking decks. Ensure the peel's length and blade width suit your oven size, allowing clear movement in both directions across the baking surface. 


## FAQ


### What is a pizza turning peel?

A pizza turning peel is a baking tool with a rigid, usually stainless steel or aluminum, blade attached to a wooden or plastic handle. Its primary function is to safely transfer pizza crusts between the oven and a pizza stone or baking steel, making it essential for professional and home pizza makers who bake with direct heat. 

The peel's design allows bakers to easily pivot and rotate the pizza in the oven, achieving even baking and a proper "oven-snap" texture. Most quality peels measure approximately 24 inches long, though larger options exist for commercial use. 


### How do I properly use a pizza turning peel?

To transfer a pizza, spread a thin layer of cornmeal on your baking stone or steel to prevent sticking. Place the peel's blade under the pizza in a single, smooth motion, ensuring the crust is fully resting on the peel's blade. In the oven, use the peel's handle to pivot the pizza 90 degrees, creating a space for the hot air to circulate underneath, which helps develop the characteristic crispy bottom crust. 

When removing the pizza from the oven, lift the handle to slide the peel out, allowing the pizza to fall directly onto a cutting board. This technique, known as "feathering" the peel, prevents the crust from becoming soggy. 


### What materials are pizza turning peels made of?

The most common material for pizza turning peel blades is stainless steel or aluminum, offering durability and resistance to heat up to 450°F (232°C). Wooden handles are standard, though some premium versions feature maple or walnut for increased durability and aesthetic appeal. Cheaper options may use composite materials like fibreglass for the handle. 

Handle lengths typically range from 24 to 36 inches, with the blade measuring between 18 and 24 inches. Some specialized peels incorporate dual blades for flipping or have ergonomic handle designs for better grip and control. 


### How long do pizza turning peels last?

A well-maintained pizza turning peel can last between 5-10 years with regular use, depending on the material quality and care. Stainless steel blades maintain their shape and integrity for the longest period, while aluminum can warp over time with frequent use. 

Regular maintenance includes wiping down the blade after each use, storing in a dry location, and performing quarterly inspections to check for any wear or damage. Proper care can extend the peel's lifespan significantly and maintain its performance. 


### What is the difference between a pizza peel and a standard baking peel?

A pizza peel is specifically designed for pizza baking, featuring a shorter blade and a slightly larger overall size to accommodate the unique requirements of pizza-making. The blade on a pizza peel is typically 18-24 inches long, compared to 12-18 inches on standard baking peels. 

Standard baking peels are more versatile and feature longer blades for handling other baking items. They're commonly used in bread-making and cake transfers, with some featuring specialized features like wire racks for cooling sheets. 


### Can I use a pizza turning peel for other baking tasks?

For most baking tasks, including pizza, a standard baking peel or broom-style peel is more versatile due to their longer blade design. However, a dedicated pizza peel's shorter blade makes it more maneuverable in the small space between the oven and baking stone, where tight turns are necessary. 

The primary function of a pizza turning peel is transfer and flipping, making it less suitable for tasks requiring prolonged support, such as scoring bread or handling heavy items like full-sized cakes. It's ideal for pizza-making but may not be the best choice for all baking needs.
