## Buyer's Guide

A back of couch table adds functionality and storage to your living space, making it a practical addition to your furniture collection. These versatile pieces can enhance both the aesthetics and organization of your room. When selecting a back of couch table, consider its size, style, storage options, and material quality to find the perfect piece for your space. 


### Size and Proportion

Measure the space behind your couch to determine the ideal table dimensions. Standard back of couch tables range from 18 to 24 inches deep, matching the typical depth of couches. The table's height should complement your couch, usually falling between 24 and 28 inches above the floor. Consider adding 2 to 3 inches of extra space for easier access. 


### Storage Options

Many back of couch tables feature built-in storage, such as drawers or shelves. Evaluate the storage capacity based on your needs, from casual items like magazines and remote controls to essential items like blankets and games. Consider the material and construction quality of storage components to ensure longevity and functionality. 


### Style and Design

Back of couch tables come in various styles, from sleek modern designs to traditional wooden pieces. Choose a style that matches your existing furniture and interior decor. Consider factors like the table's finish, legs, and overall silhouette to find a piece that enhances your room's aesthetics. 


### Material Quality

The durability of your back of couch table depends on its material quality. Hardwood tables offer lasting value and a classic look, while engineered wood provides cost-effective alternatives. Consider the finish type, such as painted or lacquered options, and the table's construction details, like reinforced legs and drawer supports, to ensure long-term functionality. 


## FAQ


### What are the main features to consider when choosing a back of couch table?

A back of couch table should complement your existing furniture while providing practical storage and display space. Key features include size compatibility with your couch, material durability, and storage options such as shelves, drawers, or open compartments. 

Consider the table's weight capacity, especially if you plan to store heavier items like books or decorative pieces. The height should align with your couch's armrests for easy access, and the design should match your room's decor style. 


### How do you measure for a back of couch table?

Measure the depth of your couch at the back, then add about 2-3 inches for clearance and stability. Most standard back of couch tables range from 12-18 inches deep, so this measurement will guide your selection. 

Measure the height of the couch's armrests and add 2-4 inches for the table's legs. This will ensure the table sits comfortably at waist level, making it practical for both display and storage purposes. 


### What materials are commonly used for back of couch tables?

Metal tables offer durability with sleek designs, often featuring powder-coated finishes for resistance to scratches and corrosion. Wooden tables, particularly those made from oak, cherry, or walnut, provide warmth and timeless appeal with natural grain patterns. 

Some modern options incorporate MDF or particle board with reinforced legs for additional stability. These materials can be more affordable while maintaining good structural integrity. 


### How much storage capacity should I expect from a back of couch table?

Standard back of couch tables offer 1-2 open compartments or shelves, providing enough space for a few decorative items or small pieces of storage furniture like baskets or containers. 

For more substantial storage needs, look for tables with built-in drawers or multiple shelf levels. These configurations can provide up to 8 cubic feet of storage, allowing you to keep blankets, pillows, or seasonal decorations organized. 


### What maintenance requirements should I consider?

Most back of couch tables require minimal maintenance. Wipe down metal surfaces with a mild soap solution and water regularly. For wooden tables, use a furniture polisher or wood-specific cleaner to maintain the finish and protect against scratches. 

Check for loose screws or wobbly legs periodically and tighten as needed. Regularly inspect the base and legs for signs of wear and replace any missing hardware promptly to maintain stability. 


### Are there any safety considerations?

Tables with sharp corners or thin legs present a tripping hazard. Opt for tables with rounded edges and robust legs that extend at least 5 inches below the shelf to prevent tipping. 

Ensure the table's weight distribution is even to prevent tipping, especially if it contains stored items. For added security, consider selecting a table with a weighted bottom or a castor wheel system to enhance stability.
