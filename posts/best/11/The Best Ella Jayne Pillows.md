### Materials and Construction

The pillow's core material significantly affects its support and durability. Common materials include memory foam, down, down alternative, and feather. Memory foam provides consistent support and conforms to your shape, while down and down alternative offer plush comfort. Feather pillows are lighter but require more frequent fluffing to maintain shape. 


### Support and Pressure Relief

Support is crucial for preventing neck strain and maintaining proper spinal alignment. Memory foam and orthopedic pillows provide the best support, conforming to your neck's shape while keeping it straight. For pressure relief, consider pillows with adjustable firmness or those that distribute weight evenly across the shoulder and neck. 


### Size and Firmness

Standard pillow sizes range from 20 inches to 27 inches in length and 6 inches to 9 inches in height. Cervical pillows, designed specifically for side sleepers, typically measure 12 inches to 14 inches high. Firmness options vary based on material, with memory foam and latex offering the most customizable options through different density levels. 


### Care and Maintenance

Proper care extends a pillow's lifespan and maintains itsperformance. Most pillows should be washed every three to six months using a pillow protector. Memory foam and down pillows benefit from regular vacuuming. Feather and down alternative pillows can be hand washed or placed in a mesh bag for machine washing. All pillows need regular airing outside to maintain freshness and prevent dust mites.
