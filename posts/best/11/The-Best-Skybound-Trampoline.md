## Buyer's Guide

A skybound trampoline provides an exhilarating way to bounce and flip, but choosing the right one requires considering several key factors. This guide outlines essential features and practical advice to help you select a safe and durable trampoline that matches your needs and space. 


### Space and Location

Measure your available area before purchasing. Standard backyard trampolines require at least a 30-foot diameter clearance. Consider factors like weather exposure, proximity to structures, and safety netting needs. The location should allow for proper landing zones and minimize impact on surrounding surfaces. 

![Skybound-Trampoline-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Skybound-Trampoline-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Frame and Construction

Trampoline frames come in aluminum, steel, or powder-coated steel. Steel frames offer the most durability but are heavier. Look for designs with square corners rather than rounded ones to reduce edge risks. The frame diameter and leg support length affect bounce quality and stability. 


### Spring and Mat Quality

Check the spring diameter and count for consistent bounce. Higher-quality springs are thicker and made from specialized materials. The mat should be made from UV-resistant, puncture-resistant material with a protective foam layer. The mat's edge design impacts safety - rolled edges offer better protection than flat ones. 

![Skybound-Trampoline-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Skybound-Trampoline-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Safety Features

Standard safety features include enclosed netting, padding around the frame, and protective base pads. Consider a trampoline with a cover that prevents access when not in use. The launch pad design affects safety - some models provide better controlled landings than others. 


## FAQ
