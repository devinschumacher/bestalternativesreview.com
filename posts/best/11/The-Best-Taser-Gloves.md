## FAQ

![Taser-Gloves-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Taser-Gloves-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are taser gloves and how do they work?

Taser gloves are self-defense weapons that deliver an electric shock through prongs or probes when the wearer touches an attacker. They combine concealed carry with protection against close-quarters attacks. 

The device typically consists of insulated gloves with built-in conductive prongs or probes that extend when pressure is applied. When these contacts touch a target, they deliver a high-voltage pulse that temporarily incapacitates the attacker through muscle paralysis and pain. 


### Who should consider using taser gloves?

Taser gloves are suitable for individuals who need concealed self-defense, such as women carrying purses, security personnel, or anyone working in high-risk environments where traditional weapons aren't practical. 

Users should be physically capable of deploying the device and willing to potentially cause serious pain to an attacker. Legal considerations vary by jurisdiction, so research local laws before purchasing. 

![Taser-Gloves-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Taser-Gloves-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How effective are taser gloves in real-world situations?

Independent testing has shown taser gloves to be effective in neutralizing threats at close range. The device has been used successfully in self-defense situations, though results can vary based on factors like target size and environmental conditions. 

Users report that the pain stimulus typically causes attackers to release their grip and allows time to escape or call for help. However, tasers should not be relied upon as a primary defense mechanism. 


### What are the main benefits of taser gloves compared to other self-defense tools?

Taser gloves offer several advantages: they are discreet and concealable, require no aiming, and deliver pain quickly at point of contact. This makes them useful in situations where traditional weapons might be impractical or prohibited. 

They also provide immediate protection without the risk of permanent injury to the wielder, as the device is designed to deliver a temporary incapacitating shock rather than a lethal one. 

![Taser-Gloves-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Taser-Gloves-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the limitations of taser gloves?

Most taser gloves deliver a single shock lasting 0.5 to 1.5 seconds, which may not be enough to safely subdue a determined attacker. Users should practice proper technique and be prepared to use other defensive tactics. 

Environmental factors can affect performance, with water, conductive materials, and extreme temperatures potentially reducing effectiveness. Regular maintenance and testing are necessary to ensure reliable operation. 


### How do I properly use taser gloves?

To use taser gloves, position the probes against the target's wrist, arm, or shoulder. The prongs will automatically deploy when pressed into skin, delivering the shock. Release pressure once the attacker has dropped or moved away. 

Always maintain awareness of your surroundings and have an escape route planned. Practice proper grip and deployment techniques to maximize effectiveness in a real-world scenario.
