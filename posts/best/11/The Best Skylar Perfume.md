## Buyer's Guide

Skylar perfume blends elegance with natural scents, offering both women's and men's options in various strengths. Understanding the key aspects of Skylar fragrances can help you select the right scent for your personal style and preferences. 


### Top Notes

The opening scents, or top notes, are the first ones you'll experience when wearing a perfume. Skylar fragrances typically start with fresh, zesty accords that dissipate within minutes. These initial scents set the stage for the middle and base notes, influencing how the overall fragrance develops. 

![Skylar-Perfume-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Skylar-Perfume-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Middle Notes

Middle notes, or heart notes, emerge several minutes after application and form the core character of the fragrance. Skylar perfumes often incorporate floral, herbal, or spicy elements in this phase, providing depth and complexity to the scent profile. 


### Base Notes

Base notes anchor the fragrance and are typically the longest-lasting layer. Skylar perfumes might feature rich, woody, or vanilla tones in this section, contributing lasting depth and character to the scent. 

![Skylar-Perfume-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Skylar-Perfume-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Eau de Toilette vs. Eau de Parfum

The concentration of fragrance oil determines how long a scent lasts and how intense it is. Eau de Toilette (EDT) usually has a 10-15% concentration, while Eau de Parfum (EDP) contains 15-20%. For lasting wear, consider EDP, but if you prefer a more subtle presence, an EDT might be appropriate. 


## FAQ

![Skylar-Perfume-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Skylar-Perfume-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What scents are included in the Skylar collection?

Skylar offers a diverse range of scents suitable for all occasions. The collection includes fresh, woody, and slightly spicy notes that develop into a deep musk base. 

Each scent combines top notes of bergamot and cardamom, middle notes of cedarwood and lavender, with a base of patchouli and vanilla. 


### What is the intended wear time for Skylar perfumes?

Skylar perfumes have been designed to last 6-8 hours on the skin, with the distinctive dried-wood and musk notes providing lasting depth to the fragrance. 

The complex scent structure means the perfume projects well for 2-3 hours before settling into a dry-down phase that lasts throughout the day. 

![Skylar-Perfume-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Skylar-Perfume-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How should Skylar perfumes be applied for optimal wear?

Apply a small amount to pulse points like the wrists, neck, and behind the ears for the best results. Lightly spraying the wrists and then pressing them together allows the body heat to mix the notes. 

A minimal application in the morning can be boosted with a light spritz at noon for daytime wear, while evening applications can include additional notes to intensify the scent. 


### Who are the target consumers for Skylar perfumes?

Skylar fragrances are designed for both men and women who appreciate a sophisticated, slightly spicy scent that evolves from fresh to rich over time. 

The brand positions its products for wear throughout the day, suitable for casual morning coffee dates to formal evening events. 

![Skylar-Perfume-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Skylar-Perfume-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Are Skylar perfumes water-resistant?

Skylar perfumes retain their integrity well under most daily activities but are not showerproof or suitable for water sports. The natural ingredients may degrade more quickly in direct water exposure. 

If you plan to wear the perfume for outdoor activities, it's best to apply it after the morning shower and before applying sunscreen or other products. 


### What should I consider when choosing a Skylar fragrance?

Consider factors like your personal fragrance preferences, the occasion you're dressing for, and whether you prefer a more subtle or bold scent statement. 

Lighter formulations work well for daily use and mixed environments like offices or public spaces, while more intense versions suit solo activities or at-home use where the fragrance can develop fully.
