These teeny-tiny glow-in-the-dark stars might light up the room, but they're so small you'll need a major case of sticker addiction to put them all up. The instructions say 100 stickers for complete coverage, but with each star smaller than a finder tip, you're talking serious commitment to finish the job. The blue-and-white design looks cute, if a bit disappointing if you were expecting those big lunar specimens from the catalog photos.

These self-adhesive paper glow-in-the-dark stickers come in two large and four small sheets, plus a bonus Zodiac Star Chart. Each packet features over 1,000 stars, moons, rockets, and spaceships that create a magical night sky when the lights go out – but only if you can actually get them off the matte paper they come on, since peeling them off can be surprisingly challenging. The stars stick well to painted surfaces and can be used to decorate ceilings, walls, school bags, and even bicycles, though some pieces may need trimming to remove black edges.

These glow-in-the-dark plastic stars, which come in a generous 100-piece set, have a nifty trick up their silicone sleeves – they soak up light and light up your room when the electricity goes out. Their intended applications range from wall and ceiling decorations to window dressing and even treehouse enhancements. However, a recent review points out a minor usability issue: despite their photoluminescent qualities, the stickers struggle to adhere properly, making them more challenging to work with than traditional wall decals.

## Buyer's Guide

Glow in the dark stars transform any room into a night sky wonderland, perfect for bedrooms, playrooms, or outdoor camping. These photoluminescent stars light up the dark with minimal energy, creating a magical atmosphere. 


### Adhesive Options

Stars come with various adhesives: double-sided tape, self-adhesive backing, or liquid glue. Double-sided tape works best for smooth surfaces, while self-adhesive backing is convenient for quick application. Liquid glue offers the most flexibility but requires precise positioning.

### Brightness and Lasting Time

Photoluminescent stars store energy from light and release it gradually. Brightness depends on exposure time and intensity. Generally, stars glow brighter after 30 minutes of charging and fade over 3-4 hours. Quality stars maintain their glow longer than lower-cost alternatives. 


### Size and Spacing

Smaller stars (1-2 inches) create a dense night sky effect, while larger ones (3-6 inches) make fewer, more prominent stars. Space stars 6-12 inches apart for natural visibility. Larger rooms may need more stars for optimal coverage.

### Child Safety

Check if stars contain small parts that could be choking hazards. Opt for self-adhesive stars instead of liquid glue for easy removal. Some stars may contain mild chemicals; ensure they're non-toxic and washable for cleaning. 


## FAQ

![Glow-in-the-Dark-Stars-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Glow-in-the-Dark-Stars-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What materials are these stars made from?

The glow in the dark stars are typically made from a combination of zinc sulfide and other luminous compounds. This material is sandwiched between two layers of plastic or resin for durability and protection. 

Some high-quality versions use a more advanced photoluminescent technology that requires less activation time and produces brighter, longer-lasting glow. 


### How long do they stay illuminated after being charged?

The illumination period varies by product, but most glow in the dark stars will remain visible for 4 to 12 hours after being fully charged under standard light sources. 

Some premium versions can provide up to 24 hours of glow time, though they require longer charging times in ideal conditions. 

![Glow-in-the-Dark-Stars-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Glow-in-the-Dark-Stars-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What types of light sources charge them?

These stars can be charged by any normal indoor light source, including incandescent, fluorescent, and LED lights. The stronger and closer the light source, the faster they will charge. 

Sunlight can also charge them, though it's less practical for indoor use. The charging time typically ranges from 30 minutes to several hours, depending on the intensity and duration of exposure. 


### How should they be charged?

Charge the stars in complete darkness to ensure optimal glow properties. Place them in a dark room and expose them to light sources for 30 minutes to 4 hours, depending on the product specifications. 

Avoid direct sunlight or harsh UV light sources as they can degrade the luminous material over time. Instead, use standard indoor lighting for charging.

### How should they be stored when not in use?

Store them in a dark place when not in use to preserve their glow properties. The darkness helps maintain their brightness and ensures consistent performance when activated. 

Avoid exposing them to direct sunlight or extreme temperatures, as this can affect their luminous intensity and longevity. 


### Are they safe for children?

These stars are generally safe for children, but proper supervision is recommended, especially for young children who might ingest small parts. 

Ensure that they are stored out of reach of children when not in use and thoroughly wash hands after handling them.
