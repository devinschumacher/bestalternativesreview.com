## Buyer's Guide

The Nike GTS series represents a specific iteration of the company's popular running shoe lineup, combining lightweight construction with moisture-wicking capabilities. Understanding the key aspects of these shoes can help runners choose the right pair for their needs. 


### Performance Features

These running shoes typically incorporate Nike's Gradial Flywire technology, which provides a secure fit while maintaining flexibility. The Flymesh upper enhances ventilation, keeping feet cool during workouts. Modern iterations may feature additional supportive elements like heel counters and medial posts for stability during running. 


### Performance Metrics

When evaluating Nike GTS shoes, consider the specific metric profile. Many versions offer a neutral fit, suitable for everyday runners, while others provide more pronounced heel-to-toe offset for those transitioning to minimalist footwear. The cushioning system, usually combining foam midsoles with responsive Fly Foam technology, determines the shoe's ride quality. 


### Usage Considerations

Trail runners in the GTS series excel at handling varied terrain, incorporating robust rubber outsoles with ample traction. Road versions prioritize lightweight construction and responsiveness. The ideal GTS shoe balances your preferred level of support with personal comfort, making it essential to try on multiple sizes and styles before selecting a pair. 


### Fit and Sizing

Proper fit is crucial for performance and durability. Most Nike GTS models run true to size, but some versions may feel slightly snug. It's advisable to try on shoes later in the day when feet are at their largest, as standard running shoes allow minimal room for movement. 


## FAQ


### What makes Nike Gts different from other running shoes?

Designed for everyday runners, the Nike Gts combine lightweight construction with superior cushioning. These shoes prioritize comfort and durability with features like a breathable mesh upper and reinforced heel support. 

The Gts offer a generous fit compared to some minimalistic runners, making them suitable for both casual and serious runners who value stability and cushioning. 


### How do Nike Gts compare to their predecessor models?

Nike regularly updates their Gt models to incorporate new technologies and design improvements. Recent iterations have focused on enhanced moisture management and a more secure fit through updated lacing systems and tighter heel retention. 

While the core design remains familiar, each new model represents incremental advancements in comfort and performance based on feedback from runners worldwide. 


### Can these shoes handle long-distance running?

Designed for distances up to 20 miles, the Nike Gts excel in longer runs due to their strategic foam placement under the foot. The cushioning system helps absorb impact during extended wear without compromising on energy return. 

Many runners successfully complete marathons wearing the Gts, though some may prefer additional support options for ultra-long distances. 


### What are the key technical features of Nike Gts?

The shoes feature a Flymesh construction for ventilation, with strategic foam inserts under the ball and heel of the foot. The lace system includes elasticized loops to enhance lockdown and prevent bunching during runs. 

Additional details include a rubber toe cap for durability and a woven tongue that reduces friction against the skin. Each element has been optimized to improve comfort and performance during regular running. 


### How do Nike Gts perform in wet or muddy conditions?

The mesh upper remains breathable even in damp conditions, while water-resistant finishes help prevent excessive moisture absorption. The rubber outsole provides adequate traction on wet surfaces, though specific models may vary in their water resistance. 

For running in muddy or slushy conditions, additional protection like booties or specific mud guards might be recommended to maintain optimal performance and prevent excessive wear. 


### What size should I choose when purchasing Nike Gts?

The Gts run slightly wide compared to some Nike models, with most runners finding their usual size fits well. However, those with a narrower foot may want to consider a half size down. 

It's recommended to try on a pair before purchasing, as slight variations in manufacturing can affect fit. Proper sizing ensures the best performance and comfort during your runs.
