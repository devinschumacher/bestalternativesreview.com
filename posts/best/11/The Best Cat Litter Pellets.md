## Buyer's Guide

Cat litter pellets offer improved cleanliness and odor control compared to traditional clumping litters. Understanding their benefits and characteristics will help you choose the right product for your cat's needs. 


### Pellet Size and Shape

Select pellets that are small enough for your cat to eliminate waste comfortably, typically ranging from 1/8 to 1/4 inch diameter. Teardrop-shaped pellets help contain waste while allowing easy removal during cleaning. 


### Dust Content

Opt for low-dust pellets that reduce respiratory irritation. Formulated with natural clay or wheat, these tend to be less dusty than traditional silica-based clumping litters. 


### Bulk Density and Absorbency

Higher bulk density allows using less litter while maintaining odor control. Choose pellets that clump well when wet, helping contain waste and making cleanup easier. 


### Odor Control Features

Some premium pellets incorporate baking soda or charcoal for enhanced odor neutralization. These features help maintain a fresh litter box environment without strong chemical scents. 


## FAQ


### What are cat litter pellets?

Cat litter pellets, also known as crystal litter or clay pellets, are made from bentonite clay and processed into small, round beads. These pellets absorb liquids and retain waste, creating clumps that are easy to scoop out. 

The pellets are highly absorbent, capable of holding many times their weight in liquid. This characteristic helps prevent litter box odors by absorbing ammonia and other volatile compounds produced by decomposing waste. 


### Are cat litter pellets safe for cats?

Cat litter pellets are generally considered safe for cats when used as directed. The bentonite clay used in these products is non-toxic and designed to prevent ingestion, with the spherical shape reducing the risk of digestive obstruction compared to clumping clay litter. 

However, cats rarely consume cat litter. Signs of ingestion include vomiting, lethargy, or loss of appetite. If you notice these symptoms, consult your veterinarian, as any type of cat litter can potentially cause digestive issues. 


### How do cat litter pellets compare to other types of cat litter?

Compared to clay clumping litters, cat litter pellets have a thinner profile and are less likely to dust, making them more appealing to cats that dislike litter tracking. They also generally have better odor control due to their larger size and superior absorption properties. 

pellets are more expensive than silica gel litter but less than many organic alternatives like wood or corn litter. They offer similar performance to clumping clay litter while being more dust-free and effective at preventing tracked litter. 


### How much cat litter pellet do I need?

For new litter boxes, start with a 2-inch layer of pellets. For existing boxes, replace about 25% of the litter each week, scraping out any clumps or solids. When topping off, add 1-2 inches of fresh pellets to maintain cleanliness and absorption capacity. 

Use approximately 1 pound of pellets per square foot of litter box surface area. This volume is enough for weekly refills in an average 12-inch deep litter box. 


### How should I transition my cat to pellets?

To transition your cat to pellets, slowly mix the new litter with your current litter over several days. Start with a 1:3 ratio of current litter to pellets, gradually increasing the pellet portion each day until your cat is fully using the new litter. 

Water the pellets lightly before adding them to the litter box to help retain moisture and prevent dust. This step also helps activate the natural silica gel component that enhances odor control and absorption. 


### Can I use cat litter pellets with a clumping litter scoop?

Cat litter pellets work well with standard clumping litter scoops. The pellets form clumps when moistened, making them easy to remove from the litter box. Since pellets are smoother than traditional clumping litter, they may slide through the scoop faster, requiring more frequent scooping. 

For optimal results, use a scoop with a smaller hole size than what you might use with clumping clay litter. This helps prevent clumping pellets from falling through the openings, ensuring thorough removal of waste and moisture-rich clumps.
