## Buyer's Guide

The Taylormade RBZ Speedlite golf club features several noteworthy design elements and technical advancements. Understanding these aspects will help you make an informed decision that matches your playing style and goals. 


### Hybrid Design

At the core of the RBZ Speedlite is its hybrid clubhead design, combining elements from woods and irons. This unique construction typically results in a fairway wood-like distance gain compared to traditional hybrids while maintaining iron-like accuracy and control. 


### Forging Process

The club undergoes a precise forging process that impacts both performance and feel. Forging involves shaping the material around a mold rather than stamping it out, leading to a more uniform grain structure and potentially better feedback from the face. 


### Shaft Options

Expect a range of shaft options compatible with the RBZ Speedlite. The right shaft can significantly affect your ball flight and feel, making compatibility an important consideration. Lighter, more flexible shafts might be suitable for higher-handicappers seeking extra ball speed, while stiffer shafts may benefit lower-handicappers prioritizing control. 


### Tour Features Adaptation

The RBZ Speedlite builds upon Tour-revived designs while making adjustments for the average golfer. This includes considerations for launch conditions, spin rates, and overall ball flight characteristics that differ from professional play.

The RBZ Speedlite uses standard hot shoe mount compatibility, meaning it works with cameras from multiple manufacturers including Canon, Nikon, Sony, and others that support hot shoe flashes.
