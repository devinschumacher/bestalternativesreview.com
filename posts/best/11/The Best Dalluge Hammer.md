## FAQ

![Dalluge-Hammer-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Dalluge-Hammer-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a Dalluge Hammer?

A Dalluge Hammer combines elements of a sledgehammer and a maul, featuring a large, heavy head made from durable materials like steel or cast iron with a hardwood handle. It's designed for powerful striking applications, particularly in demolition or construction work. 

The term "Dalluge" is a registered trademark, and while similar tools may exist, the specific design and features of a Dalluge Hammer are protected intellectual property. 


### How Much Does a Dalluge Hammer Weigh?

The standard Dalluge Hammer weighs approximately 12 pounds, making it relatively manageable for regular use while still providing substantial striking power. Heavier models can reach up to 18 pounds. 

These weight variations allow users to choose between lighter tools for everyday use and heavier ones for more demanding tasks, though the standard 12-pound model is versatile enough for most applications. 

![Dalluge-Hammer-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Dalluge-Hammer-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What Materials are Dalluge Hammers Made From?

The head of a Dalluge Hammer is typically constructed from forged steel or cast iron, providing durability and consistent performance under heavy use. The handle is traditionally made from hardwood, often maple or hickory, to resist splitting and provide a secure grip. 

Some higher-end models incorporate shock-absorbing materials or reinforced handles to reduce vibrations and increase user comfort during prolonged use. 


### How Should You Maintain a Dalluge Hammer?

To keep your Dalluge Hammer in optimal condition, regularly inspect the head and handle for signs of wear or damage. The head should maintain its original shape and weight distribution, while the handle should remain firmly attached and free from cracks. 

After each use, clean both the head and handle with a mild soap solution, dry thoroughly, and apply a light coating of oil to the handle to prevent drying and cracking. Store in a dry location when not in use.

### What Safety Precautions Should You Take?

Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment when using a Dalluge Hammer, including safety glasses, gloves, and steel-toed boots to protect against impact and flying debris. 

Ensure the work area is clear of obstacles and debris before use, maintain control of the hammer during strikes, and never swing it overhead like a conventional sledgehammer. Instead, use a smooth, balanced swing to transfer your body's weight into each strike. 


### How Much Do Dalluge Hammers Cost?

Entry-level Dalluge Hammers typically range from $30 to $50, offering basic functionality for casual or occasional use. Higher-quality models with premium materials and features can cost between $60 and $150, providing enhanced durability and performance.
