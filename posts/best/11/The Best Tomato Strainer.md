## Buyer's Guide

A tomato strainer is an essential tool for anyone who wants to make homemade tomato sauce or puree. These kitchen gadgets are designed to separate cooked tomatoes from their skins, seeds, and pulp, making it easier to create smooth and flavorful tomato-based dishes. 


### Size and Capacity

When selecting a tomato strainer, consider the quantity of tomatoes you typically process. Standard strainers handle about 4-6 cups of chopped tomatoes. If you frequently make large batches of sauce, look for a strainer with a larger capacity or multiple strainer attachments. 


### Metal vs. Plastic

Metal strainers last longer and can be used for more aggressive blending than plastic ones. However, they're more expensive and heavier. Plastic strainers are lighter and dishwasher-safe but may wear out faster and eventually need replacement. Choose based on your usage frequency and preference for durability versus convenience. 


### Sieve Mesh Size

The sieve mesh size determines how fine your tomato puree will be. Coarse mesh catches larger pieces, while fine mesh produces a smoother consistency. For most home cooking needs, a medium mesh (20-30 holes per inch) strike a good balance between yield and texture. 


### Cleaning and Maintenance

Proper maintenance ensures your tomato strainer lasts longer and functions efficiently. Most metal strainers require hand washing with a stiff brush to remove stubborn tomato residue. Plastic models can usually go in the dishwasher. Store your strainer in a dry place to prevent rust or cracking. 


## FAQ


### What is the primary function of a tomato strainer?

A tomato strainer separates puree from seeds and skins, ideal for making smooth sauces and soups. The strainer uses fine mesh to retain solids while allowing liquids to pass through. 

This kitchen tool helps remove excess liquids from cooked tomatoes, creating a thicker consistency. It's particularly useful for making concentrated tomato sauces and purees. 


### How does a tomato strainer differ from other kitchen strainers?

Standard kitchen strainers have larger mesh sizes, typically 1/4 inch or larger, which allows them to catch larger pieces like pasta and vegetables. Tomato strainers have much finer mesh - often 100 or 200 microns - specifically for tomato processing. 

Other specialized strainers, like juice extractors, have different designs optimized for citrus or herb extraction. A tomato strainer combines fine mesh with a large capacity basket for efficient processing. 


### Can I use any strainer for making tomato sauce?

A standard kitchen strainer can be used as a last resort, but the results may not be ideal. Regular mesh sizes allow some seeds and pulp to pass through, affecting the sauce's texture. 

For better results, consider using a tomato strainer or a combination of a food mill and fine-mesh strainer. These tools help achieve a smoother, seed-free texture in your tomato sauce. 


### What materials are tomato strainers made from?

Most tomato strainers are made from stainless steel, offering durability and easy cleaning. Some models feature plastic or silicone mesh for lighter-duty tasks. 

Heavier-duty industrial strainers may use metal or special food-grade plastic materials that can handle the weight of wet ingredients. 


### How do I properly maintain a tomato strainer?

Hand wash the strainer after each use with mild soap and warm water. Rinse thoroughly to remove all food residue. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners that can damage the mesh. 

Regular maintenance includes checking for any signs of wear or tear in the mesh. Replace the strainer if you notice significant damage, as this can affect the quality of your tomato products. 


### What are the advantages of using a tomato strainer?

A tomato strainer speeds up the process of making sauces and soups by quickly separating solids from liquids. This efficiency helps maintain peak flavor and texture in your homemade tomato dishes. 

Unlike blending, which can introduce air and alter the sauce's consistency, a tomato strainer retains the natural texture of the tomatoes while removing excess liquid. This results in a more authentic, homemade quality to your sauce.
