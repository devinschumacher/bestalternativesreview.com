These kettles feature a wide base that ensures even heating and stability during boiling. The measuring gradations on the side help you control the exact amount of water. Safety features include automatic shut-off when the kettle reaches boiling point and a carry handle that stays cool during use. 


### Capacity and Frequency of Use

Capacity ranges from 1.5 to 2 liters, suitable for both single servings and shared tea experiences. Consider how frequently you'll use the kettle - daily tea drinkers may prefer a larger 2-liter model, while occasional users might opt for the smaller size. 


### Maintenance and Cleaning

After each use, allow the kettle to cool completely before cleaning with warm, soapy water. The cast-iron exterior can be wiped down with a damp cloth and mild soap. Avoid abrasive cleaners that might damage the coating or remove the protective layer.
