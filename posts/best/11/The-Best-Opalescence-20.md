## FAQ


### What is Opalescence 20?

Opalescence 20 is a professional teeth whitening system that combines the effectiveness of at-home trays with the convenience of over-the-counter products. The system uses a unique hydrogen peroxide formula that safely lightens teeth by breaking down stain particles. 

Each Opalescence 20 kit includes custom-fitted trays and a series of whitening compounds, allowing users to achieve their desired results at their own pace. The system is effective for mild to moderate stains and is suitable for most adult teeth. 


### What are the key benefits of Opalescence 20?

Opalescence 20 offers several advantages over traditional whitening products. Custom-fitted trays ensure the solution stays in contact with your teeth, maximizing bleaching effectiveness while minimizing irritation. The professional-grade formula provides faster results than over-the-counter products while remaining safe for daily use. 

Unlike some professional treatments that require multiple visits, Opalescence 20 allows you to whiten your teeth at home, making it a convenient option for maintaining your smile between dental visits. 


### Who is suitable for Opalescence 20?

Opalescence 20 is generally safe for most adults, including non-smokers and those with mild tooth sensitivity. It's particularly effective for individuals with mild to moderate stains from coffee, tea, or cigarette smoking. People with severe tooth sensitivity, gum recession, or certain medical conditions should consult their dentist before use. 

Teenagers under 16 and pregnant or nursing women should avoid the product due to the potential risks associated with hydrogen peroxide use in these populations. 


### How long does Opalescence 20 take to work?

Results from Opalescence 20 typically become noticeable after 3-4 days of use, with most users achieving their desired shade within 7-10 days. The exact timeline depends on your starting shade, the intensity of the product used, and your adherence to the application instructions. 

For optimal results, follow the recommended treatment plan of wearing the trays daily for 30 minutes or as directed by your dentist. Results may vary, and some users may need to extend their treatment period to achieve their ideal shade. 


### What are the potential side effects?

Opalescence 20 is generally well-tolerated, but some users may experience temporary side effects during treatment. The most common side effect is tooth sensitivity, which usually subsides within 24-48 hours after treatment ends. Other minor side effects include gum irritation, minor tooth discomfort, and temporary whitening of the soft tissues. 

Severe side effects are rare but possible. If you experience persistent pain, excessive sensitivity, or irritation that doesn't improve within a few days, discontinue use and consult your dentist. 


### How much does Opalescence 20 cost?

The cost of Opalescence 20 varies by retailer and product type. The professional-grade products typically range from $50 to $100 per kit, while over-the-counter versions are generally less expensive, starting at around $20-30 per kit. Some dental practices offer in-office whitening services for around $500-700, making the at-home Opalescence 20 kits a more economical option for gradual whitening. 

Price may also vary based on the specific shade strength of the product you purchase. Professional-grade kits often include multiple strength levels, allowing you to adjust the intensity of the whitening process as needed.
