### Frame Fit and Adjustability

Find bodega glasses that offer adjustable nose pads and temple tips for a customized fit, which helps prevent slippage during daily wear. The frame should sit comfortably on your nose and wrap around your ears without causing pressure points, ensuring all-day wearability. 


### Lens Options

Standard bodega glasses come in various tints for UV protection, with polarized lenses available for reducing glare in sunny conditions. For prescriptions, select glasses with genuine optical glass or high-index resin lenses that maintain visual clarity while remaining lightweight.

To keep your bodega glasses looking their best, use a soft microfiber cloth for daily cleaning and storage in a hard case when not in use. Regular cleaning with mild soap and water helps remove buildup, but avoid harsh chemicals that can damage the frame's finish.
