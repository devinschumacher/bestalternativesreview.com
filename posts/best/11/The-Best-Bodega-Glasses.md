### Frame Fit and Adjustability

Find bodega glasses that offer adjustable nose pads and temple tips for a customized fit, which helps prevent slippage during daily wear. The frame should sit comfortably on your nose and wrap around your ears without causing pressure points, ensuring all-day wearability. 


### Lens Options

Standard bodega glasses come in various tints for UV protection, with polarized lenses available for reducing glare in sunny conditions. For prescriptions, select glasses with genuine optical glass or high-index resin lenses that maintain visual clarity while remaining lightweight.

To keep your bodega glasses looking their best, use a soft microfiber cloth for daily cleaning and storage in a hard case when not in use. Regular cleaning with mild soap and water helps remove buildup, but avoid harsh chemicals that can damage the frame's finish.

The glasses incorporate anti-reflective coatings and UV protection across all styles, ensuring clear vision while safeguarding eyes from harmful rays. Many frames also include hidden spring hinges for durability and better lens alignment. 


### How do I choose the right Bodega glasses style?

Consider your face shape and lifestyle when selecting a Bodega style. Round frames suit square or diamond-shaped faces, while rectangular frames complement oval or heart-shaped faces. For active lifestyles, Bodega's sporty styles with temple tips may offer better stability. 

Frame sizes range from 42-54mm in width, so measuring your current glasses or face width can help find the ideal fit. The brand's online sizing chart can also assist in determining your best size.

### How should I care for my Bodega glasses?

Regular cleaning with a microfiber cloth and mild soap helps maintain frame integrity and lens clarity. Store frames upright in a protective case when not in use to prevent scratches and misshaping. 

Avoid harsh chemicals, abrasive materials, or excessive force when cleaning, as these can damage the frame or lenses. Regular adjustments to nose pads and temple tips can maintain proper fit and prevent unnecessary wear on the frame.
