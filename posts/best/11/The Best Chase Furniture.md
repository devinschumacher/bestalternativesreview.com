### [Noble House Ashtabula Chaise Lounge](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Chase+Furniture?utm\_term=noble-house-ashtabula-chaise-lounge)

This chaise lounge arrived with some serious assembly required, and the birch wood frame turned out to be anything but stable – the legs moved so much I had to keep tightening the screws just to sit down. The navy blue fabric pilled like crazy and started attracting hair and dirt within days of getting it home. All that for a bench that's so uncomfortable it actually hurts to lie on – lesson learned that expensive online furniture doesn't always mean quality.

## Buyer's Guide

The right furniture can transform any space, but finding the perfect pieces can be overwhelming. This guide outlines key factors to consider when selecting furniture from Chase, helping you make informed decisions that balance style, functionality, and durability. 


### Dimensions and Space Measurement

Before selecting furniture, measure your room thoroughly. Include doorways, windowsills, and any existing furniture to ensure new pieces fit. Consider the room's shape and natural traffic flow when positioning larger items like beds or sofas. 

![Chase-Furniture-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Chase-Furniture-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### MATERIAL and CONSTRUCTION Quality

Invest in solid wood or engineered wood furniture for lasting quality. Check joints for craftsmanship and look for durable materials in contact with the floor (like block feet). Consider the finish's durability, especially if the furniture will go in high-traffic areas. 


### Storage and Functional Requirements

Assess your storage needs before choosing pieces with built-in storage. Look for furniture with adjustable shelving, multiple compartments, or hidden storage options. If space is limited, consider multi-functional furniture like ottomans with storage or Murphy beds.

### Style and Versatility

Chase offers a range of styles, from contemporary to traditional. Consider how the furniture pieces will complement your existing decor. Look for timeless pieces that can adapt to changing tastes rather than trendy items that may go out of style quickly.
