## Buyer's Guide

Long sleeve swimsuits offer excellent sun protection and versatility for various water activities. When selecting the right suit, consider these key factors to find a comfortable, durable option that meets your needs. 


### Construction and Material

The suit's material quality directly impacts performance and longevity. Look for high-stretch neoprene or four-way stretch fabrics that provide flexibility while maintaining shape. The material should glide smoothly through water and dry quickly to prevent irritation. 


### Fitting and Coverage

A proper fit enhances swim performance and prevents chafing. The suit should be snug without feeling restricting. Consider the coverage level based on your preference and intended use – full-coverage options provide more modesty and sun protection, while racerback styles offer greater flexibility for swimming. 


### Neck and Arm Design

Pay attention to how the neck and arm designs sit on your body. Compression necklines reduce drag and prevent water from entering, while long sleeves protect sun-exposed areas. The arm cuffs should fit comfortably without bunching during motion. 


### Maintenance and Care

Proper care ensures longevity and maintains the suit's shape. Most long sleeve swimsuits perform best with machine washing in a mesh bag to prevent snagging. Avoid bleach and high heat settings, as they can damage the neoprene material. 


## FAQ


### What are the key features to consider when buying a long sleeve swimsuit?

Long sleeve swimsuits offer excellent sun protection and warmth, making them ideal for cooler water temperatures and extended beach days. Key features include UV protection rating (look for UPF 50+), moisture-wicking fabric for quick drying, and thermal lining for added warmth. Padded cups and adjustability are also common for customizable fit. 

The material composition is crucial - look for quick-drying, chlorine-resistant fabrics like polyester blends. The style options range from competitive swimwear with tight silhouettes to more relaxed styles with coverage. Most long sleeve swimsuits come with built-in shorts. 


### How do you measure for the right size long sleeve swimsuit?

Measure your torso length from below your bust to your hips. Take your bust, waist, and hip measurements at the fullest part of each. These measurements help determine the correct style and fit, as well as the appropriate size for your body type. 

Swimsuit sizing varies by brand, so it's important to check specific sizing charts. Most manufacturers offer similar sizing standards, but some may run smaller or larger than others. Consider purchasing the same size you would for everyday clothes for consistency. 


### What's the difference between men's and women's long sleeve swimsuits?

Men's long sleeve swimsuits typically feature simpler, straighter lines with fewer design elements compared to women's options. They often have less padding and a more basic fit, with focus on modesty rather than shaping. 

Women's versions offer a wider range of styles, including padded cups, underwire support, and various neckline options. Thermal linings and compression fabrics are more common in women's designs, catering to active wear preferences and added warmth needs. 


### Can you wear long sleeve swimsuits for competitive swimming?

Long sleeve swimsuits may affect competitive swimming performance due to increased drag and reduced arm movement. Many competitive swimmers opt for shorter options with less material, though some choose long sleeve suits for cooler water temperatures or for sun protection. 

Some competitive swimwear brands produce long sleeve suits specifically for competitive use, incorporating features like strategic ventilation panels and minimal seam construction to reduce drag while providing essential coverage. 


### How do you care for long sleeve swimsuits?

Care instructions vary by material, but most long sleeve swimsuits should be hand washed or washed in a mesh bag using mild detergent. Avoid using hot water or harsh chemicals that can damage the fabric and reduce its effectiveness. 

After washing, hang the suit to dry or lay it flat away from direct sunlight. Do not fold or wring out the suit, as this can cause stretching and damage the stitching. Regular maintenance like checking for signs of wear and zipping closed before storage helps maintain the suit's longevity. 


### Is a long sleeve swimsuit legal for competitive swimming?

Long sleeve swimsuits are generally legal for competitive swimming, though regulation is evolving. US Swimming and FINA (Fédération Internationale de Natation) both permit long sleeve suits as part of standard competition attire, particularly in colder climates or with sun protection requirements. 

However, designs must follow specific rules regarding fabric thickness, seam construction, and overall fit to ensure fair competition. Always check the latest governing body regulations before choosing competitive swimwear.
