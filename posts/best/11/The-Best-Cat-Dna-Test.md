## Buyer's Guide

Cat DNA tests offer pet owners valuable insights into their feline's genetic background, health predispositions, and personality traits. Understanding these tests helps you make informed decisions about your cat's care and well-being. 


### Test Types and Offerings

Cat DNA tests fall into several categories: ancestry testing, health screening, and behavior analysis. Ancestry tests reveal a cat's geographical origins and breed mixing history. Health screening identifies genetic predispositions to diseases, allowing for proactive health management. Behavior analysis helps predict personality traits and susceptibilities to certain behaviors. 


### Sample Collection and Processing

The most common sample type is saliva collected via a swab under the cat's tongue. This method is simple and stress-free for most pets. Some tests also accept cheek cell samples or blood samples for more comprehensive results. After collection, samples are sent to a laboratory for genetic analysis. 


### Result Accuracy and Limitations

Tests use either single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis or whole genome sequencing. SNP tests are more common and analyze specific genetic markers, while whole genome sequencing provides a complete genetic profile. Accuracy varies by test, so choose one with high-quality validation and transparent methodology. 


### Vendor Reliability and Cost

Vendor selection is crucial, as reliable companies ensure accurate results and proper sample handling. Compare test costs, which typically range from $50 to $200, including shipping and processing fees. Consider additional services like health consultations or ancestry reports when evaluating value. 


## FAQ


### What is a cat DNA test?

A cat DNA test analyzes your pet's genetic material to determine their ancestry, identify specific breeds, and reveal potential health information. These tests require a small swab from your cat's cheek and send the sample to a laboratory for analysis. 

The results typically include details about your cat's breed origins, health predispositions, and characteristics. This information can help you better understand your pet and make informed decisions about their care. 


### How accurate are cat DNA tests?

Most cat DNA tests have an accuracy rate of 95% or higher when identifying breed origins and genetic traits. The tests analyze hundreds of genetic markers to generate their results, making them highly reliable for most purposes. 

However, it's important to note that no DNA test is 100% accurate, especially when it comes to mixed-breed cats. Results should be interpreted in the context of your cat's appearance and behavior, as these traits can also provide valuable information. 


### Which cat DNA test should I choose?

When selecting a cat DNA test, consider factors such as breed recognition accuracy, additional health information offered, and user-friendly features. Popular options include VetGen's BreedQuest, Wisdom Panel's cat tests, and Embark's cat genomics panel. 

Research each company's reputation, test methodology, and pricing before making a decision. Many companies offer free breed recognition with their basic test, while more extensive tests may be available for additional costs. 


### How do I submit a sample for testing?

Most cat DNA tests require a simple cheek swab, which you can perform yourself at home. The process takes only a few minutes and involves gently rubbing the swab against your cat's cheek several times. 

Once you've collected the sample, you'll need to send it to the testing facility using the provided prepaid envelope. Follow the specific instructions from the testing company regarding sample storage and shipment to ensure accurate results. 


### How long does it take to get results?

Processing times vary by testing company, but most cat DNA tests provide results within 2-4 weeks after receiving the sample. Some companies offer faster turnaround options, such as rush processing, for an additional fee. 

If you're working with a veterinarian for health-related questions, they may be able to expedite your results through a more direct testing pathway. This can sometimes reduce the overall processing time. 


### What should I consider before testing my cat?

Before proceeding with a cat DNA test, consider whether you need the additional information for health, breeding, or identification purposes. While the results can provide valuable insights, they may also raise questions about your cat's ancestry that you're not prepared to address. 

Review the testing company's privacy policies and how your cat's genetic information will be used to protect your pet's data. You may also want to discuss the results with a veterinarian or genetic counselor, especially if health-related information is included in the test results.
