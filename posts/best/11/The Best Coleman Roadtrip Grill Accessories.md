Made from durable chrome-plated steel, this grill grate fits perfectly on Coleman Roadtrip grills. At just 2. 58 pounds, it's a heavy-duty addition that makes cleaning a bit more work. While it's great for camping cooking and keeps your RV cooler than cooking inside, the dual-burner setup isn't as versatile as you might hope - you can't really cook on one side while keeping the other cool.

## Buyer's Guide

A Coleman Roadtrip Grill is an efficient way to cook while camping or on the go, but the right accessories can make your meals exceptional. These essential tools and gadgets will help you grill everything from steaks to vegetables and even breakfast items like eggs and pancakes. 


### Grill Accessories

The core accessories include replacement grilling elements, a drip pan, and cooking grates. The grill elements ensure consistent heat distribution, while the drip pan prevents flare-ups and keeps your camping site clean. Cooking grates come in different materials - stainless steel for durability or cast iron for even heat distribution.

### Cooking Tools

Invest in a grill brush to clean grates and a thermometer to check doneness. Tongs with a locking mechanism prevent food drops, and a meat fork with a built-in measurement scale helps judge doneness without piercing the meat. A long-handled spatula makes flipping awkwardly shaped foods like burgers and chicken breasts easier. 


### Storage Solutions

Organize your grill accessories with dedicated storage bags or containers that keep tools dry and prevent tangling wires. Consider a rolling case with dual wheels for easy transport, especially if you're moving between campsites. The case should have multiple compartments to keep cleaning supplies separate from cooking tools.

### Temperature Control Tools

When grilling, temperature control is key to consistent results. A grill cover helps maintain heat and cook food more quickly. Thermometers with probes let you monitor both grill and food temperatures. A drip pan with adjustable height allows you to create a drip shield and control the amount of fat that drips into the fire, affecting both cooking temperature and smoke levels. 


## FAQ

![Coleman-Roadtrip-Grill-Accessories-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Coleman-Roadtrip-Grill-Accessories-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is included in the Coleman Roadtrip Grill Accessories package?

The Coleman Roadtrip Grill Accessories package includes essential items that complement your grill, such as a carry case, spare hose connections, and quick-connect fitting. These accessories help protect your grill during transport and maintain proper functionality. 

The package also features a heavy-duty grill cover that provides UV protection and keeps your grill clean while not in use. Additionally, it includes a propane regulator compatible with most Coleman grills, ensuring consistent gas flow for reliable performance. 


### How do the hose connections work?

The spare hose connections are designed to replace any damaged or worn-out hoses. Each connection includes quick-connect fittings that attach directly to your grill's regulator, making it easy to replace standard-length hoses with longer options if needed. 

This system ensures you always have a functional hose connection, even if you lose one during transport or use. The quick-connect design allows for quick and secure attachment without the need for tools or compression fittings. 

![Coleman-Roadtrip-Grill-Accessories-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Coleman-Roadtrip-Grill-Accessories-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Is the grill cover effective against weather damage?

The heavy-duty grill cover is specifically engineered to withstand harsh weather conditions. It features a water-resistant coating that prevents moisture from seeping through, while breathable material allows condensation to escape, protecting your grill from rust and corrosion. 

The cover also includes UV protection to prevent fading of your grill's finish and protect the internal components from sun damage. Regular use of this cover can significantly extend the life of your Coleman grill. 


### What size regulator is compatible with the package?

The Coleman-provided regulator is designed to work with standard Coleman grill tanks. It features a standard 1/4" NPT connection that attaches directly to the tank valve and includes an adjustable flow control knob to manage gas pressure. 

While this regulator is compatible with most Coleman grills, it's important to verify that your specific grill model uses the standard connection type. Some newer models may require a different adapter. 

![Coleman-Roadtrip-Grill-Accessories-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Coleman-Roadtrip-Grill-Accessories-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can these accessories be used with any Coleman grill?

Most Coleman Roadtrip grill accessories are compatible with standard Coleman grills, including the classic Road Trip and Sport models. However, some newer grill models may have slightly different connection points or modifications. 

The carry case fits standard Coleman grill sizes, and all components are designed to work with the standard regulatory connections found on most Coleman grills. Always refer to your specific grill's manual for compatibility verification. 


### What maintenance is required for these accessories?

Regular maintenance of these accessories includes inspecting the hose connections for any signs of wear or damage before each use. Any damaged or loose connections should be replaced immediately to prevent leaks. 

The grill cover and regulator do not require cleaning, but it's a good practice to inspect them for any visible damage or wear during regular maintenance checks of your grill. Store the cover and regulator in a dry place when not in use.
