## Buyer's Guide

The Audio-Technica LP60x offers a balance of performance and value for money, making it a notable addition to the brand's stable of entry-level turntables. Key considerations when evaluating this model - and similar entry-level options - include deck quality, phono stages, and overall build durability. 


### Deck Quality and Construction

Entry-level turntables often prioritize durability and basic functionality. The LP60x features a composite tonearm with an aluminum tube, providing a solid foundation for the cartridge while keeping weight within the budget. The plinth incorporates MDF construction, which helps reduce vibrations and improve sound quality compared to lighter materials. 


### Phono Stage and Connectivity

The phono stage converts the signal from the cartridge into a line-level output, which most modern audio systems require. Basic models like the LP60x provide this functionality internally, while more advanced systems might offer additional options for customization. Consider whether you need multiple outputs or the ability to switch between different cartridge types. 


### Build Quality and Finish

Entry-level turntables often trade premium finishes for better sound quality and longevity. The LP60x features a black finish with silver trim, indicating a contemporary design while maintaining a practical appearance. Evaluate how the finish holds up to regular use and whether it matches your intended room decor. 


### Additional Features and Value Additions

Basic entry-level models focus on fundamental sound reproduction. The LP60x includes features like a built-in volume control and plug-and-play USB connectivity for quick setup. However, advanced features like Bluetooth or traditional phono stage options might influence your decision based on your specific needs. 


## FAQ


### What is the Audio Technica Lp60x?

The Audio Technica Lp60x is a high-quality moving-coil phono cartridge designed for use with turntables. It's known for its precise sound reproduction and durability, making it a popular choice among audiophiles. 

Developed by Audio Technica, the Lp60x features a dual-magnet moving coil design that enhances tracking accuracy and reduces distortion. The cartridge includes a replaceable stylus and comes with both horizontal and vertical tracking angles. 


### What stylus options are available for the Audio Technica Lp60x?

The Lp60x offers two main stylus options: the standard AT2V diamond stylus and the AT3V diamond stylus with a tighter tracking angle. The AT3V is recommended for use with modern, more aggressive LPs or when precise tracking is needed. 

Both stylus options are interchangeable, so you can switch between them depending on your specific needs and preferences. The replaceable stylus system helps extend the cartridge's lifespan and performance. 


### Can the Audio Technica Lp60x be used with different turntables?

Yes, the Lp60x is compatible with most standard turntables that use a 45mm tonearm. Its dual-magnet moving coil design works effectively with a wide range of cartridge mounts and phono stages. 

However, it's important to check your turntable's specifications and ensure it has the correct tracking weight and compliance settings for the Lp60x. Consult your turntable's manual or manufacturer's website for specific compatibility information. 


### What's the difference between the Lp60 and Lp60x?

The Lp60x is the latest iteration of the Lp60 cartridge, with improved specifications and materials. The primary differences include upgraded magnets, slightly improved tracking angles, and refined manufacturing processes. 

Both cartridges use the same diamond stylus options and mounting system, but the Lp60x offers enhanced performance and reliability. While the Lp60 remains available, many audiophiles prefer the updated Lp60x for its minor improvements and better value proposition. 


### How much does an Audio Technica Lp60x cost?

The Audio Technica Lp60x typically retails for between $150 and $200, depending on the retailer and country of purchase. The cost includes the cartridge, mounting hardware, and replaceable stylus. 

Stylus replacements cost approximately $50-60 each, while professional installation or setup services may range from $75 to $150, depending on local rates and the complexity of your turntable setup. 


### How long does an Audio Technica Lp60x usually last?

With proper care and regular stylus replacement, an Audio Technica Lp60x cartridge can last 5-10 years before requiring significant maintenance or replacement. The diamond stylus typically lasts 2-3 years with regular use. 

Tracking the cartridge's performance, monitoring wear patterns, and replacing the stylus at the recommended intervals can help extend the Lp60x's lifespan and maintain optimal sound quality.
