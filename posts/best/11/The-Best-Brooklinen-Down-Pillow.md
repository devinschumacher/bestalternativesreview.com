## Buyer's Guide

A Brooklinen down pillow combines traditional comfort with modern craftsmanship. These pillows feature premium down cores encased in soft, breathable fabrics. Understanding key aspects of construction, filling quality, and care requirements will help you select the right pillow for your needs. 


### Construction and Design

Brooklinen down pillows typically offer three main designs: traditional encasements, pillow protectors, and custom fit options. Traditional encasements provide basic protection while allowing the down to maintain shape. Pillow protectors offer additional barrier against allergens and moisture. Custom fit options ensure proper pillow dimensions for specific mattress types.

### Down Quality and Quantity

The quality of down directly impacts a pillow's loft, durability, and comfort. Look for pillows filled with high-quality, hypoallergenic down clusters. The quantity of down affects the pillow's weight and resilience. Standard pillow weights range from 1.5 to 3 pounds, with heavier options providing more substantial support. 


### Casing Materials and Breathability

Pillow casings should use breathable materials like 100% cotton sateen or linen to prevent moisture buildup. High-thread-count fabrics enhance durability and reduce feather migration. Some premium models incorporate body-contouring designs or temperature-regulating technologies for enhanced sleep comfort.

### Care and Maintenance

Regular care is essential for maintaining a down pillow's quality and longevity. Most Brooklinen pillows can be machine-washed using gentle settings and tumble-dried on low heat. It's important to check specific care instructions based on your pillow model and fabric type. Proper storage in a dry place prevents clumping and odor development. 


## FAQ

![Brooklinen-Down-Pillow-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Brooklinen-Down-Pillow-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is the filling material for Brooklinen down pillows?

Brooklinen down pillows use a blend of premium goose down and down alternative fibers to create a comfortable, hypoallergenic sleeping solution. The down is sourced from Grade B European white goose down, while the down alternative provides an allergen-free option for those who cannot use real down. 

Each pillow contains approximately 250 grams of down and a generous 1200 grams of down alternative, ensuring a fluffy, supportive sleep environment while accommodating various allergy concerns. 


### How are these pillows sized and fitted?

The Brooklinen down pillow comes in two standard sizes: King at 20" x 26" and Queen at 18" x 26". These measurements accommodate most standard mattress sizes, with the extra length providing excellent support for side sleepers. 

The pillow features a fitted design with elastic corners that prevent shifting during the night. This construction keeps the pillow's shape intact and ensures it remains comfortable throughout the sleep cycle. 

![Brooklinen-Down-Pillow-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Brooklinen-Down-Pillow-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the key temperature-regulating features?

These pillows incorporate a blend of down and down alternative materials that help maintain an optimal sleeping temperature. The down provides natural insulation, while the alternative fibers wick away moisture, keeping the pillow fresh and supportive during sleep. 

The cover is made from Brooklinen's signature 300-thread-count percale cotton, which allows air circulation while maintaining a cool sleep surface. This combination of materials helps regulate body temperature throughout the night. 


### How does the pillow maintain its shape over time?

Each Brooklinen down pillow includes a hidden down-proof inner casing that protects the filling materials while allowing them to breathe. This protective layer prevents clumping and maintains the pillow's fluffy texture over time. 

The outer percale cotton cover not only provides durability but also helps distribute pressure evenly during sleep. This dual-layer construction helps maintain the pillow's shape and supports proper sleeping posture. 

![Brooklinen-Down-Pillow-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Brooklinen-Down-Pillow-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What cleaning options are available for the pillow covers?

The pillow covers are machine washable to keep the sleep environment clean and fresh. The cover can be removed and washed separately from the inner pillow, making it easy to maintain hygiene standards. 

For daily use, spot cleaning with a damp cloth is recommended for quick maintenance. In-depth cleaning should be done weekly, using the pillow cover's care instructions to preserve the integrity of both the cover and the inner pillow. 


### How does the pillow compare to traditional down pillows?

Unlike traditional down pillows that may require regular fluffing, Brooklinen down pillows maintain their shape due to the protective inner casing. This feature reduces maintenance while retaining the premium feel of down bedding. 

These pillows offer a more accessible alternative to expensive down options, providing similar comfort levels at a more affordable price point. The blend of down and alternative materials makes them suitable for a wider range of sleep preferences and allergies.
