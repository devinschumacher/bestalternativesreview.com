## Buyer's Guide

A 13x17 inch frame is a popular choice for displaying photos, artwork, and documents due to its generous size while maintaining portability. Understanding the key aspects of these frames can help you select one that perfectly complements your item and your space. 


### Size Compatibility

When measuring your item, remember that the frame extends beyond the edges. Standard mat openings for 13x17 frames range from 10.5x14.5 inches to 12x16 inches, allowing for a 1.25 to 2-inch border. Consider choosing a frame with precise measurements that match your item's dimensions for a clean, professional look. 


### Frame Styles

From traditional wood to modern metal finishes, 13x17 frames come in various styles. Consider the frame's visual weight - thicker frames create a heavier look, while thinner frames maintain a lighter appearance. The frame's style should also match your room's décor, with colors and patterns that complement your existing furnishings. 


### Mattes and Matting

The mat that separates your display item from the frame's interior surface helps protect your item and enhance its appearance. Different mat materials (paper, cardboard, or foamcore) offer varying levels of protection and visual appeal. Consider UV protection coating for the mat to prevent fading, especially for photos. 

Mat cutouts should be carefully measured to allow proper viewing without distortion. Common mat shapes include straight edges, rounded corners, and custom cuts for unique artwork. The mat's color and texture can dramatically affect how your display item appears, so choose complementary elements that enhance the piece's color and detail. 


### Mounting and Hardware

Secure mounting is crucial for displaying a 13x17 inch frame. Check if the frame includes hanging hardware suitable for your display location. Different frames offer various mounting options, including wire, sawtooth, or D-rings. Consider the weight of your item and choose hardware rated for adequate support. 

For wall mounting, ensure the frame comes with appropriate wall anchors and screws. The mounting system should account for the frame's weight, with some designs distributing weight across multiple points for added stability. Consider the frame's hanging mechanism; some designs allow for easier alignment and adjustment. 


## FAQ


### What is the size of an 13x17 frame?

Standard 13x17 frames measure 13 inches by 17 inches inside the frame, providing ample space for a variety of artwork and photographs. 

The overall frame dimensions typically range from 15.5 to 17 inches in height and 19.5 to 21 inches in width, depending on the specific frame design and materials used. 


### What materials are 13x17 frames made from?

Common materials include wood, metal, and plastic, each offering different strengths in terms of durability, weight, and visual appeal. 

Wood frames are often stained or painted, while metal frames provide a sleek contemporary look and are available in multiple finishes. 


### What is the standard frame thickness?

The typical frame thickness ranges from 1.5 to 2 inches, with premium frames often exceeding 2 inches for added depth and visual impact. 

Some specialized frames, particularly in metal or plastic construction, can be as thin as 0.5 inches while still providing adequate support for the artwork. 


### How do I calculate the required frame size for artwork?

To ensure proper fit, measure your artwork's width and height, then add 1 inch to each dimension for the frame's border. 

For example, an 8x10 inch photograph would require a 9x11 inch frame. 


### What frame options are available for stretching canvas?

Specialty frames with deep channels are designed to accommodate canvas artwork, with common sizes ranging from 1.5 to 4 inches in depth. 

These frames often include built-in hooks and hardware specifically for canvas displays. 


### How do I choose the right frame finish?

Consider the room's lighting and color scheme. Glossy finishes enhance detail but may reflect glare, while matte finishes offer a more subtle appearance. 

For traditional settings, gold or bronze frames complement classical or formal rooms, while contemporary spaces benefit from black, white, or brushed metal finishes.
