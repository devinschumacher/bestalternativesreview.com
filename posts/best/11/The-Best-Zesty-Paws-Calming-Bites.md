## FAQ


### What are Zesty Paws Calming Bites?

Calming bites are specially formulated treats designed to help pets manage anxiety and stress. Zesty Paws Calming Bites contain natural ingredients like CBD oil, chamomile, and valerian root to promote relaxation and calmness. 

These bite-sized treats are made from real fish and vegetables, making them both delicious and nutritious. Unlike traditional calming aids, these treats can be given daily as a part of your pet's regular routine. 


### What ingredients are in Zesty Paws Calming Bites?

The primary ingredients include organic krill oil (rich in omega-3 fatty acids), chamomile extract, and valerian root. Each bite also contains organic chicken liver powder and calcium carbonate for additional nutrients. 

Minor ingredients include natural flavoring (based on the pet's species), seaweed extract, and a proprietary blend of antioxidants. There are no artificial preservatives, colors, or flavors in the product. 


### How do the calming bites work?

The natural ingredients work together to support your pet's overall well-being. Omega-3 fatty acids help reduce inflammation and support healthy neurotransmitter function. Chamomile and valerian root have been used traditionally to promote relaxation and reduce anxiety. 

The treats should be given daily to pets experiencing stress or anxiety. Their soothing effects typically become apparent within 20-30 minutes of consumption. 


### Are these treats safe for all pets?

Calming bites are generally safe for most pets, especially those over 12 weeks of age. Pets with known allergies to fish or shellfish should avoid this product. Always consult your veterinarian before introducing new supplements or treats to your pet's diet. 

Begin with one treat and observe your pet for 24 hours to ensure no adverse reactions occur. This is particularly important if your pet has a history of health issues or is currently taking medications. 


### How should I give these treats?

Administer the calming bites as needed based on your pet's individual needs. For daily use, give one bite per 25 pounds of body weight. Alternatively, you can break a single treat into smaller pieces for more frequent administration. 

These treats can be given directly from your hand, added to your pet's food, or placed in their favorite toy. For pets who are stressed in certain environments, carrying the treats with you can provide reassurance and support. 


### How long do the effects last?

The calming effects typically last between 2-4 hours, though individual results may vary. The duration of effectiveness can be affected by factors like your pet's stress level, the severity of their condition, and their overall health. 

If your pet requires extended support, consider giving the treats daily or using them as needed based on specific stressors. For pets with chronic anxiety, your veterinarian may recommend using the treats in combination with other therapies.
