### [Ninja 591KKUC680 64oz Processor Bowl](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Ninja+Blender+Parts?utm\_term=ninja-591kkuc680-64oz-processor-bowl)

![Ninja 591KKUC680 64oz Processor Bowl | Image](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcR0U2MZxSNwaK0M7vrZokGuWoDzZ1IaWfCB\_fziZe3CvNXebRnZr6BWqR3vXM-kQtMNFiaqDidmI1T4nuvyAbRO27u6fywu&usqp=CAY)

This processor bowl works great with the Ninja blender system, though you'll want to make sure you get the right part for your specific model – one reviewer had issues getting it to fit their base. The bowl itself is pretty solid, but a couple of folks noticed the drive mechanism broke after just a bit of use, letting liquid leak in. Overall, it's a decent part once you get it to work, though the customer support for returns isn't super helpful. 


### [Ninja 72 oz. Pitcher Lid with Locking Handle](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Ninja+Blender+Parts?utm\_term=ninja-72-oz-pitcher-lid-with-locking-handle)

When your blender's original lid starts to show its age, finding an exact replacement can make or break your morning routine. This original Ninja lid fits perfectly on the 72oz pitcher with its distinctive rounded edges, though some models might need the right version to prevent frustration. The rubber seal holds up well for everyday use, but minor scuffs from handling are to be expected - it's all about getting that freshly blended smoothie back into your life without hassle.

Two recent buyers encountered issues: one reported the pitcher wouldn't twist into place on their motor housing, while another couldn't get it to work with their existing blender. The defective nature of the purchase meant both customers ended up having to track down the correct pitcher elsewhere, highlighting compatibility challenges despite official compatibility claims.

## Buyer's Guide

Addies the power of professional blending to your kitchen with Ninja blender parts, but getting the right components for your model can be overwhelming. Our detailed guide helps you understand the key parts, their functions, and how to choose the right replacement or upgrade for your blender. 


### Blade Assemblies

High-quality stainless steel blades are crucial for efficient blending, with different blade patterns optimized for various mixing tasks. Standard blades handle liquids and soft solids best, while specialized blades like vortex or crushing blades provide enhanced performance for ice crushing and tough ingredients. 

![Ninja-Blender-Parts-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Ninja-Blender-Parts-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Motor and Base Components

The motor controls blending power and durability, with rated wattage indicating maximum usage capacity. Consider the base construction, as reinforced materials like stainless steel or plastic with metal inserts offer better weight distribution and stability under load. 


### Cord and Power Supply

Look for flexible braided cables with secure clasps for the blender base, as these resist tangling and provide safe handling during use. For convenience and safety, choose models with detachable power cords and grounded three-prong plugs when socket access is limited.

### Replacement Considerations

When selecting replacement parts, always refer to your blender model number and check compatibility with the original manufacturer's specifications. Premium-quality replacements made from food-grade materials ensure both performance and safety in your kitchen blender. 


## FAQ

![Ninja-Blender-Parts-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Ninja-Blender-Parts-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What kind of blender parts are included in a Ninja Blender?

The basic set includes a blender container with lid, blade assembly, tamper, measuring cup, base, and power cord. Blender accessories may vary by model, but common extras include ice crusher blades, \_variable speed settings, and pulse function. 

Replacement parts are available separately for containers, blades, and seals. The blender base and power cord are typically included with each blender model and not sold as replacement items. 


### How do I assemble the blender parts?

First, attach the blade assembly to the blender container. Then secure the lid in place. For measuring cups and tamper, these usually attach to the container or lid via click-lock mechanisms. 

If your blender has additional features like an ice crush function, consult the specific instructions for assembly. Basic models typically require little more than ensuring all parts are properly locked in place. 

![Ninja-Blender-Parts-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Ninja-Blender-Parts-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What maintenance do the blender parts need?

The container and lid should be hand washed after each use. The blade assembly and tamper can go in the dishwasher, while the measuring cup may need manual cleaning depending on your model. 

For optimal performance, inspect the blade assembly for wear and replace if damaged. The blender base and power cord should only be cleaned using a dry cloth. 


### How long do Ninja Blender parts last?

With regular use, blade assemblies typically maintain their sharpness for 6-9 months before needing replacement. Containers and lids usually last 2-3 years with proper care. 

Replacement parts are available from Ninja and authorized dealers. If your blender is still under warranty, contact Ninja customer support for assistance.

### Are the blender parts dishwasher safe?

The blender container and lid are dishwasher safe, though hand washing is recommended for better cleaning. The blade assembly can go in the dishwasher, but remove the plastic parts first. 

The measuring cup is dishwasher safe on select models, but check your specific blender's instructions. The base and power cord should always be cleaned by hand using a dry cloth. 


### How do I replace a broken blender part?

Reference your blender's model number and part name in online stores or contact Ninja's customer support for exact replacement parts. Replacement blades and containers usually ship within 7-14 days. 

For the base or power cord, these often come as a complete replacement unit. Contact Ninja customer service for guidance on obtaining replacement parts.
