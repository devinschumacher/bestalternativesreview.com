## Buyer's Guide

Under bed storage bins are an excellent way to maximize your bedroom's storage capacity while keeping the room looking organized and clutter-free. These versatile containers come in various materials, sizes, and designs to suit different needs and preferences. When selecting the right storage bin for your space, consider factors like bin material, storage capacity, access design, and matching sets. 


### Material Options

Common materials for under bed storage bins include plastic, fabric, and metal. Plastic bins offer durability and water resistance, making them ideal for storing seasonal clothing and shoes. Fabric bins provide excellent moisture protection and come in various sizes and shapes, from pouches to tiered setups. Metal bins, typically made from steel or aluminum, offer exceptional strength and longevity but may be heavier and less flexible in configuration options. 


### Storage Capacity

Calculate the space available under your bed to determine how much storage you need. Consider the bin's internal volume, depth, and ability to stack. For small beds or limited space, look for compact bins that maximize vertical storage. Larger beds can accommodate deeper bins or multiple tiers. Factor in the weight of items you plan to store, as heavier loads may require sturdier construction materials. 


### Access Design

The shape and opening design significantly impact usability. Bins with hinged lids or doors provide secure closure and easy access but take up more space when open. Pouch-style bins offer quick access but may telescope outwards, requiring careful positioning under the bed. Tiered storage solutions maximize vertical space but complicate retrieval of lower items. Consider how you plan to organize and access contents when choosing the bin's design. 


### Matching Sets

Morningwood's under bed storage bins come in various materials, sizes, and designs to help you find the right solution for your space. Mixing and matching different styles or materials can create visual interest and flexibility. Consider coordinating multiple bins for a consistent look, or choose contrasting pieces to add depth and variety to your storage solution. 


## FAQ


### What are under bed storage bins?

Under bed storage bins are containers designed to fit underneath standard beds. They range in size from small, compact units for shoes and accessories to larger bins for seasonal clothing and out-of-season items. 

These bins typically feature lids that secure contents and prevent dust accumulation. Some models include wheels for easy movement or ventilation ports to maintain freshness. 


### What materials are under bed storage bins made from?

Most under bed storage bins are made from lightweight polypropylene or HDPE plastic, known for their durability and resistance to water and mildew. Some premium options use recycled materials. 

Steel bins are also available for heavier loads, while bamboo and wicker versions offer a more decorative look. 


### How much weight can under bed storage bins hold?

Standard plastic bins typically support up to 100 pounds when placed on their sides. Steel bins can handle significantly more weight, often up to 200 pounds or more. 

Always check specific product weight ratings, as variations exist. Overloading can compromise the bin's structure and effectiveness. 


### What sizes are available for under bed storage bins?

Storage bin sizes range from small 12-inch square units to extra-large 20-inch diameter bins. Common depths include 10, 12, and 14 inches to fit various bed types and available space. 

Some manufacturers offer customizable sets that allow you to mix and match different sizes based on your storage needs. 


### How do under bed storage bins compare to other bed storage solutions?

Under bed storage bins excel in organizing small to medium-sized items like shoes, seasonal clothing, and accessories. They're particularly effective when combined with a high-quality, breathable mattress protector and foundation system. 

For larger items or heavy loads, consider overhead storage solutions like dressers or multi-level storage units that provide better weight distribution and accessibility. 


### What maintenance requirements do under bed storage bins have?

Most under bed storage bins need minimal maintenance. Regularly clean the exterior with soap and water, and empty bins monthly to check for moisture accumulation and ensure proper ventilation. 

Store bins with lids open to air out contents between uses, especially for items that produce moisture, like shoes and athletic gear.
