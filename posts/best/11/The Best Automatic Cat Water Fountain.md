## Buyer's Guide

Automatic cat water fountains combine modern convenience with your cat's hydration needs. These water stations mimic natural water flow, encouraging cats to drink while keeping their water fresh and moving. Understanding key features helps you choose the right fountain for your furry friend. 


### Water Flow and Design

Look for fountains with adjustable flow rates to accommodate different cat preferences. Gentle flow options are ideal for older cats or those with health conditions. Consider the fountain's design - some models have high flow rates for indoor water features, while others have quieter streams suitable for multi-cat households or apartments. 

![Automatic-Cat-Water-Fountain-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Automatic-Cat-Water-Fountain-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Filter Systems and Maintenance

Effective filter systems remove impurities and improve water quality. Common filter sizes range from basic charcoal filters to multi-stage systems that include minerals and activated carbon. Regular maintenance schedules reduce cleaning needs, with some fountains requiring weekly filter changes and monthly tank cleanings. 


### Suction and Air Exposure

Automatic fountains use small pumps to recirculate water, which can create suction that affects drinkable water volume. Choose a design that minimizes air exposure to prevent bacterial growth. Some models feature sealed reservoirs or aerators that maintain water quality while optimizing flow rates. 

![Automatic-Cat-Water-Fountain-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Automatic-Cat-Water-Fountain-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Power Consumption and Durability

Energy-efficient fountains reduce operating costs, with some models using less than a watt of power. Durability is crucial for daily use - look for construction materials like stainless steel, BPA-free plastic, or ceramic. The base should be wide and stable to prevent tipping, especially with heavy water tanks. 


## FAQ

![Automatic-Cat-Water-Fountain-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Automatic-Cat-Water-Fountain-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is an automatic cat water fountain?

Automatic cat water fountains are electronic devices designed to provide cats with a continuously flowing water source. These fountains typically feature a built-in pump that circulates water through a filter system, maintaining freshness and promoting healthy hydration. 

Unlike stagnant bowls, flowing water is more appealing to many cats, potentially increasing their water consumption and overall health. These fountains often include features like adjustable flow rates, night-time shut-off, and automatic refilling via a pet water fountain attachment hose. 


### How does an automatic water fountain work?

Most automatic water fountains feature a submerged pump that circulates water through a series of filters. The pump draws water from the reservoir, filters it, and returns it to the surface through a decorative spout or fountain feature. The circulation helps maintain water freshness and prevents sediment buildup. 

Modern fountains often include automatic shut-off mechanisms to prevent overfilling, especially during the night. Some models also feature adjustable flow settings and LED lights that can help attract cats to the water source. 

![Automatic-Cat-Water-Fountain-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Automatic-Cat-Water-Fountain-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What maintenance is required for a cat water fountain?

Regular maintenance is crucial for keeping an automatic water fountain functioning properly and ensuring water quality. This typically involves weekly cleaning of the water bowl and filter system, monthly replacement of the filter cartridge, and periodic inspection of the pump and electronic components. 

Check the water level daily and ensure the pump is functioning correctly. The fountain's exterior should be cleaned weekly, while the pump housing and filter housing require more frequent cleaning based on usage and environmental factors. 


### Do cats need a water fountain?

While not essential, automatic water fountains can significantly increase a cat's water consumption, which is beneficial for their overall health. Cats naturally prefer running water, and a fountain can mimic this natural behavior, encouraging them to drink more water. 

However, not all cats will use a water fountain. If your cat prefers a water bowl, ensure you change the water daily and keep the bowl clean. A water fountain can be an excellent addition to your cat's water routine, but it's important to introduce it gradually to encourage acceptance. 

![Automatic-Cat-Water-Fountain-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Automatic-Cat-Water-Fountain-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What features should I look for in a cat water fountain?

When selecting a water fountain, consider features that enhance both functionality and cat appeal. Essential features include adjustable flow rates, easy-to-clean bowls and filters, and automatic shut-off mechanisms. Many pet owners also prefer models with LED lights or decorative spouts. 

Think about the water capacity, as this affects how often you need to refill. Some fountains include night-time features like LED lighting or quiet operation for late-night refills. If you have multiple cats, consider a fountain with multiple output spouts. 


### How much water does a cat water fountain use?

The water consumption of an automatic cat water fountain can vary based on usage frequency and filter quality. On average, a single-cat household might use between 1-2 gallons per day, while multi-cat households could use up to 4 gallons per day. 

Water efficiency is important, especially if you're concerned about water bills. Some fountains use less water by continuously recirculating a small amount rather than constantly refilling. Consider the water reservoir capacity and how often you need to top up the fountain.
