## FAQ

![Chlorhexidine-Wipes-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Chlorhexidine-Wipes-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is chlorhexidine?

Chlorhexidine is a broad-spectrum antiseptic agent commonly used for skin disinfection and wound care. It effectively kills bacteria, fungi, and some viruses, making it particularly useful for preventing infections in medical settings. 

The most common form for home use is in antiseptic wipes, which provide a convenient way to disinfect surfaces and skin before and after procedures. 


### How do chlorhexidine wipes work?

When applied to the skin or surfaces, chlorhexidine disrupts the cell walls of microorganisms, causing them to die. Its water-binding properties also allow it to remain active for extended periods on both living tissue and non-porous surfaces. 

These wipes contain an effective concentration of chlorhexidine that provides rapid antimicrobial action, typically within 30 seconds of application. 

![Chlorhexidine-Wipes-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Chlorhexidine-Wipes-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the benefits of using chlorhexidine wipes?

Chlorhexidine wipes offer broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, making them effective against a wide range of pathogens including Staphylococcus, Escherichia coli, and fungi. 

These wipes are particularly useful for quick surface cleaning and hand disinfection, reducing the need for more complex cleaning protocols in both healthcare and home settings. 


### How should chlorhexidine wipes be used?

Use the wipe to gently clean the surface or skin area, making sure to cover the entire surface. For best results, allow the solution to remain in contact with the surface for 30-60 seconds before removing the wipe. 

Always follow package instructions for proper application and disposal of the wipe to ensure effective cleaning and prevent cross-contamination. 

![Chlorhexidine-Wipes-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Chlorhexidine-Wipes-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can chlorhexidine wipes be used on sensitive skin?

While generally considered safe, chlorhexidine may cause irritation in some individuals, particularly those with sensitive skin or allergies. If irritation occurs, discontinue use and consult a healthcare provider. 

For sensitive areas, perform a patch test before widespread use to determine if the wipe will cause adverse reactions. 


### How long do chlorhexidine wipes remain effective?

Once the wipe is activated, it maintains its antimicrobial properties for the duration of its intended use. This typically ranges from 30 seconds to 5 minutes, depending on the specific product and environmental factors. 

Unused portions should be stored according to package instructions, usually in a sealed container or wrapper, to maintain product integrity and effectiveness.
