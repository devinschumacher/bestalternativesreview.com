## Buyer's Guide

When it comes to selecting the right Gigi hard wax, several key factors influence its performance and longevity. Understanding these aspects helps in choosing a product that meets specific grooming needs while considering personal preferences and hair characteristics. 


### Formulation and Base Ingredients

High-quality Gigi hard wax typically contains natural beeswax combined with additional ingredients like vegetable oils, botanical extracts, and conditioning agents. The balance of these components affects the wax's firmness, spreadability, and moisturizing properties. 


### Texture and Consistency

The right texture allows for precise application and holds hair in place. Generally, Gigi hard waxes range from medium to firm consistency, with options for various preferences. The spreadability affects how easily the product can be applied and styled. 


### Co-washing Compatibility

Many Gigi hard waxes can be used with co-washing products, making them suitable for both oil-based and water-based cleaning routines. Check the product instructions for compatibility with your preferred washing method. 


### Sustainability and Brand Philosophy

Consider brands that use eco-friendly packaging and natural ingredients. The company's sustainability practices often reflect in their product formulations, making it easier to choose an environmentally conscious option. 


## FAQ


### What is Gigi hard wax made of?

Our hard wax is crafted from a premium blend of natural beeswax and high-quality resins, providing exceptional durability and protection for your floors. 

This formulation delivers lasting luster while resisting scratches, scuffs, and everyday wear, making it ideal for busy homes and high-traffic areas. 


### How long does Gigi hard wax take to dry?

Once applied, Gigi hard wax needs 24-48 hours to fully cure and develop its optimal hardness and resistance properties. 

During this time, avoid walking on the treated surface to prevent potential scuffs or marks before the coating is fully dry and hardened. 


### What surface types are suitable for Gigi hard wax?

While Gigi hard wax works well on many surfaces, it performs best on solid wood floors, engineered wood, and concrete. For other floor types, we recommend consulting with a professional first. 

This product should not be used on ceramic or porcelain tiles, laminate flooring, or any surface with significant existing damage or warping. 


### How many coats of Gigi hard wax are needed?

For optimal results, we recommend applying 2-3 thin coats of Gigi hard wax, allowing 24 hours between each subsequent application. 

This multi-coat process builds up a robust protective layer while maintaining a natural wood appearance, though single coats are possible for touch-ups or urgent applications. 


### What maintenance requirements does Gigi hard wax have?

Mild cleaning is sufficient for maintaining Gigi hard wax finishes. We recommend using microfiber cloths and mild soap solutions for regular cleaning. 

For more thorough cleaning or removal of stubborn stains, a professional-grade maintenance product specifically designed for hard wax finishes can be used, following the product instructions carefully. 


### How long does Gigi hard wax protection last?

With proper application and maintenance, a single application of Gigi hard wax can provide protection lasting 3-5 years on solid wood floors and 2-3 years on engineered wood. 

Regular maintenance and occasional touch-ups can extend the life of the protective layer, while heavy traffic or high humidity may reduce the overall protection duration.
