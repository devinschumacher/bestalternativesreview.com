### Cushioning Technology

The primary cushioning comes from a blown EVA midsole with visible bladders, providing a plush ride with decent energy return. The heel has a firm ground feel to lock down the foot, while the forefoot remains more flexible for natural running mechanics. 


### Fit and Width Options

Asics typically runs wide, so consider sizing down if you prefer a more snug fit. The Dynablast models usually offer true to size widths, with some variations between different styles. The roomy toe box allows for natural foot movement during running.
