## Buyer's Guide

Real cocodrilos (Crocodylus acutus) are fascinating animals with distinct physical characteristics. Understanding these traits is crucial when identifying real cocodrilos, distinguishing them from other crocodilian species, or recognizing authentic crocodile-related products. 


### Physical Characteristics

Real cocodrilos are characterized by their long, powerful snouts filled with conical teeth and armored scales. Adults typically range from 13 to 16 feet in length and can weigh between 450 to 1,100 pounds. Their eyes have a distinctive yellow color with black pupils. 

![Real-Coco-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Real-Coco-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Distribution and Habitat

Native to the Americas, real cocodrilos inhabit freshwater environments including rivers, swamps, and coastal areas from Southeast Mexico to Colombia. Understanding their geographical range helps identify potential sightings and authentic products related to the species. 


### Behavior and Ecology

In the wild, real cocodrilos are crepuscular predators, most active at dawn and dusk. They feed on various prey including fish, turtles, and small mammals. Captive specimens require specific environmental conditions to thrive, including sufficient water space and appropriate diet. 

![Real-Coco-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Real-Coco-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Distinguishing Authentic Products

When purchasing crocodile-related products, look for genuine identification markings or documentation. Real cocodrilos are listed under CITES Appendix I, and their products must legally bear specific certification. Avoid products from protected areas or known illegal sources. 


## FAQ

![Real-Coco-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Real-Coco-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is Real Coco?

Real Coco refers to products made from coca leaves, specifically those derived from the coca plant (Erythroxylum coca). These products are traditionally used in Andean countries for their stimulating properties and cultural significance. 

Common Real Coco products include teas and infusions that contain coca leaf extract, which is believed to provide energy and improve digestion when consumed in moderation. 


### Where can I purchase Real Coco products?

Real Coco products can be found in specialty shops, health food stores, and online retailers that focus on South American or Andean products. Some popular brands include Inka Herbs and Andean Botanicals. 

Always verify the authenticity of the product through customer reviews and third-party certifications to ensure you're purchasing genuine Real Coco products. 

![Real-Coco-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Real-Coco-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Are Real Coco products safe for consumption?

When consumed in moderation as a tea or infusion, Real Coco products are generally considered safe for most adults. However, they contain caffeine and mild psychoactive compounds, so people with caffeine sensitivities or certain medical conditions should use caution. 

As with any dietary supplement, it's advisable to consult with a healthcare provider before starting regular consumption, especially if you're pregnant, nursing, or taking medications. 


### What are the potential health benefits of Real Coco?

Traditional uses of Real Coco have associated it with improved digestion, increased alertness, and reduced appetite. Modern research suggests it may also have anti-inflammatory properties and potential benefits for cardiovascular health. 

However, more extensive scientific studies are needed to confirm these potential benefits, and consumers should approach these claims with reasonable expectations. 

![Real-Coco-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Real-Coco-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do Real Coco products affect caffeine sensitivity?

Real Coco products contain about 10-15mg of caffeine per serving, significantly less than coffee or tea. This lower caffeine content makes them suitable for those who are caffeine-sensitive but still enjoy a mild stimulant effect. 

However, individual sensitivity can vary, and some people may still experience jitters or sleep disruptions even at these lower levels. If you have caffeine sensitivities, start with a small serving and monitor your body's response. 


### Are there any potential side effects to watch for?

While generally safe, Real Coco products can cause side effects in some individuals, including increased heart rate, anxiety, and insomnia, especially when consumed in large quantities. People with existing heart conditions, anxiety disorders, or severe caffeine sensitivity should use caution. 

Some users report mild gastrointestinal discomfort, particularly when switching from regular coffee or tea consumption to Real Coco. If you experience persistent side effects, consider reducing your intake or discontinuing use.
