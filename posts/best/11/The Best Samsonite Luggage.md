## Buyer's Guide

Luggage from Samsonite combines durability with style, making it a popular choice among travelers. When selecting a Samsonite suitcase or travel bag, consider factors that impact longevity, such as material quality and construction details. The right size and features will ensure your bag meets travel requirements while keeping your valuables secure. 


### Material Quality

The outer shell material determines how well your luggage resists scratches, dents, and water damage. Look for bags constructed with Terylene or Teflon-coated fibers, as these offer excellent protection against stains and wear. The quality of zippers and wheels also impacts longevity - opt for bags with YKK zip pulls and ball-bearing spinner wheels for smoother operation. 


### Size and Dimensions

Check the internal dimensions before selecting a size, as external measurements can be deceiving. Standard carry-on dimensions are 22" x 14" x 9", while domestic checked bags typically measure 27" x 18" x 11". For international travel, consider oversized checked bags or duffels measuring 30" x 19" x 8". Always verify airline baggage policies to avoid fees or restricted sizing. 


### Features and Functionality

Key features include multiple pockets for organization, rolltop closures for securing contents, and padding on handle and wheels for comfort. Look for built-in check cord and sleeve compatible with tethers for child seats. Some models offer TSA-approved lock ports, allowing agents to unlock your bag without damaging the fastening mechanism. 


### Warranty and Customer Support

Check for the type of warranty included with each model. Samsonite typically provides multi-year warranties on frames and fabrics, while shorter periods may apply to wheels and hardware. Consider the company's customer service reputation when selecting a model, as prompt issue resolution can be crucial during travel disruptions. 


## FAQ


### What types of Samsonite luggage are available, and what sizes are offered?

Common sizes include 20", 24", 28", and 32" spins, as well as comparable wheeled suitcases. Backpacks vary in capacity from 16" to 32" high. 


### What are the main differences between Samsonite's different luggage lines?

Premium luggage typically offers more advanced features like multiple pockets, built-in organization systems, and reinforced corners. Mid-range and budget options still provide plenty of practical features at a lower cost. 


### How should I clean and maintain my Samsonite luggage?

Most Samsonite luggage can be cleaned with a damp cloth and mild soap. For stubborn stains, use a soft brush and baking soda. Avoid harsh chemicals, bleach, and abrasive materials which can damage the surface. 

Store luggage in a dry environment away from direct sunlight and heat sources. Use dust covers and regularly inspect zippers and wheels for proper maintenance.

Mid-range and budget options still offer decent protection with water-resistant fabrics and sturdy construction. However, they may not perform as well in extreme conditions. 


### How much weight can Samsonite luggage safely carry?

Samsonite recommends the following weight capacities: 20-24" spins - 55 lbs, 28" spin - 66 lbs, 32" spin - 70 lbs, and similarly sized wheeled suitcases. Backpacks typically support up to 70 lbs. 

It's important to note that these weights refer to the luggage itself, not including the contents. Always err on the side of caution when packing heavy items. 


### What warranty coverage do Samsonite products offer?

Most Samsonite products carry a limited lifetime warranty on the frame and wheels, while the outer shell typically has a 10-year warranty. For backpacks, the frame and main panel have a lifetime warranty. 

The warranty covers manufacturing defects and damage that occurs during normal use. However, wear and tear, abuse, and damage from excessive weight are not covered.
