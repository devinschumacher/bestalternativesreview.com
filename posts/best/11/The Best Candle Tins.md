## FAQ

![Candle-Tins-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Candle-Tins-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a candle tin?

A candle tin is a metal container used to hold candles, typically made from tin-plated steel or aluminum. The container provides a durable housing for the wax and wick, while the metal base can double as a decorative element when the candle burns down to its core. 

Candle tins come in various sizes and shapes, from small votives to large tapered containers. The metal construction prevents wobble and provides stability, making them ideal for both indoor and outdoor use. 


### How do candle tins work?

Candle tins function through the process of combustion. When lit, the flame heats the wax, causing it to melt and vaporize. The vaporized wax then reacts with oxygen in the air to produce heat and light, while the metal container helps contain the heat and prevent spillage. 

Most candle tins have a built-in tab that allows you to easily remove the metal lid after the candle has burned down to the base. This design feature enables you to reuse the tin as a decorative container or storage holder. 

![Candle-Tins-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Candle-Tins-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the benefits of using candle tins?

Candle tins offer several advantages. They provide a contained and stable base for candles, preventing tipping and spills. The metal construction also helps to contain heat, reducing the risk of fire hazards. 

Additionally, many candle tins feature decorative designs or finishes, adding aesthetic value to the product. The metal containers often have a weighted base that prevents wobble, making them suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. 


### Are candle tins safe to use?

Candle tins are generally safe when used properly. They prevent wax from spilling onto surfaces and maintain a stable base for the burning candle. However, it's important to follow basic candle safety guidelines, such as keeping candles away from flammable materials and never leaving burning candles unattended. 

The metal construction can get extremely hot during use, so avoid touching the outside of the tin while the candle is burning. Always keep candles in their original tins or on a suitable heat-resistant surface when in use. 

![Candle-Tins-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Candle-Tins-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How should I maintain candle tins?

To maintain candle tins, allow them to cool completely after use before handling. Wipe away any excess wax or soot with a dry cloth. For best results, use the metal container as intended – either as a candle holder or a decorative storage container when empty. 

Avoid placing candle tins in direct sunlight or near heat sources when not in use to prevent warping or damage to the metal. Store tins in a cool, dry place to maintain their appearance and integrity. 


### Can I recycle candle tins?

Many candle tins made from tin-plated steel or aluminum are recyclable, depending on your local recycling program. Check with your municipality or waste management facility to determine if candle tins are accepted in your recycling stream. 

Before recycling, remove any remaining candle wax by placing the tin in the freezer. Once solidified, scrape off the wax and dispose of it properly. The clean metal container can then be placed in your recycling bin according to local guidelines.
