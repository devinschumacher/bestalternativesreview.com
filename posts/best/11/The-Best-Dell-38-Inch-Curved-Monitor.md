## Buyer's Guide

A 38-inch curved monitor from Dell offers an expansive viewing surface with excellent peripheral visibility, crucial for gaming and professional applications. This guide outlines key features and considerations for choosing the right Dell 38-inch curved monitor. 


### Display Specifications

Look for a resolution of at least 4K UHD (3840 x 2160 pixels) with a refresh rate of 144Hz or higher for smooth motion in gaming. Calibratable color accuracy with a color gamut like sRGB or Adobe RGB is essential for professional use. The display should have a high dynamic range (HDR) capability for enhanced contrast and detail. 


### Curvature and Design

While 1800R curvature provides natural eye flow and reduced visual fatigue, check that the bezels are minimal to maximize the usable screen area. The stand should offer multiple height and tilt adjustments, while swivel and pivot capabilities are useful for different viewing angles. Consider models with front-mounted controls for cable management and cleaner desk space. 


### Connecting Options

Ensure the monitor supports DisplayPort and HDMI inputs for connecting multiple devices. USB Type-C is convenient for data transfer and power delivery, while built-in USB ports save desk space. Check if the monitor allows daisy-chain capabilities for connecting additional displays or external graphics cards. 


### Input Latency and Response Time

For gaming, prioritize monitors with ultra-low input latency (under 8ms) and grey-to-grey (GTG) response times of 1ms or less. These specifications minimize input lag and motion blur, improving overall gaming performance. Also, verify that the monitor ships with dedicated gaming modes for enhanced visual settings. 


## FAQ


### What are the primary features of the Dell 38 Inch Curved Monitor?

The Dell 38 Inch Curved Monitor stands out with its expansive 3840 x 1600 resolution, immersive curved design, and Vesa-certified display for wall mounting. It's powered by Intel® Graphics with 12GB of video memory, delivering smooth gaming and multitasking performance. 

The monitor supports AMD FreeSync Premium, eliminating screen tearing and input lag for more fluid gaming experiences. Additional features include HDMI 2.0, DisplayPort 1.4, and USB-C connectivity for versatile I/O options. 


### How does the screen curvature affect the viewing experience?

The 38-inch curved display envelops your view, making text and images appear closer, which can enhance readability and immersion. The curve is specifically optimized for 16:9 aspect ratio content, maintaining correct proportions without distortion. 

For side-by-side comparison, the curvature adds about 1.25 inches of width difference between the extreme left and right edges, which can impact multi-monitor setups or very close viewing distances. 


### What kind of response time and refresh rate can I expect?

The monitor delivers accurate color and consistent picture quality at its native 120Hz refresh rate, ideal for gaming and fast-paced content. The true response time of 4ms GTG ensures there's minimal motion blur during intense scenes. 

For applications requiring higher refresh rates, the monitor supports 60Hz for 4K content and 30Hz for 8K, making it versatile for different types of visual media consumption. 


### Can I use multiple monitors with this display?

Yes, the monitor can function as part of a multi-monitor setup. It supports Display Port 1.4 Multi-Stream Technology (MST), allowing you to daisy-chain up to six displays off a single port. Alternatively, you can connect it to a single computer using Display Port or HDMI 2.0 for maximum resolution. 

For configuration, you can set it to clone your primary display or extend your desktop across both monitors. The setup is straightforward through the Display settings in Windows or macOS, with the monitor automatically detecting connected displays. 


### What are the connection options and requirements?

The monitor offers extensive connectivity with DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI 2.0, and USB-C ports. It requires a dedicated graphics card supporting DisplayPort output to enable its full capabilities. USB-C also enables power delivery and video output. 

Power requirements are standard, with the monitor drawing from your graphics card's power or a USB-C power adapter. USB-C connections can power compatible devices like USB 3.0 drives and smartphones for versatile charging and data transfer. 


### How does the stand affect monitor positioning?

The built-in stand offers limited adjustment, with 100mm height adjustment, 35mm tilt, and 100mm swivel capabilities. The stand can mount the monitor up to 232mm away from the wall, providing basic desk flexibility. 

For more advanced positioning, consider third-party arms that offer additional height adjustment and multi-angle swivel capabilities. Wall-mounting via the Vesa-compatible base provides another option for custom desk setup.
