## Buyer's Guide

Gisou Hair Oil combines traditional Middle Eastern botanicals with modern hair care technology to promote healthy, shiny tresses. Understanding its key ingredients and usage guidelines will help you make an informed choice about whether it's right for your hair type and concerns. 


### Key Ingredients

Ingredients like Rosehip Oil, Pomegranate Seed Oil, and Chamomile Flower Oil work together to nourish and protect hair. Rosehip Oil provides essential fatty acids for healthy scalp and hair growth, while Pomegranate Seed Oil helps repair damaged hair strands. Chamomile Flower Oil soothes the scalp and reduces inflammation. 


### Formulation Considerations

The oil's consistency affects how easily it applies and absorbs. Thinner oils spread more readily but may evaporate faster, while thicker oils offer better staying power. The presence of additional ingredients like vitamin E or jojoba oil can enhance its moisturizing and protective properties. 


### Usage Frequency

Application frequency depends on your hair type and routine. Daily use is beneficial for dry or damaged hair, while oily scalps might prefer every other day. Combining it with other treatments like heat protection or protein masks can help address specific hair concerns. 


### Storage and Shelf Life

Proper storage is crucial to maintaining the oil's effectiveness. Keep it in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight to prevent oxidation. Most high-quality hair oils maintain their potency for 6-12 months when stored correctly. Regularly check for changes in color or odor before use. 


## FAQ


### What are the main ingredients in Gisou Hair Oil?

Our hair oil blends organic argan oil, jojoba oil, and a proprietary blend of essential oils extracted from rare, hand-picked botanicals. This trio works synergistically to moisturize, repair, and nourish damaged hair. 

Key active ingredients include argan oil's squalene content, which deeply conditions and strengthens hair, and jojoba oil's similar composition to scalp sebum, allowing for effective penetration and absorption. 


### How should I use Gisou Hair Oil?

Apply 3-4 drops to damp hair, focusing on the mid-lengths to ends. Comb through with your fingers or a wide-toothed comb to ensure even distribution. For best results, cover your hair with a shower cap or plastic bag and leave it on for 30 minutes to an hour before washing out with your regular shampoo. 

If you have fine or oily hair, use once or twice weekly. For dry or damaged hair, application can be daily or every other day until the hair returns to its natural texture. 


### How long does a bottle of Gisou Hair Oil last?

Each bottle contains enough hair oil to treat approximately 20-30 applications, depending on your hair length and density. With daily use, a 50ml bottle typically lasts 4-6 weeks. 

To extend the life of your oil, store it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. The oil has a shelf life of 6 months from the date of opening. 


### What type of container does Gisou use for their hair oil?

The hair oil comes in an 8ml glass vial with a fine-mist sprayer. Each bottle contains 50ml of oil, allowing for precise application while minimizing waste. 

The glass vial and sprayer mechanism help maintain the oil's potency and prevent oxidation, ensuring the product remainsfresh and effective throughout its shelf life. 


### Is Gisou Hair Oil suitable for all hair types?

Our hair oil is appropriate for all hair types, including normal, dry, damaged, and colored hair. The combination of argan and jojoba oils is gentle enough for fine or fine-to-medium hair while effective on thicker, more rebellious locks. 

Avoid use on hair that has recently been treated with extreme heat styling tools or harsh chemicals, as the oil may make these effects more pronounced. If you have significant hair damage or very fine hair, start with 2-3 drops instead of the full 3-4 recommended. 


### Can I use Gisou Hair Oil with other hair products?

Yes, the hair oil blends seamlessly with most other hair products. Apply the oil before your regular shampoo or conditioner for maximum effectiveness. If you use heat styling tools, wait 30 minutes after applying the oil to allow it to fully absorb into your hair. 

The oil works well with styling products like mousse, hair cream, or serum, but apply the oil first to ensure proper penetration and conditioning. Consult the instructions on any additional products you're using to determine the best application order.
