## Buyer's Guide

Skeleton zip up hoodies combine comfort with a distinctive design element. These hoodies feature a zippered front and an open-back design with cut-out detailing, typically creating a visible spine and ribcage outline. The style emerged from rave culture but has since become popular in various subcultures. 


### Key Features

The most crucial aspects of a skeleton hoodie include the hoodie design, fabric quality, and craftsmanship. Look for durable materials that can handle regular wear while maintaining their shape. The hoodie should have a reliable zipper that opens and closes smoothly, even after multiple washes. 

Care instructions are also important, as they dictate how well the hoodie will maintain its shape and color over time. High-quality options may include reinforced stitching at stress points and detailed back designs that maintain their integrity through regular wear. 


### Care and Maintenance

These hoodies often require special care to preserve their unique aesthetic. Some key points include washing them inside out to protect the design and avoiding bleach, which can damage the fabric. Turning them inside out also prevents the design from snagging on other garments during storage or washing. 

When buying, consider the return policy if you're unsure about sizing or color since these items may be more challenging to match with other pieces in your wardrobe. 


### Sizing and Fit

Skeleton hoodies often run true to size, but the back design can affect fit. Consider your comfort level with tight-fitting tops when selecting a size. For a looser fit, consider sizing up, keeping in mind that the back cutout will remain the same size regardless of the overall fit. 

Try on different styles to determine which back design you prefer. Some people find certain designs more flattering or comfortable than others, despite the uniform cutout appearance. 


### Style Considerations

Pairing a skeleton hoodie with the right accessories can enhance its impact. Avoid mixing contrasting styles (e. g. , a fitted sweater under the hoodie) unless you're intentional about creating a specific look. The hoodie's texture and weight will influence how it pairs with other garments, so consider your layering needs when selecting one. 

Some people choose to wear the hoodie with the back design completely concealed, while others prefer to show it off. Consider how you want to wear the hoodie and choose one that aligns with your styling goals.
