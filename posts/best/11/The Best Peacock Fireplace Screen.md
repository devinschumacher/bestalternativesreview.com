## Buyer's Guide

A peacock fireplace screen adds beauty and functionality to any living space, combining natural elegance with practical design. When selecting the right screen for your fireplace, consider several key factors to ensure you choose a piece that matches both your aesthetic preferences and practical needs. 


### Size and Dimensions

The screen's size should complement the dimensions of your fireplace while providing adequate visual appeal. Measure the fireplace's opening and the desired screen location to determine the appropriate width and height. Keep in mind that screens typically extend a few inches beyond the fireplace's edges to create a clean frame around the fire. 


### MATERIAL and Finishes

Materials like metal, glass, and wood offer distinct advantages. Metal screens provide robust construction and come in beautiful finishes. Glass options offer transparency and modern appeal, though they may require more regular cleaning. Wood screens add warmth and natural texture but need periodic maintenance to prevent moisture damage. 


### Decorative Elements

Look for screens with peacock motifs that strike a balance between ornate detail and clean lines. Consider elements like hand-painted feathers, carved profiles, or etched glass patterns. The decorative elements should enhance the room's existing style while maintaining a refined appearance. 


### Installation and Placement

Calculate the screen's weight and frame material to determine if additional support is needed. Proper placement ensures the screen frames the fireplace effectively without obstructing the view. Consider how the screen will look from different vantage points and whether it will complement surrounding furniture and decor. 


## FAQ


### What is a peacock fireplace screen?

A peacock fireplace screen blends practicality with elegant decor, protecting your furnishings from heat and ash while adding a touch of opulence to your living space. These screens typically feature a rich blue backdrop with intricate silver or gold detailing that resembles a peacock's tail feathers, though some may contain actual peacock feathers. 

Modern screens often incorporate fire-resistant materials like tempered glass or metal mesh, with some even featuring concealed storage for remote controls or game controllers. They come in various heights and styles to suit different chimney configurations and room designs. 


### How do you measure for a peacock fireplace screen?

To measure for a peacock fireplace screen, you'll need to consider both the screen's height and width. Measure the vertical distance from the floor to the top of your mantel or hearth, then add a few inches for the screen's base plate. For the width, measure the opening between your chimney breast and the wall, ensuring the screen's sides will sit flush on the mantel. 

Most screens include measurements on their packaging or website, so double-check these to ensure they fit your specific fireplace opening. Always account for your mantel's depth and the screen's frame when calculating the final dimensions. 


### What materials are peacock fireplace screens made of?

Peacock fireplace screens are crafted from a variety of materials that combine aesthetics with functionality. Traditional screens often feature tempered glass encased in metal frames, while modern designs may incorporate wire-mesh constructions that offer superior airflow and visibility. 

For added refinement, many screens include elements like polished nickel, bronze, or gold-plated metalwork that mimics peacock feather detail. Some premium models incorporate actual peacock feathers mounted on a frame, though these require special care and may not be suitable for all environments. 


### How do you maintain a peacock fireplace screen?

Basic maintenance for a peacock fireplace screen includes dusting the surface regularly with a soft cloth and cleaning the screen's inner frame with mild soap and water when needed. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials that can damage the screen's finish or coating. 

If your screen features glass or metal mesh, check for any signs of damage or wear, especially after the initial installation. For screens with feather elements, keep them away from direct heat sources and dust them regularly to preserve their condition. 


### Where should you place a peacock fireplace screen?

Peacock fireplace screens are ideal for both living rooms and dens where large-screen viewing is common. Place the screen in front of your television to create a defined viewing area while maintaining a natural flow in the room. The screen's base should sit slightly above the television's bottom edge to create proper viewing angles. 

Consider the room's overall layout and traffic patterns when positioning the screen. It should be placed in a way that allows easy access to the television and ensures clear visibility across the viewing area. Avoid positioning the screen directly in doorways to prevent traffic restrictions. 


### What warranties do peacock fireplace screens offer?

Most peacock fireplace screens come with warranties that protect against manufacturing defects and material failure. Basic warranties typically cover one to two years and provide options for parts replacement or repair. Premium models may offer extended warranties lasting three to five years, often including labor costs for installation and maintenance. 

When selecting a screen, review the warranty terms carefully to understand coverage scope. Some manufacturers exclude damage from misuse or accidental damage, so clarify what's covered before purchasing. Consider purchasing an extended warranty for additional peace of mind, especially if you're buying a more expensive model.
