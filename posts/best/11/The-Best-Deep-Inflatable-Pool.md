### [Intex 120" x 72" Deep Inflatable Pool](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Deep+Inflatable+Pool?utm\_term=intex-120-x-72-deep-inflatable-pool)

![Intex 120" x 72" Deep Inflatable Pool | Image](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcS77moLB4ZVTsCEaG6HojugX-rjY6JZ5Sn9rMFZlRhFDSRq8K4&usqp=CAY)

This blue inflatable pool lives up to its sizeable 120" by 72" footprint, though its double-wall construction feels a bit fragile for the price point. The 3.05m x 1.83m inflation job takes just 20 minutes with a compressor, and while the 56cm height might disappoint taller swimmers, it's perfect for casual lounging or filling your yard with cool water on a hot day. The included repair patch is a nice touch, but you'll want to check for leaks before diving in.

Unroll this backyard gem on your lawn or deck, and you've got a refreshing 130-inch by 72-inch splash pad that holds up to eight people. The dual-chamber design keeps it stable and puncture-free, so you're not scrambling to fix leaks during your summer barbecues. The best part? It fills up in just 3 to 4 minutes with the included pump, giving you instant relaxation at poolside.

## Buyer's Guide

Deep inflatable pools combine the convenience of an air-filled structure with the luxury of a permanent pool, offering a balance of portability and immersion. These pools range from small backyard installations to large social gathering spots, making them suitable for various spaces and occasions. 


### Size and Capacity

Consider the available space and the number of users when selecting a pool size. Depth typically ranges from 2 to 4 feet, with capacities from 1,000 to 20,000 gallons. Deeper pools provide more comfortable swimming experiences but require proportionally larger spaces. 


### Material and Durability

The pool's main material is usually PVC or TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane). Higher-quality pools feature thicker walls and better seam construction. Look for UV protection, puncture resistance, and a generous warranty period to ensure longevity. 


### Setup and Maintenance

Most deep inflatable pools require a flat concrete or packed dirt surface for setup. The placement should be away from trees and shrubs to prevent damage. Regular maintenance includes checking the pool's pressure, cleaning the water, and inspecting the frame and walls for wear. 


### Additional Features

Higher-end models offer features like built-in ladders, overflow drainage, and ground anchors for stability. Solar blankets and water filtration systems can enhance both hygiene and energy efficiency. Consider accessories like pool heaters, lights, and portable pumps for extended use. 


## FAQ


### What makes a deep inflatable pool different from a standard inflatable pool?

Deep inflatable pools feature deeper water configurations, often between 48-60 inches, compared to standard pools which typically range between 24-48 inches. This increased depth allows for more comfortable floating and basic water activities while providing a safer environment for young children. 

The deeper design requires specific attention to pool stability and water resistance. Manufacturers incorporate reinforced materials and enhanced construction techniques to ensure these pools maintain their shape and integrity under pressure. 


### Can a deep inflatable pool be used for swimming?

While deep inflatable pools offer more depth for floating and simple water activities, their primary design focus is on safety and comfort rather than formal swimming capabilities. The recommended depth and structure don't typically provide the necessary stability and length for proper swimming. 

However, some deep pools include features like extended sides or connected modules that can increase usable space, making rudimentary swimming possible for smaller children or shallow water exercises. 


### What maintenance is required for a deep inflatable pool?

Regular maintenance includes weekly cleaning of the pool interior, checking and tightening of zippers and flaps, and ensuring all seams are secure. The pump filter needs to be cleaned every 2-3 days to maintain water clarity. 

After each use, the pool should be fully deflated and stored in a cool, dry place to prevent damage from heat and UV exposure. The inflatable material should be inspected monthly for signs of wear or damage. 


### How long do deep inflatable pools typically last?

With proper care, deep inflatable pools can last 2-4 years. Factors affecting longevity include storage conditions, use frequency, and adherence to regular maintenance schedules. 

Manufacturers often recommend replacing inflatable material every 3-5 years to maintain optimal water resistance and durability, regardless of visible wear. 


### What are the main advantages of deep inflatable pools?

The primary benefits include increased safety for young children due to deeper water, more comfortable floating experiences, and enhanced privacy when set up in a backyard or pool area. They also take up less space than traditional above-ground pools while providing similar depth. 

These pools typically require fewer maintenance steps than concrete or fiberglass options, making them more convenient for seasonal use or smaller yards. 


### Are deep inflatable pools suitable for all weather conditions?

Most deep inflatable pools perform well in temperatures between 45-85Â°F (7-29Â°C). In colder climates, owners may need to invest in heating equipment or use the pool during warmer months only. 

Exposure to direct sunlight can cause material degradation, so pools should be moved to shaded areas during peak sun hours and stored in a cool place when not in use. Severe weather conditions like heavy rain or high winds should be avoided when the pool is set up.
