## Buyer's Guide

Chebe butter is a traditional East African spread made from fermented milk solids. It's similar to ghee but with distinct flavor nuances and cooking properties. Understanding its characteristics will help you choose the right variety for your culinary needs. 


### Flavor Profile

Chebe butter develops a rich, nutty flavor during fermentation that deepens when cooked. The texture becomes creamy and spreadable. Some varieties develop slight acidity, which can enhance certain dishes but may be undesirable in others. 


### Purity and Processing

Look for products made from pure milk with no additives. Some commercial versions may contain stabilizers or preservatives. The processing method affects texture and shelf life, with artisanal versions often having a shorter shelf life due to natural preservation methods. 


### Storage

Unopened chebe butter should keep at room temperature for several weeks. Once opened, refrigeration is necessary. The spreadable consistency depends on temperature; it may become firm at cooler temperatures and soften at room temperature. 


### Cooking and Serving

Chebe butter pairs well with vegetables, grains, and meats. Its distinct flavor works best as a finishing ingredient rather than a cooking medium. Some varieties can be substituted for ghee but may require adjusting cooking times due to moisture content differences.
