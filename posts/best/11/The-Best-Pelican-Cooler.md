## Buyer's Guide

Pelican coolers are known for their rugged durability and excellent temperature retention, making them a popular choice for outdoor enthusiasts. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the right Pelican cooler for your needs. 


### Size and Capacity

Choose a cooler based on your storage requirements, considering both internal volume and external dimensions. Common sizes range from small 10-quart models for backpacking to large 150-quart versions for road trips. Remember to factor in insulation thickness when comparing capacities. 


### Insulation and Temperature Control

High-quality foam insulation and weather-resistant construction are crucial for maintaining optimal temperatures. Look for coolers with double-wall construction and premium insulation materials like polyurethane. The number of pounds of ice a cooler can hold per cubic foot indicates its ice retention capabilities. 


### Portability and Accessories

Depending on your usage, features like durable wheels, comfortable handles, and drain valves can significantly impact usability. Many Pelican coolers come with optional accessories like ice retention bags, thermal sleeves, and carry cases, which can enhance functionality and protect your investment. 


### Materials and Durability

Pelican coolers are made from impact-resistant materials like polycarbonate, which offers superior scratch resistance compared to traditional plastic. The construction quality, including seam sealing and edge protection, determines the cooler's longevity and ability to resist dents and cracks. 


## FAQ


### What type of gel packs are included with Pelican coolers?

Pelican coolers typically include a set of reusable gel packs. These packs are made from food-grade materials and feature a soft, conforming shape that helps maintain cold temperatures for an extended period. The gel packs are reusable and can be refilled with water to maintain their cooling capacity. 

Depending on the model, Pelican coolers may include 1-4 gel packs. Some models offer the option to purchase additional gel packs separately, allowing users to maintain optimal cooling capacity for their specific needs. 


### What temperature range can Pelican coolers maintain?

Pelican coolers are designed to maintain temperatures between 32°F and 41°F (0°C and 5°C), which is ideal for keeping perishable items fresh. The cooling capacity is affected by several factors, including the size of the cooler, the number of gel packs used, and the amount of food and drink stored. 

When properly insulated and filled with frozen gel packs, a Pelican cooler can maintain these temperatures for 3-5 days without re-freezing, depending on external conditions and the frequency of opening the lid. 


### How long do Pelican gel packs maintain cold temperatures?

When placed in a Pelican cooler and allowed to completely freeze, the included gel packs maintain cold temperatures for 3-5 days. The actual duration depends on external temperatures and the frequency of opening the cooler's lid. 

Once the gel packs begin to thaw, their cooling capacity decreases. Users should monitor the temperature of both the cooler and the gel packs to ensure that food and drink remain safely below 40°F (4°C). 


### What's the difference between Pelican coolers and insulated bags?

Pelican coolers are specifically designed for extended cold storage, featuring a rigid polycarbonate construction that provides superior insulation and protection compared to standard insulated bags. The rigid structure also allows for better organization and stacking of multiple coolers. 

Insulated bags, while effective for short-term storage, are not as durable or weather-resistant as Pelican coolers. They typically lack the rigid structure needed for maintaining consistent cold temperatures during transportation or extended storage. 


### Can Pelican coolers be used for non-food items?

Pelican coolers are primarily designed for food storage and are not recommended for use with certain items, particularly those that could damage the gel packs or the cooler's interior. However, they can be used for: - Pharmaceuticals and medical supplies

- Personal care items (with proper sealing)

- Documents that require cold storage

- Beverages and snacks for outdoor activities

Always ensure that any non-food items are properly sealed to prevent leakage and maintain the integrity of the cooler's contents. 

For maximum efficiency and safety, it's best to use Pelican coolers for their intended purpose - food storage - to maintain optimal temperature control and prevent potential cross-contamination. 


### How should I clean and maintain a Pelican cooler?

To maintain hygiene and extend the life of your Pelican cooler, regularly clean it with mild soap and water. For stubborn stains, you can use a light bleach solution, but avoid using harsh chemicals that could damage the polycarbonate material. 

Always allow the cooler to completely air dry before refilling with gel packs or food items. Regular maintenance of the gel packs (washing and proper storage when not in use) helps maintain their efficiency and the overall performance of the cooler.
