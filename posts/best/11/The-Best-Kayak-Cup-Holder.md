Apply a small amount of lubricating oil to the moving parts every few months to keep the mechanism smooth and prevent corrosion, especially in saltwater environments. 


### What factors should influence your choice of cup holder?

Consider the size and shape of your water bottle, as some holders have specific dimensions to accommodate popular bottle sizes while others are adjustable. The mounting point on your kayak should also influence your choice. 

Evaluate the weight capacity of the holder, especially if you plan to carry heavier bottles, and look for features like quick-release mechanisms for easy bottle removal. The ease of installation and the brand's reputation for durability and quality are also important factors.
