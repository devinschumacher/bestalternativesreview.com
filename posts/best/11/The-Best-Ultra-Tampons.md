## Buyer's Guide

Ultra tampons offer enhanced protection for heavy flow days and active lifestyles. These tampons feature extended absorbency layers and stay-in-place designs to handle menstrual flow effectively. Understanding their key features will help you find the right product for your needs. 


### Extended Absorbency Layers

Ultra tampons incorporate additional absorbent material in their core structure. This design allows them to hold more blood than standard tampons, providing reliable protection for heavy flow days or nighttime use. The extra absorbency is achieved through specialized materials that can retain more liquid while maintaining comfort and breathability. 

![Ultra-Tampons-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Ultra-Tampons-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Stays-In-Place Technology

Modern ultra tampons often include innovative designs that prevent movement within the vaginal canal. These features can include winged tampon designs, additional adhesive layers, or modified core configurations that reduce shifting. The primary goal is to maintain consistent protection and reduce the need for frequent changes, particularly during physical activities. 


### Silicone Wings and Adhesives

Many ultra tampons incorporate silicone wings that grip the vaginal walls, helping to keep the tampon in place. Some brands also use adhesives at the base of the tampon to create a more secure seal. While these features improve retention, they may not be suitable for all users, especially those who prefer natural absorption or are sensitive to certain materials. 

![Ultra-Tampons-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Ultra-Tampons-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Material Considerations

Ultra tampons are typically made from highly absorbent materials like rayon and cotton. Some premium brands incorporate wood cellulose or bamboo fibers to enhance absorption without compromising comfort. The tampon wrapper often includes information about its material composition and whether it contains hypoallergenic ingredients suitable for sensitive skin. 


## FAQ

![Ultra-Tampons-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Ultra-Tampons-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What makes ultra tampons different from regular tampons?

Ultra tampons are designed to absorb more menstrual fluid than regular tampons, making them suitable for heavier flow days or extended wear between changes. Their absorbency typically ranges from 12 to 18 grams, compared to 8-12 grams for regular tampons. 

These tampons often feature extra-absorbent core technology and wider wings for enhanced leakage protection. They may also include features like superfine cotton and advanced moisture-wicking to provide better comfort during extended use. 


### Are ultra tampons safe for daily use?

Ultra tampons are safe for daily use when following proper insertion and removal techniques. It's important to change tampons every 4-6 hours to prevent bacteria growth and reduce the risk of TSS (Toxic Shock Syndrome). 

Regularly rotate between different absorbency levels based on your flow to prevent over-absorption, which can increase the risk of TSS. Always wash your hands before and after tampon use. 

![Ultra-Tampons-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Ultra-Tampons-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What's the difference between ultra tampons and night-time tampons?

Ultra tampons are suitable for both day and night use, while night-time tampons are typically the thickest absorbency available. The main difference is convenience - night-time tampons usually come with longer strings for easier removal while sleeping. 

Ultra tampons may have slightly shorter strings for everyday use and come in standard applicator sizes. Both types provide overnight protection, but night-time tampons are specifically designed for extended wear without frequent changes. 


### Can I use an ultra tampon for 12 hours straight?

Most menstrual hygiene experts recommend changing tampons every 4-6 hours, even ultra-absorbent ones. Using a tampon for 12 continuous hours increases the risk of TSS and can lead to discomfort and leakage. 

If you're planning an extended activity or travel, consider bringing spare tampons and pads. Always listen to your body and change tampons if you notice heavy leakage or discomfort. 

![Ultra-Tampons-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Ultra-Tampons-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What should I do if I insert an ultra tampon too far?

If you feel discomfort or experience difficult insertion, stop immediately and clean your hands. Retrying without proper technique can increase the risk of injury. Most ultra tampons sit at the base of the cervix, which is about 2-3 inches inside the vagina. 

For proper insertion, push the tampon in gently until you feel resistance, then rotate and push in another 1/4 inch. If you continue to experience issues, consider trying a different tampon size or style that fits your body better. 


### How do I know if an ultra tampon is the right size?

Ultra tampons come in standard sizes that correspond to their absorbency level. The applicator size typically ranges from small to extra-large, matching the tampon's absorbency. Most brands offer size charts based on flow patterns and body measurements. 

Starting with the thinnest size that absorbs your flow comfortably is recommended. If you frequently need to change tampons before the next scheduled time, consider trying a larger size. Always follow the manufacturer's guidelines for proper fit and comfort.
