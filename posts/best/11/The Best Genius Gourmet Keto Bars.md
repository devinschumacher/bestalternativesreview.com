## Buyer's Guide

When choosing keto-friendly snacks, look for products with less than 2g of net carbs per serving and at least 2g of fiber to help regulate blood sugar. The bar's nutritional profile should also include healthy fats and proteins to keep you satiated between meals. 


### High-Quality Protein Source

Lean proteins from sources like egg whites, collagen, or pork peptides can help maintain muscle mass while following a ketogenic diet. Avoid bars containing artificial protein isolates or fillers that deviate from natural protein sources.

### Healthy Fat Content

Focus on bars that prioritize healthy fats from sources like MCT oil, nuts, or seeds. These fats provide sustained energy and keep you feeling full longer compared to products heavy in processed oils or saturated fats. 


### Low Net Carbs

The ketogenic diet emphasizes keeping net carbs (total carbs minus fiber) under 20-50g per day. Choose bars with net carbs below this range and high fiber content to support ketosis while maintaining satiety.

### Whole Food Ingredients

High-quality keto bars use whole food ingredients like nuts, seeds, and natural sweeteners rather than artificial additives. Review the ingredient list for recognizable foods and avoid products containing artificial sweeteners or sugar alcohols.
