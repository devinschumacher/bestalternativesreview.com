## Buyer's Guide

Roces skates combine style and functionality, making them a popular choice for both beginners and experienced rollers. When selecting Roces skates, consider several key factors to find the perfect pair for your needs. 


### Build Quality and Materials

Invest in skates with robust construction, featuring durable materials like premium vegan leather or synthetic overlays. The boot should have reinforced stitching and stiff uppers for support, while flexible ankles allow for natural movement. High-quality wheels and bearings ensure smooth rolling and reliable performance. 


### Fit and Comfort

A proper fit is crucial for comfort and performance. The boot width should match your foot, with slight room for movement. The tongue and collar should sit comfortably against your leg without constricting. Consider lacing systems that allow customization for different foot shapes and arch support needs. 


### Wheel Selection

Wheels range from 52mm to 70mm, with larger sizes offering more roll and smaller ones providing quicker turns. For smooth surfaces, opt for 54mm to 60mm wheels. If you'll be skating on rougher terrain or need better acceleration, go with 52mm or smaller. Harder wheels (78a-80a) deliver faster rolls but less grip, while softer ones (81a-85a) provide more traction but reduce speed. 


### Additional Features

Look for skates with good ankle support, especially if you're new to roller skating. Durable hardware like 8mm axles and brake mounts prevent wear and extend skate life. Some models include padded heel cups or instep straps for extra support. Consider skates with quick-release buckles for easy entry and exit. 


## FAQ


### What makes Roces skates different from other brands?

Roces has established itself through innovation in roller sport equipment, particularly in professional competitions. Their skates often feature specialized designs for specific disciplines, with a strong focus on durability and performance. 

The brand's commitment to quality is evident in their intricate build process and attention to detail, sets them apart from mass-market options. 


### How should I size my Roces skates?

Roces recommends measuring your foot and comparing it to their sizing chart, which is available on their official website. They typically run slightly smaller than standard sizing, so it's best to measure and refer to their specific recommendations. 

If you're between sizes or have a unique foot shape, ordering a half size larger can provide better comfort and performance. 


### Are Roces skates suitable for beginners?

While Roces offers entry-level options, their professional designs may not be ideal for complete beginners. Their advanced features and specialized construction might be overwhelming for those new to roller sports. 

Beginners might want to consider a more user-friendly brand that offers clear instructions and basic setups until they develop their skills. 


### What maintenance do Roces skates require?

Regular maintenance includes checking the bearings, lubricating the wheels, and ensuring the laces remain well-tied. The trucks and hardware should be tightened periodically to maintain proper performance. 

After each use, wipe down the deck and wheels with a clean cloth to remove any debris or moisture. This basic care can extend the life of your Roces skates significantly. 


### Can I customize Roces skates?

Roces does allow limited customization options, such as changing screws and adding grip tape. However, their designs are highly engineered, and modifications may void warranties or affect performance. 

For significant changes, Roces offers several optional components through their accessories line, which can enhance functionality without altering the original design. 


### Are Roces skates worth the investment?

Roces skates represent a significant financial investment, but they offer high-quality construction and specialized features that can enhance performance. They're particularly valuable for serious competitors looking to maximize their edge in professional events. 

While they may be more expensive than basic options, the durability and performance benefits often justify the higher cost for dedicated roller sports enthusiasts.
