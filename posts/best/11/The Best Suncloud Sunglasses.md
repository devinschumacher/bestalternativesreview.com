## FAQ


### What makes Suncloud sunglasses different from other brands?

Suncloud sunglasses stand out through their unique blend of Scandinavian design aesthetics and practical sun protection features. Unlike many mass-produced sunglasses, Suncloud combines durable, hypoallergenic T3â„¢ frames with polarized lenses that reduce glare and enhance color perception. 

Their proprietary T3â„¢ frame material is 100% recyclable and offers superior flexibility and durability compared to traditional metal or plastic frames, making them ideal for active lifestyles. 


### Are Suncloud sunglasses safe for children?

Most Suncloud sunglasses models feature UV400 protection and meet international safety standards for eyewear, making them suitable for children over 3 years old. The brand recommends checking the specific product's safety rating before purchasing for younger children. 

Parents should look for models with secure nose and temple adjustments to prevent accidental loss or misplacement during play. 


### How do I care for my Suncloud sunglasses?

Regular maintenance keeps your Suncloud sunglasses looking their best. Use a soft, lint-free cloth to wipe the lenses and frame daily. For deeper cleaning, use mild soap and warm water, avoiding harsh chemicals that can damage the T3â„¢ material. 

Always store your sunglasses in the protective case provided, keeping them away from extreme temperatures and direct sunlight when not in use. 


### Can I get prescription lenses for my Suncloud frames?

Suncloud offers both ready-to-wear and prescription options. Most frame styles are available in ready-to-wear form, while others can accommodate prescription lenses through their in-house optical services. 

For prescription lenses, order the frame size you normally wear and choose between clear or tinted lenses depending on your prescription needs and outdoor conditions. 


### How do Suncloud lenses compare to competitors?

Suncloud lenses typically offer similar UV protection to competitors but excel in reducing glare through their polarized coating. They're thicker than some premium competitors' lenses but provide better scratch resistance due to their hardened coating. 

The cost of Suncloud lenses falls between budget-friendly UV protection and premium sports optics, making them a practical choice for active wearers who value durability. 


### What is the return policy for Suncloud sunglasses?

Suncloud offers a 30-day satisfaction guarantee for all purchases. Within this timeframe, you can return or exchange most products in their original condition with proof of purchase.
