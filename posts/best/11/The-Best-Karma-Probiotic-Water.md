## FAQ


### What exactly is probiotic water?

Probiotic water is spring water enriched with beneficial bacteria (probiotics) that support gut health. This natural drink option provides live cultures that aid digestion and boost the immune system. 

Each bottle of Karma Probiotic Water contains live Lactobacillus casei bacteria, ensuring you get 1 billion CFUs (Colony Forming Units) per 14.1-ounce serving. 


### How is Karma Probiotic Water different from regular water?

While regular water simply hydrates, Karma Probiotic Water offers a gut-friendly boost. The live probiotic cultures promote a healthy balance of bacteria in your digestive system. 

The water undergoes natural filtration through volcanic rock and charcoal, adding mineral content while maintaining its refreshing purity. 


### Should I refrigerate Karma Probiotic Water?

Yes, we recommend refrigerating Karma Probiotic Water to preserve the freshness and enhance its naturally crisp taste. Probiotics remain active but may slightly decline in effectiveness at room temperature. 

Refrigeration helps maintain the water's clarity and prevents sedimentation of any potential precipitate that might form. 


### Are the probiotics in Karma Probiotic Water dairy-free?

Yes, the probiotics in Karma Probiotic Water are derived from Lactobacillus casei, a non-dairy source that's safe for most dietary preferences. 

This makes it suitable for individuals following dairy-free or vegan diets, as well as those with dairy sensitivity or lactose intolerance. 


### How long can I store Karma Probiotic Water?

Once opened, you should consume Karma Probiotic Water within 14 days. Keep the bottle refrigerated after opening to maintain both quality and the live culture's effectiveness. 

The water remains safe unopened for 30 days from the production date, making it convenient for those who purchase cases or larger quantities. 


### Who should avoid Karma Probiotic Water?

While generally safe, individuals with severe immunodeficiency or compromised immune systems should consult a doctor before consuming probiotics. 

Those undergoing chemotherapy or with active gastrointestinal infections might need medical guidance before adding probiotics to their diet.
