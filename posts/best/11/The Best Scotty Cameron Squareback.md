## Buyer's Guide

Scotty Cameron's Squareback line has revolutionized putting with its innovative design and exceptional performance. These putters feature a distinctive wide-sole design with square-backed hosels, offering precise stability and consistent square-face impact. Understanding the key aspects of Squareback putters will help you select the right model for your stroke and improve your putting accuracy. 


### Design Fundamentals

These putters incorporate a wide stainless steel sole with a square-backed hosel design. The square backing provides increased stability by preventing the face from twisting during the stroke. The wide sole helps prevent unwanted gliding while maintaining solid contact with the ball. The combination of these elements creates a putting experience that promotes a straight-back/straight-through stroke pattern. 


### Weight Distribution

Scotty Cameron's Squareback models utilize precise weight distribution to optimize center of gravity (CG) positioning. The perimeter weighting in the sole of each putter helps reduce blade movement during the stroke, making it easier to maintain square contact with the ball. The CG placement affects the putter's responsiveness to impact and its ability to resist twisting, with mid-to-high CG models suitable for a variety of stroke speeds. 


### Face Design

The square face design is a hallmark of these putters, promoting a consistent striking surface and preventing face twist at impact. The square face is complemented by a shallow grooved back for added face stability. Some models feature milling patterns that refine the face design, while others maintain a smooth surface for various player preferences. The face design significantly influences ball roll and control, with deeper grooves generally providing more consistent roll. 


### Stroke Compatibility

Selecting the right Squareback model depends on your specific stroke characteristics. Players with a moderate-to-fast stroke should consider models with higher moment of inertia (MOI) for stability, while those with a slower stroke may prefer lighter options with similar face design. The grip style and shaft length compatibility also affect stroke execution, with square-backs typically requiring a slightly longer grip extension to maintain proper hand positioning. 


## FAQ


### What is the Scotty Cameron Squareback putter?

The Scotty Cameron Squareback putter features a distinctive square-shaped hosel that defines its appearance. This design element, combined with an offset face, helps golfers align their addresses and improve their stance. 

Available in various lengths and designs, the Squareback series includes both mallet and blade models to suit different playing styles and preferences. 


### What materials are used in Squareback putters?

Scotty Cameron Squareback putters are crafted from stainless steel, with some models incorporating proprietary soft-touch coatings for increased grip. 

The metal elements are precision-milled for consistency, while the shafts accommodate both standard and alternative options for customization. 


### How does the Squareback design influence alignment?

The square hosel design helps golfers maintain proper posture at address by naturally aligning their hands and arms in the correct position. 

The offset face encourages an open-grip posture without requiring an awkward stance, making it particularly beneficial for players with shorter club lengths. 


### Are Squareback putters suitable for all golfers?

While the design works well for many golfers, particularly those with longer arms or shorter torsos, it may not be ideal for all body types. 

Scotty Cameron recommends fitting sessions to determine if the Squareback design aligns with your specific stroke mechanics and comfort level. 


### What maintenance requirements do Squareback putters have?

Regular cleaning and polishing maintain the cosmetic appearance and prevent corrosion. The soft-touch coating can be refreshed with appropriate maintenance products. 

Checking and adjusting the lie angle and face angle periodically ensures optimal performance and alignment assistance remains effective. 


### How do Squareback putters perform on different surfaces?

The stainless steel construction and precision-milled surfaces provide consistent roll on various surfaces, from smooth greens to slightly faster conditions. 

While the design helps with alignment, golfers should still practice on different surfaces to develop a consistent stroke across various playing conditions.
