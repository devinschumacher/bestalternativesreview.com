## Buyer's Guide

Womens board shorts are designed to provide essential protection and performance while swimming or surfing. These shorts combine durable fabrics with strategic mesh panels for ventilation, ensuring both comfort and sun protection during active outdoor activities. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the right pair for your specific needs and preferences. 


### Fit and Size

Board shorts typically come in three main styles: brief, regular, and long. Brief styles are closest to the body and most form-fitting, ideal for high-intensity activities where movement is unrestricted. Regular cut offers more coverage and is suitable for both casual and competitive use. Long board shorts provide maximum protection and are often preferred for cooler temperatures or extended sessions in the water. Consider your body type and intended use when selecting the proper fit.

### Material and Construction

High-quality board shorts feature reinforced stitching at stress points, elastic waistbands with adjustable drawstrings, and secure pockets for storing essentials. The main fabric should be made from quick-drying, moisture-wicking materials such as spandex blends or polyester. These materials resist odor and maintain shape, even after multiple washes. The shorts may include water-resistant linings, protective leg ruffles, or reinforced knees for enhanced durability during active use. 


### Mobility and Comfort

Key elements for mobility include flexible panels, strategic mesh ventilation, and padding options. Look for shorts with stretchy panels in high-motion areas like the thighs and hips. Mesh panels under the arms and in the back provide vital airflow while maintaining coverage. Padded shorts offer increased comfort during surf sessions, with padding often concentrated in sit bones and hip areas. Compression options can help prevent chafing during long sessions.

### Protection and Features

Most board shorts include UPF ( Ultraviolet Protection Factor) rating systems to block harmful UV rays, with higher ratings offering greater sun protection. Consider shorts with additional protective features like waterproof phone pouches, built-in swim trunks, or quick-release closures for easy removal. Reflective elements can improve visibility during early morning or evening sessions. The outer lining material should resist chlorine and saltwater damage, extending the life of your shorts and maintaining their performance capabilities. 


## FAQ

![Womens-Board-Shorts-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Womens-Board-Shorts-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What makes board shorts suitable for women?

Women's board shorts are designed with specific features that enhance comfort and performance during water activities. They often include four-way stretch fabrics for flexibility, quick-drying materials to stay dry, and moisture-wicking properties to prevent chafing. 

The high waist and longer length provide better coverage than traditional swimming trunks, helping to prevent irritation from chlorine or saltwater. Many models also feature strategic mesh panels for ventilation and secure pockets for essentials. 


### Are board shorts too restrictive for surf lessons?

Modern board shorts strike a balance between compression and freedom of movement, making them suitable for surf lessons. The compression helps maintain shape and minimize bulk in the water. 

Look for models with slightly looser fits through the legs and thighs to allow for natural leg movement during paddleboarding and surfing lessons. Avoid overly tight shorts that restrict circulation or mobility.

### How do I measure for the right size?

Measure around your natural waist (loose clothing), and compare that measurement to the waist size chart on the board short's website. Allow about 1-2 inches of extra room for comfort during water activities. 

Check the length measurement for both inseam and outseam. Inseam length is crucial for proper coverage when sitting or performing water sports. Most women's shorts range from 28-34 inches in inseam length. 


### What materials are most resistant to chlorine damage?

Board shorts featuring recycled polyester, spandex blends, or technical fabrics specifically designed for water sports show the least chlorine damage. These materials maintain their color and shape even after repeated exposure to pool chemicals. 

Avoid cotton or pure polyester options, which tend to fade, pill, and lose their shape more quickly in pool environments. Consider short-term storage solutions like dark, sealed bags to protect your shorts between uses.

### Can you wear board shorts under a wetsuit?

Board shorts make ideal undergarments for wetsuits, providing additional warmth and protection against sun exposure. Their quick-drying properties prevent moisture buildup between layers during cold water activities. 

Ensure the board shorts fit well beneath your wetsuit to prevent cold water from seeping between them. Consider thin, moisture-wicking inner shorts to absorb any excess moisture and improve comfort during extended water sessions. 


### What color options are most practical for daily wear?

Black, navy, and dark blue remain popular choices for board shorts due to their chlorine resistance and versatility in pool environments. These colors also offer the least visibility in murky water conditions. 

If you prefer brighter colors, consider short-term use in warm water environments where chlorine damage is less of a concern. Always check if the manufacturer offers colorfastness guarantees before purchasing bright or pastel shades.
