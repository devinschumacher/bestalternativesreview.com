## Buyer's Guide

A power steering stop leak kit from Lucas is designed to address leaks in vehicle power steering systems, typically caused by worn or damaged seals and hoses. These kits are particularly useful for quick repairs that allow you to maintain your vehicle's steering functionality until a more permanent repair can be performed. 


### Key Components

The typical Lucas power steering stop leak kit includes a silicone-based sealant concentrate, a precision applicator gun, and detailed instructions. The sealant is specifically formulated to stop leaks by creating a flexible, long-lasting seal without the need for extensive mechanical work. 


### Application Process

The application process requires precise technique to ensure effective sealing. Begin by bleeding air from the power steering pump reservoir to remove any existing air bubbles. Using the applicator gun, inject the sealant directly into the leaking component while the system is pressurized. The instructions typically recommend applying the sealant in a specific pattern around the leak to optimize the sealing properties. 


### Safety Considerations

Safety is paramount when working with power steering systems, which contain hydraulic fluid under pressure. Always jack the vehicle and place it on wheel chocks before beginning work. Ensure the vehicle is stable and the wheels are turned away from obstacles. Additionally, wear appropriate protective gear such as gloves and safety glasses to prevent injury from splashing fluids. 


### Evaluation of Success

After applying the sealant, allow the system to come to temperature to ensure the sealant has time to cure properly. Rebuild the system according to manufacturer specifications and bleed the pump reservoir to remove any remaining air. Test the power steering system thoroughly for leaks by operating the steering at various speeds and angles. If the leak persists, the underlying issue may require more extensive repair beyond the capabilities of a stop leak kit.
