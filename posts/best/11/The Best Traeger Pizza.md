This Red Baron frozen pizza packs a flavorful punch with its crispy brick oven crust and hefty toppings of sausage, green and red peppers, pepperoni, and onions.

## Buyer's Guide

Whether you're a pizza enthusiast looking to make homemade pies or an outdoor cook exploring new recipes, a Traeger pizza setup can transform your grill into a versatile cooking tool. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you choose the right equipment and techniques for delicious results. 


### Grill Compatibility

Traeger grills are known for their precision temperature control, making them suitable for baking pizzas. Look for models with raised cooking surfaces and enough space for a pizza stone or baking steel, as these can help achieve the ideal cooking surface. The grill's size should also match your pizza-making needs - smaller grills work well for single pizzas, while larger ones can accommodate multiple pies or larger stones. 


### Preparation Equipment

Making pizza on a Traeger requires specific preparation tools. Invest in a pizza peel with a heat-resistant handle for safely transferring pizzas to and from the grill. A quality pizza stone or baking steel distributes heat evenly and creates a crispy base. Consider a domed pizza oven cover to maintain temperature during baking. 


### Temperature Control

Accurate temperature control is crucial for pizza baking on a Traeger grill. The ideal cooking range is between 450° and 500°F (232°-260°C). Many Traeger models feature precise temperature control features that help maintain consistent heat. Monitor the temperature regularly and adjust fans or vents as needed to achieve optimal baking conditions. 


### Cooking Techniques

Proper technique ensures even cooking and crispy results. Start by preheating the grill and baking surface to the desired temperature. Lightly dust the baking surface with cornmeal to prevent sticking. Assemble your pizza on a standard pizza peel with the toppings, then carefully slide it onto the preheated surface. Bake for 10-15 minutes, rotating the pizza halfway through for even cooking. The crust should be golden brown and the toppings cooked through. 


## FAQ


### What makes Traeger's approach to pizza different?

Traeger's pizza cookery system uses indirect heat and wood-fired technology to create a unique wood-smoked flavor that traditional ovens can't match. The pizza skin comes out crispier and has a distinct smoky character that's characteristic of their method. 

Unlike conventional pizza cookers that rely solely on direct heat, Traeger's use of convection and indirect cooking creates an evenly heated environment that prevents burning while developing a fantastic crust texture. 


### Can any Traeger model be used for pizza?

While all Traeger grills can technically be adapted for pizza, their most popular pizza-specific models are the Traeger Pro Series 6200 and 6500. These versions come with built-in pizza stones and cooking racks optimized for their pizza-making capabilities. 

The more affordable Traeger Ironwood Series and Pellet Grills can also be used for pizza with proper accessories, but the dedicated Pro models offer superior performance and convenience. 


### How long does it take to cook a Traeger pizza?

A typical homemade pizza cooks in about 15-20 minutes at 450-500°F with the Traeger's cooking system. The exact time depends on the thickness of the crust and toppings, as well as your desired level of browning. 

Preheating the grill properly (15-20 minutes at 200-250°F) ensures consistent cooking and optimal wood-smoke flavor development, which contributes to the overall cooking time. 


### What type of wood should I use for Traeger pizza?

Maple wood is particularly popular for pizza because of its mild flavor that doesn't overwhelm the toppings. Applewood and cherry wood also work well, offering slightly sweeter notes. Avoid using woods with strong flavors like mesquite or hickory, as they can overpower the pizza's taste. 

If you choose hardwood pellets, look for blends specifically formulated for pizza cooking, as they're designed to produce the right balance of heat and smoke. 


### How should I prepare the pizza crust for Traeger cooking?

For the best results, use a pre-baked pizza crust or create one by rolling out dough on a lightly floured surface, shaping it into a 12-inch round, and letting it rest at room temperature for 30 minutes before cooking. 

Preheat the Traeger to 500°F with the pizza stone in place. Once preheated, place the pizza on the stone and cook for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly. 


### Can I use Traeger pizza accessories with other Traeger models?

The pizza stone and cooking rack systems are designed to work with specific Traeger models, particularly the Pro Series 6200 and 6500. While you can use the stone in other grills, the cooking rack might need to be adjusted or modified for compatibility with different models. 

Always consult your specific model's manual to ensure proper accessory usage and grill setup, as even minor differences between models can affect performance and cooking results.
