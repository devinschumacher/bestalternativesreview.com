## Buyer's Guide

Soda Stream machines offer an eco-friendly alternative to store-bought sodas, allowing you to carbonate your own water at home. Consider your carbonation needs, available space, and budget when selecting the right model. 


### Carbonation Needs

Determine how much carbonated water you'll use regularly. Basic models produce up to 5 gallons per bottle, while premium models offer larger capacities. Consider if you need multiple dispensers for different flavored waters or just a single unit for basic carbonation. 

![Soda-Stream-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Soda-Stream-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Available Space

Compare the machine's dimensions with your storage space. Most countertop models measure 11.5 inches wide, 14.1 inches deep, and 16 inches tall. Compact models are available for smaller spaces, while larger models with built-in storage require more room. 


### Budget

Set a budget that covers the machine's purchase price and potential maintenance costs. Entry-level models start around $60 and offer basic carbonation features. Mid-range models cost between $150-250 and include additional features like built-in storage or premium dispensers. High-end models range from $300-500 and provide professional-grade performance with advanced flavoring options.

### Maintenance Requirements

Regular maintenance affects both operation and longevity. Basic models require monthly descaling, while premium models may need quarterly maintenance. Consider the time and effort required for each model's maintenance schedule. Some advanced models feature automatic maintenance reminders or self-cleaning functions to simplify upkeep. 


## FAQ

![Soda-Stream-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Soda-Stream-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a Soda Stream?

A Soda Stream is a countertop appliance that makes sparkling water by mixing carbon dioxide with regular water. It's an alternative to buying bottled sodas, offering a way to create homemade sparkling drinks on demand. 

The system consists of an aluminum canister that stores carbon dioxide, a water tank, and a soda maker that combines these two elements to create sparkling water. You can carbonate water to make soda, infused water with fruit flavors, or even sparkling kombucha and beer. 


### How does it work?

Carbon dioxide from the canister is injected into tap water using the Soda Stream aerator. This process creates dissolved CO2, which forms bubbles in the water. The resulting carbonated water flows through the spout and into your glass. 

You can adjust the amount of carbonation by controlling the flow of CO2 into the water stream. The Soda Stream app offers customization options, allowing you to select your preferred level of fizziness. 

![Soda-Stream-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Soda-Stream-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How much does it cost to operate?

The initial cost of a Soda Stream system ranges from $100 to $200, depending on the model and retailer. Operating costs are minimal, primarily consisting of replacement CO2 cylinders, which cost between $25 and $35 per fill. 

A single CO2 cylinder provides enough carbonation for approximately 150 liters of sparkling water, making it cost-effective in the long run. The total cost per liter of carbonated water is less than 17 cents when calculated over 150 liters. 


### What can I carbonate with a Soda Stream?

Primarily, Soda Stream is used to carbonate tap water, instantly creating sparkling water. This can be personalized with various flavors, including still water with fruit slices, herbs, and carbonated water. 

The system can also carbonate seltzer water, which is already carbonated. By mixing different flavored seltzers with fruit or herbs, you can create unique, homemade sparkling mixtures. 

![Soda-Stream-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Soda-Stream-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do I maintain my Soda Stream?

The Soda Stream system requires regular cleaning to maintain proper functionality and hygiene. After each use, remove the aerator and clean it with warm water and mild dish soap. Rinse thoroughly and allow it to air dry completely. 

Every three months, replace the carbon filter to maintain water quality and improve taste. The carbon filter removes impurities that could affect the flavor of your carbonated water. 


### What are the benefits of using a Soda Stream?

Soda Stream offers significant cost savings compared to purchasing bottled sodas, reducing plastic waste associated with single-use bottles. It provides fresh, customizable sparkling water without artificial preservatives. 

The ability to carbonate water at home supports reduced sugar consumption, as homemade carbonated water eliminates the added sugars found in most commercial sodas. The system also reduces household waste and energy consumption compared to refrigerator storage of bottled drinks.
