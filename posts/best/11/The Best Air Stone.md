An air stone that's supposed to add a wall of dancing bubbles to your aquarium, but it's such a unreliable piece of junk that it's broken in half twice - once while taking it out of the package and again when trying to attach it to the tank. The few reviewers who actually got it to work say it's terrible at its job, only producing half the bubbles it's supposed to. If you're looking for something to aerate your water, you'd be better off getting a bubble wand instead.

## Buyer's Guide

Air stones are essential components in aquariums and ponds, providing crucial aeration for both water and aquatic life. This guide helps you understand the key factors to consider when selecting an air stone, ensuring optimal water oxygenation and performance. 


### Aeration Requirements

Calculate your tank's total volume to determine proper air stone size. As a general rule, a 3-inch air stone can aerate up to 150 gallons of water. Consider whether your tank has specific oxygen needs based on fish species, plant density, or filtration system requirements. 


### Performance and Durability

Look for air stones made from surgical-grade silicone or borosilicate glass, as these materials resist cracking and maintain consistent airflow. The stone's design affects performance; pleated or folded designs typically offer better oxygen transfer than simple spheres. 


### Installation and Setup

Ensure your air stone connects easily to your air pump's output tube using compatible adapters. Consider the stone's mounting options - some designs include hangers, while others may need additional securing mechanisms. The positioning of the stone affects air bubble distribution; placed near water returns or filter outlets optimizes oxygen dispersion. 


### Maintenance and Cleaning

Regular cleaning is crucial for maintaining airflow and preventing biofilm buildup. Most air stones require monthly cleaning with freshwater. Softer materials like silicone are easier to clean but may degrade faster. More robust glass stones maintain their shape longer but need thorough cleaning to prevent mineral deposits. 


## FAQ


### What is an air stone?

Air stones are small, porous stones that efficiently diffuse air from an aquarium air pump into the water, creating bubbles that increase oxygen levels and create beautiful visual effects in your tank. 

Their porous design maximizes surface area for gas exchange, making them a practical choice for both small and large aquariums. They're available in various sizes and shapes to suit different tank setups. 


### How does an air stone work?

When connected to an aquarium air pump, an air stone generates small bubbles as air passes through its porous structure. These bubbles rise to the surface, releasing oxygen into the water and creating gentle water movement. 

The increased water circulation helps distribute oxygen and benefits tank inhabitants, while the aesthetic bubble display adds visual appeal to your aquarium. 


### What size air stone should I use?

The appropriate size depends on your tank's volume and filtration system. As a general guideline, use 1 air stone per 10-20 gallons of water. Larger stones are suitable for larger tanks or when your filtration system cannot handle multiple smaller stones. 

Consider your tank's height and flow rate when determining the right size. You'll want the bubbles to rise visibly, but not so fast that they create disruptive currents. 


### How long should an air stone run?

Most air stones should run continuously, as they help maintain proper oxygen levels in the water and provide beneficial water movement. Some advanced systems or specific fish species might require adjustments, but basic setups benefit from constant operation. 

If you notice your air stone stopping or producing fewer bubbles, it may need cleaning. Regular maintenance, such as weekly inspection and gentle cleaning, ensures optimal performance. 


### Which materials are air stones made from?

Air stones are typically made from ceramic, plastic, glass, or lava rock materials. Ceramic stones are the most common, offering good durability and cost-effectiveness. Plastic stones are lighter and more flexible, while glass and lava rock provide unique visual appeal but may be more expensive. 

The material affects durability, cleaning requirements, and visual appearance. Ceramic stones maintain their shape well and resist mineral buildup. Plastic stones are the most economical option. Glass and lava rock stones offer elegant visual effects but need more careful cleaning. 


### How do I clean an air stone?

Clean your air stone weekly using room temperature water. Avoid harsh chemicals or high-pressure tools, as these can damage the stone's porous structure. For stubborn mineral buildup, you can soak the stone overnight in white vinegar before rinsing thoroughly. 

When cleaning, hold the stone under running water to remove any debris. Avoid letting it sit upside down, as this can trap air and prevent proper cleaning. Regular cleaning ensures optimal performance and prolongs the stone's lifespan.
