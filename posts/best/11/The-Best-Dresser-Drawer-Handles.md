## Buyer's Guide

Dresser drawer handles transform functional storage into stylish accessories, making the right choice crucial for your wardrobe essentials. Understanding the key aspects of drawer hardware helps you select handles that enhance both the aesthetic and practical aspects of your dressing experience. 


### Mounting Compatibility

Drawer handles attach through the face of the drawer front or slide into channel strips along the top and bottom edges. Face-mounting options hide screws for a sleek look, while side-mounting designs offer more grip but expose hardware. 


### Metering System and Size

Measuring from the top to bottom edge of the drawer helps determine handle height. Common lengths range from 2 to 3 inches, with longer handles providing better leverage for heavier items. The width between handles depends on drawer size, typically 2-3 inches apart for smaller drawers, increasing with drawer length. 


### Material and Finish Options

Drawer handles come in metal, plastic, and wood, with metals like brass, chrome, and stainless steel offering the most durability and luster options. Consider finishes that complement your existing furniture while resisting scratches and discoloration. 


### Installation Requirements and Tools

Basic tools like a drill, screwdriver, and level are needed for installation. Pre-drilling guides prevent wood splitting, and using appropriate fasteners ensures secure mounting. Refer to manufacturer instructions for specific requirements and recommended hardware. 


## FAQ


### What is the difference between traditional and contemporary handles?

Traditional drawer handles often feature classic designs with ornate details, while contemporary handles tend to be simpler and more minimalistic. Traditional handles work well with classic and vintage furniture styles, while contemporary handles complement modern and sleek designs. 

Traditional handles typically require more space than contemporary ones, so consider your drawer depth when making your selection. Contemporary handles are available in both single and double pull options, offering more versatility in mounting location. 


### How do I measure for dresser drawer handles?

Measure the inside length of your drawer before selecting a handle size. This ensures the handle will fit properly without being too small or too large for your space. 

For single-pull handles, measure from the center of the handle to either end. Double-pull handles require twice this measurement, as they attach at both ends of the drawer. 


### What materials are dresser drawer handles made from?

Common materials include stainless steel, brass, nickel, chrome, and matte black finishes. Each material has different durability and maintenance requirements, so consider your lifestyle and cleaning habits when choosing. 

Stainless steel and brass handles offer excellent durability but may require regular cleaning. Chrome and nickel handles resist tarnishing but show fingerprints more easily. 


### How do I install dresser drawer handles?

Installation typically requires drilling holes in your drawer faces and attaching the handles with screws. Basic tools like a drill, screwdriver, and measuring tape are needed for this process. 

Ensure the drill bit matches your screw size and use protective eyewear during installation. If you're not comfortable with DIY projects, consider professional installation for added security. 


### What's the difference between surface-mount and full-extension handles?

Surface-mount handles attach directly to the drawer face and open to approximately 90 degrees. They're ideal for dressers and nightstands where space is limited. 

Full-extension handles extend the drawer entirely and allow 180-degree opening. They provide more accessibility but need adequate clearance under the drawer for proper function. 


### How do I care for dresser drawer handles?

Clean handles regularly using a soft cloth and mild soap to remove finger prints and dust. Avoid harsh chemicals that may damage the surface finish. 

Check screws periodically to ensure they remain tight. Loose screws can damage the handle or allow it to come off completely if not addressed promptly.
