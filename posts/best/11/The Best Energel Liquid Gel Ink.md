## FAQ


### What makes Energel Liquid Gel Ink unique?

Energel Liquid Gel Ink combines the flowability of liquid ink with the smooth writing experience of gel ink. The proprietary formula produces vibrant colors with minimal bleed-through on most paper types. 

The ink dries quickly, prevents feathering, and offers excellent water resistance. Its fine tip design provides consistent line widths, making it ideal for both everyday writing and artistic projects. 


### Can Energel ink work in any pen?

While Energel ink is compatible with most fountain pens and gel pens, it's recommended to use it specifically with pens designed for liquid gel ink. Using it in pens not optimized for the formula may cause clogging or reduced performance. 

Always check the pen manufacturer's guidelines for ink compatibility before switching to a new ink type. 


### How does Energel ink compare to traditional gel ink?

Energel ink maintains the smooth flow and color intensity of traditional gel ink while offering better resistance to smudging and water damage. Its liquid consistency allows for smoother application, especially in finer nib pens. 

Regular gel inks may dry out more quickly in fountain pens due to their thicker consistency, while Energel's balanced formula provides consistent performance across various writing instruments. 


### What paper types work best with Energel ink?

Energel ink performs exceptionally well on standard printer paper and notebooking paper. It also works well on thicker cardstock and quality writing paper. The ink's water resistance makes it suitable for archival storage and presentations. 

Avoid using it on extremely thick or coated papers without testing first, as these may affect the ink's appearance or performance. 


### Are refill bottles available for Energel ink?

Energel offers refill bottles in several sizes to extend your supply. The bottles come with precision-fit nozzles for both pen and bottle compatibility, ensuring controlled ink flow during refilling. 

Check the manufacturer's website for compatible bottle sizes and nozzle types to match your current writing instruments. 


### How should I store Energel ink?

Store Energel ink bottles upright in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Proper storage prevents evaporation and maintains ink viscosity for optimal performance. 

If not using the pen daily, remove the ink cartridge or bottle and install a fresh pen cartridge to prevent potential oxidation or drying of the ink inside the pen.
