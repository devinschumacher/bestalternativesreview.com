## Buyer's Guide

A wall oven microwave combo combines cooking efficiency with convenient microwave functions, perfect for both new homes and kitchen renovations. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the right appliance for your cooking needs. 


### Capacity and Dimensions

Size matters when choosing a wall oven microwave combo. The standard dimensions are 24 inches wide, 30 inches tall, and 24 inches deep. Consider your kitchen's available space and how much food you typically cook when determining the appropriate size. 


### Cooking Features

Wall oven microwave combos offer various cooking options. Essential features include self-cleaning function, convection cooking, and rack arrangement flexibility. The microwave should provide versatile defrosting options and precise temperature control for baking. 


### Energy Efficiency

Look for appliances with good energy ratings to save on utility costs. The Department of Energy's EnergyGuide label indicates annual energy consumption, helping you compare similar models. Consider features like automatic shut-off and power-saving modes to further reduce energy use. 


### Installation and Safety

Proper installation is crucial for both functionality and safety. Ensure the wall can support the appliance's weight, typically ranging from 60 to 100 pounds.

## FAQ


### What is a wall oven microwave combo?

A wall oven microwave combo features both a conventional wall oven and a built-in microwave side by side. This compact appliance combines cooking versatility with space-saving design, offering conventional baking options alongside microwave functionality. 

These units are common in kitchens where countertop space is limited, as they maximize functionality while maintaining a relatively low profile. They're particularly popular in apartments, smaller homes, or kitchen renovations where storage space is at a premium. 


### What are the key features of wall oven microwave combos?

Most wall oven microwave combos include features like convection cooking, self-cleaning, and multiple baking modes for versatility. The microwave portion usually offers standard defrost, reheat, and cook functions with power levels and presets for common tasks. 

These appliances often include digital controls, LED display screens, and interior lighting to help monitor cooking progress. Some models also feature convenient features like bottom shelf cooking and delayed start options. 


### How do wall oven microwave combos compare in terms of cooking performance?

Wall oven microwave combos generally perform well for microwave tasks and provide decent convection baking capabilities. The conventional oven tends to have less capacity than standalone wall ovens but offers more controlled cooking options. 

While professional results may not match standalone appliances, these combos excel at providing a practical balance of features for everyday cooking needs. The convection element helps improve browning and crisping compared to traditional microwave cooking. 


### What are the installation requirements for wall oven microwave combos?

Installation typically requires a dedicated vent hood and proper electrical connections, similar to a standard wall oven. The space above the unit should be clear of obstacles, and there needs to be adequate clearance for door opening and food placement. 

Some models come with specific installation templates and guides. It's essential to verify measurements and ensure proper ventilation, especially when the unit includes self-cleaning features. 


### How do wall oven microwave combos affect kitchen workflow?

These appliances can streamline kitchen tasks by keeping cooking and heating functions in one unit, which can reduce the number of appliances needed. The microwave portion allows quick reheating of meals while the conventional oven handles main course cooking. 

However, simultaneous use of both cooking elements may not be possible on all models. The layout and countertop organization should be considered to maintain efficient kitchen workflow. 


### What maintenance requirements do wall oven microwave combos have?

Regular cleaning of both cooking elements is recommended, including wiping down the interior of the microwave and oven surfaces. The self-cleaning feature simplifies oven maintenance but should be used according to the manufacturer's instructions. 

Keep the door seals clean and replace any faulty seals promptly to maintain energy efficiency. Monitor the condition of the microwave turntable and oven racks, and replace them if necessary to ensure proper functionality.
