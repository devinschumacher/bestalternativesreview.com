## Buyer's Guide

Defiant door knobs transform everyday entries into striking focal points through bold designs and premium materials. While these distinctive hardware pieces add visual impact, their quality and functionality vary significantly. This guide helps you select durable, secure, and stylish knobs that enhance your space. 


### Material Quality and Durability

Premium materials like solid brass, stainless steel, and nickel-plated brass resist wear and maintain their finish longer. Solid brass knobs offer exceptional durability but require regular maintenance. Stainless steel provides lasting shine with minimal upkeep. Look for 316 grade stainless steel for superior corrosion resistance in all environments.

### Security Features

Enhanced security isn't just for deadbolts. High-quality door knobs incorporate anti-pry designs and hidden pins. Look for models with concealed pin mechanisms that prevent forced entry attempts. The backplate design is crucial - choose thick plates with multiple fixing points for maximum security. 


### Installation Requirements

Standard door knob sizes require 2-inch holes, but check specific dimensions. Some designs need larger openings. Verify the doorknob's weight capacity matches your door thickness and material. For hollow-core doors, consider surface-mount options or consult a professional installer.

### Style and Coordination

Select knobs that match your architectural style and room's color scheme. Consider the overall height and diameter for proper scale. Multi-groove designs allow easier installation in existing door holes. For coordinated sets, measure your existing hardware or specify your current style preference.
