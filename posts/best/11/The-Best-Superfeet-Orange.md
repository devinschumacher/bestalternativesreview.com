These unisex insoles hit the sweet spot with just 3mm of cushioning, thanks to their flexible Heel cradle that helps keep your foot in the optimal position. The AeroSpring Foam does a great job of absorbing shock without adding bulk, and the built-in odor control keeps your feet fresh during long days on your feet. The beveled edge design makes them easy to trim for a custom fit, while the moisture-wicking layer helps prevent those unsightly foot smells.

## Buyer's Guide

The Superfeet Orange is a popular insole option that offers significant cushioning and support. When selecting your insoles, consider several key factors to ensure you choose the right level of arch support and firmness. 


### Arch Support Levels

Superfeet Orange insoles come in various arch support levels: Extra Support, Support, and Light Support. Extra Support provides the most arch support for overpronators or those with flat feet, while Light Support offers minimal arch modification for people with high arches or neutral feet. 


### Material Composition

The foam material in Superfeet Orange insoles is designed to compress under weight while maintaining its shape. This compression helps distribute pressure evenly across the foot, though some may find the material dense and less breathable than alternatives like gel or memory foam. 


### Size and Fit Considerations

These insoles typically have a universal fit that works well in most footwear, but their one-size-fits-all approach may not accommodate very wide feet. Consider purchasing a larger size if you have wide heels or a high arch that needs extra space. 


### Warranty and Return Policy

Superfeet Orange insoles come with a five-year warranty and a 90-day satisfaction guarantee. This policy allows for returns if the product doesn't meet your expectations, giving you time to determine if they provide the comfort and support you need. 


## FAQ


### What makes Superfeet Orange different from regular Superfeet insoles?

Superfeet Orange insoles are designed with a unique blend of materials that provides superior arch support and heel cupping. Unlike regular Superfeet insoles, which are made primarily from polyurethane, Orange insoles incorporate a proprietary blend that helps stabilize the foot while promoting natural movement. 

The orange color is a visual indicator that these insoles contain a higher concentration of shock-absorbing materials, particularly in the heel area. This design addresses common foot pain issues by reducing stress on the ball of the foot and heel. 


### Are these insoles suitable for all types of footwear?

Superfeet Orange insoles can be used in most types of footwear, including shoes, boots, and certain athletic footwear. However, they are not recommended for high-impact sports like running or jumping, where specialized orthotic insoles might be more appropriate. 

For best results, it's important to choose insoles that match your specific footwear. These insoles work well in dress shoes, casual footwear, and some athletic shoes, but may need to be combined with additional arch supports for very high-top boots or specific sports footwear. 


### How long do these insoles typically last?

Superfeet Orange insoles are designed to last between 6-12 months with regular use, depending on factors like activity level, weight, and footwear type. Proper care, including regular cleaning and storage in a dry place, can extend their lifespan. 

It's recommended to check the insoles for wear patterns every 6 months. If you notice significant compression in the arch support or heel cupping, it's time to replace them to maintain proper foot health and support. 


### Can these insoles be worn with an existing orthotic device?

Superfeet Orange insoles are not designed to be worn directly with other orthotic devices. Their built-in heel cup and arch support make them suitable as a primary insole solution. However, they can be used in conjunction with over-the-counter orthotic inserts, provided the total height of both does not exceed 20mm to maintain proper footwear fit and function. 

If you currently wear custom orthotics or have specific foot conditions, it's advisable to consult with a podiatrist or foot specialist before adding these insoles to your footwear. 


### Are these insoles suitable for people with diabetes or other foot conditions?

Individuals with diabetes or other foot conditions should consult with their healthcare provider before using any new footwear inserts. While Superfeet Orange insoles are designed for comfort and support, they may not be appropriate for all conditions. 

People with diabetes, neuropathy, or other foot conditions should prioritize inserts specifically designed for their condition. These insoles often provide more precise arch support and pressure distribution, which is crucial for maintaining foot health in individuals with existing conditions. 


### How should I clean and maintain these insoles?

Clean Superfeet Orange insoles regularly using mild soap and warm water. Avoid harsh chemicals or bleach, which can damage the material. Rinse thoroughly and allow to air dry completely before reusing. 

Store insoles in a dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture. If you notice any signs of wear, compression, or damage, replace them promptly to maintain proper foot support and prevent discomfort.
