## FAQ


### What is the Brio water dispenser?

The Brio water dispenser is an advanced hydration solution that combines style with functionality. It features a modern design while delivering versatile water temperature options - hot, cold, or room temperature - making it suitable for various occasions from home use to office spaces. 

Designed for both convenience and efficiency, the Brio dispenser includes features like automatic shut-off and clear water level indicators. It's constructed with durable materials to ensure longevity while maintaining a sleek profile that complements any setting. 


### How does the Brio water dispenser work?

Water is added to the dispenser through its convenient fill port. The system then maintains a consistent water temperature based on the selection (hot, cold, or room temperature), thanks to its built-in heating and cooling elements. When a user selects the desired temperature, the system delivers clean, filtered water from one of its four available cups. 

The dispenser automatically cycles through a cleaning process at regular intervals to ensure the water remains fresh and the machine operates efficiently. It also includes a backup power supply to prevent thermal runaway in case of power interruptions. 


### What are the temperature options?

The Brio water dispenser offers three distinct temperature settings: hot, cold, and room temperature. This versatility allows users to customize their drinking experience based on their needs or preferences. The hot setting delivers steam-free, warm water, while the cold setting provides ice-free chilled water for immediate consumption or use in beverages. 

The room temperature setting maintains water at ambient temperature, ideal for maintaining the natural taste of sparkling water or for those who prefer their water at slightly elevated temperatures without the need for heating. 


### Can the Brio dispense sparkling water?

The Brio water dispenser is designed to dispense both still and sparkling water. To maintain carbonation in sparkling water, users should fill the dispenser directly with their sparkling water bottles or use the included filter system specifically designed to preserve carbonation. The system can handle bottles ranging from 2-liter to 1.5-liter capacity. 

When dispensing sparkling water, it's important to use the provided filter and avoid heating the water to prevent loss of carbonation. The system can maintain carbonation for several hours, making it suitable for extended use in homes or offices. 


### What maintenance is required?

The Brio water dispenser requires minimal maintenance to keep it operating efficiently. Regularly check the water levels and ensure the machine is filled when the indicator light turns on. Clean the water reservoir and filter system according to the manufacturer's guidelines, typically every three months or as needed based on usage. 

Monitor the water quality and replace the filter when the indicator light changes color, which typically occurs when the filter is nearing its end of life. The internal heating and cooling elements require no direct maintenance, but the system automatically performs cleaning cycles to maintain optimal performance. 


### What is the energy consumption?

The Brio water dispenser operates at an average power consumption of 120 watts when in use, which is comparable to other similar water dispensers in the market. The system uses less power when idle, typically consuming around 10 watts while maintaining water temperature. 

Due to its efficient design and automatic shut-off features, the Brio water dispenser has an estimated annual energy consumption of 109 kWh, which is considered low for its category. This makes it an eco-friendly choice while providing reliable water temperature options.
