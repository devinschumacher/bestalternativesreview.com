## Buyer's Guide

A backyard trampoline can transform summer afternoons into epic adventures, but with so many options available, how do you choose the right one? Our buyer's guide covers essential features to consider, from the jump zone to safety standards, helping you select a trampoline that matches your family's fun level and backyard space. 


### Jump Zone Fundamentals

The jump zone is your trampoline's sweet spot for bouncin'. Look for a design that spreads the pressure evenly across the mat, like those with deeper pockets or optimized frame designs. The mat material should be durable enough for the bounce you crave â€“ think thick, reinforced polyester with UV protection for lasting performance. 


### Safety Standards and Features

Protection comes first with a quality trampoline. The enclosure should snap-tight around the springs and frame, with no gaps where fingers could slip through. Additional safeguards like floor padding, protective corner covers, and safety net attachments can give you peace of mind during playtime. 


### Frame and Spring Quality

A solid frame is the backbone of your backyard rebounder. Aluminum frames offer affordability and corrosion resistance, while steel provides superior strength at a higher price point. Note the spring gauge â€“ thicker springs handle more weight and last longer, though they do increase jump height and intensity. 


### Setup and Space Requirements

Before you flip the first somersault, measure your backyard for proper placement. Aim for at least 15 feet of open space in every direction. Consider the ground type too â€“ concrete or paving stones need specialized footings to prevent settling, while grassy areas may require extra padding under the base plate. 


## FAQ


### What is a 16 trampoline?

A 16 trampoline is a recreationalampoline with a diameter of 16 feet (4.88 meters). The 16 measurement refers to the width of the trampoline frame, excluding the springs and canvas. 

This size falls between standard backyard trampolines (typically 12-14 feet) and larger competition models (18 feet and above). The 16-footer offers a balance of space for fun and performance capabilities for experienced users. 


### What material is the jumping surface made of?

Most 16 trampolines feature a polyester or nylon jumping surface reinforced with heavy-duty stitching. These materials offer durability while maintaining necessary elasticity. 

The surface is typically covered with a UV-resistant coating to protect against sunlight damage and comes with a lifetime warranty against manufacturing defects. 


### How many people can safely use the trampoline at once?

The manufacturer recommends no more than 1 person on the trampoline at a time when performing jumps higher than 12 inches. For trick attempts or competitive use, only 1 person is allowed. 

For casual use and basic jumps, 2-3 people can share the trampoline safely, but this should still be monitored by an adult. Always follow specific weight and usage guidelines provided by the manufacturer. 


### What is the typical weight capacity?

Standard 16 trampolines have a weight capacity of 220-250 pounds per person. The maximum weight capacity is usually published on the product specifications. 

Heavier models may have capacities up to 350 pounds, but these are less common and more expensive. Always check the weight rating before purchasing to ensure it meets your needs. 


### How much space is needed around the trampoline?

A minimum of 15 feet of clear space is recommended around all sides of the trampoline for safety. This allows for buffer zones where falls can occur without hitting obstacles. 

The surface should be completely clear of toys, pet bowls, or other items that could cause injury in the event of a fall. Always anchor the trampoline according to the manufacturer's instructions. 


### What maintenance is required for the trampoline?

Regular maintenance includes checking the frame for rust, tightening loose screws, and inspecting the springs for wear or breakage. The jumping surface should be cleaned weekly to remove dirt and debris. 

The enclosure net should be checked monthly for damage, and the pad covering the springs should be replaced every 2 years. The trampoline should be raised off the ground during winter storage and retracted when not in use.
