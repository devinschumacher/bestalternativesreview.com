The Frye Austin Jodhpur Boot brings a touch of western flair to any outfit with its classic buckle design and chunky heel. Supple leather lines every inch of these comfortable boots, making them perfect for both casual wear and those quiet luxury occasions that call for just the right amount of polish.

Frye's classic Veronica Flex Combat gets a comfort upgrade with Goodyear welt construction and a flexible outsole, though the one-size-fits-most ankle boots can be a tight squeeze to put on. The premium leather upper and luxurious lining make the 1-inch stacked heels more palatable, while the lack of a zipper adds to the challenging getting-on-and-off process.

These Frye Engineer boots combine classic style with lasting durability, featuring premium waxed leather from Chicago's Horween tannery and handmade construction for lasting comfort.
