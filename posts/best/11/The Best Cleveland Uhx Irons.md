## Buyer's Guide

Choosing the right iron set can significantly enhance your golf game by improving consistency and distance. Cleveland's UHX irons represent the brand's latest technology in this category. When selecting your perfect match, consider several key factors to ensure optimal performance and enjoyment on the course. 


### Forging vs. Casting

Understanding the manufacturing process helps you choose based on your swing characteristics and preferences. Forging creates a more uniform grain structure, ideal for players who like a feel similar to muscle-back irons. Casting allows for more precise weight distribution, benefiting players who prefer a lighter, more forgiving iron.

### Loft and Lie Angle

The right combination of loft and lie angle is crucial for accurate ball striking. Measure your current clubs to ensure proper setup, or let a professional fit you. The UHX irons offer a 0.5-degree lower lofter design compared to their predecessors, which some players find benefits their swing. 


### Closure and Gap Wedges

The UHX lineup features distinct closure and gap wedges. The closure wedge has a more aggressive sole design for easier bunker play, while the gap wedge maintains consistent sole width for precise approach shots. Consider your shot-making tendencies when selecting between these options.

### Price Point and Warranty

Evaluating the value proposition involves comparing the UHX iron set's price to its features and build quality. Cleveland's warranty reflects confidence in their product, offering limited lifetime coverage for the UHX irons. Higher price points often correlate with better materials and construction, impacting long-term performance and durability.

![Cleveland-Uhx-Irons-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cleveland-Uhx-Irons-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the key features of the Cleveland UHX irons?

The Cleveland UHX irons incorporate a thin, resilient faced design with a high MOI for enhanced forgiveness and consistent ball-striking. The irons feature a precision-milled face and a urethane-infused cavity back for improved ball control and increased distance. 

The UHX irons come with Cleveland's proprietary Speed Frame construction, which incorporates a thicker frame around the perimeter of the face to increase face flexing during the impact, resulting in higher ball speeds and greater distance. 


### How do the UHX irons differ from previous Cleveland iron models?

The UHX irons represent a significant evolution in Cleveland's iron technology, featuring a thinner face design compared to their traditional cavity-backed models. This modern approach combines traditional urethane-cast internals with a precision-milled face for improved ball speed and consistency. 

Whereas previous models focused on wide, forgiving designs, the UHX irons prioritize a more muscle-back feel with slightly thinner toplines, appealing to players who prefer a more traditional iron appearance and feel.

### Which UHX iron model would be suitable for a high-handicap player?

The UHX 17-7 model is specially designed for higher-handicap players, featuring a more traditional look and feel with increased offset at the leading edge. This design combination helps promote proper impact and consistent ball striking for players who may struggle with the thinner-faced design of some of the Tour models. 

The UHX 17-7 also incorporates Cleveland's urethane-infused cavity back technology for increased forgiveness, making it a more suitable choice for players who benefit from a draw-forging pattern while maintaining a reliable ball flight and distance. 


### Can the UHX irons be customized?

The UHX irons offer extensive customization options through the Cleveland Custom Shop, including lie angle adjustments, shaft selection, and grip options. The irons are available in multiple configurations, allowing players to fine-tune their setup for optimal performance. 

Customization options also extend to the face coating, which can be selected from various options to optimize spin rates and ball flight characteristics based on individual playing style and course conditions.

The UHX irons employ a 17-4 stainless steel construction for the face and frame, combined with a urethane-infused cavity back for improved ball control. The irons feature a precision-milled face design to maximize ball speed, with specific patterns optimized for different iron types (wedges, utility irons, long irons). 

Club specifications include a standard 45-degree lie angle for most players, with face angles ranging from -2° to +5° to accommodate specific ball flight preferences. The irons are available in stock lengths or can be customized to specific height requirements. 


### What is the warranty coverage for the UHX irons?

Cleveland Golf offers a standard two-year warranty on all UHX irons, covering manufacturing defects and ensuring lasting performance. The warranty applies to each iron individually, with replacement or repair provided as needed during the warranty period. 

Players can also opt for Cleveland's extended warranty program, which offers additional protection against certain types of damage (such as impact-related defects) beyond the standard two-year period.
