Pair these cleverly-designed sheets with their mattress protector and you'll have a sleep system that keeps your bed tidy and your partner from stealing your covers all night. The zippered design makes it a breeze to wash your sheets without wrestling with a stubborn mattress - and unlike regular sheets, you can sleep on the top sheet without worrying about it slipping off during the night. While the company needs to work on their shipping practices, the sheets themselves are a game-changer for keeping your bed looking (and feeling) fresh. 


## Buyer's Guide

Choosing the right pillow protector can significantly enhance both the hygiene and comfort of your sleep environment. These protective covers create a barrier between your pillow and any potential allergens, helping to maintain its freshness and extend its lifespan. By understanding the key features and considerations, you can select a pillow protector that meets your specific needs and enhances your sleep quality. 


### Pillow Size Compatibility

The most common pillow sizes are standard (20" x 26"), king (20" x 36"), and queen (20" x 30"). Always measure your pillow and verify the protector's dimensions before purchase. Ensure the protector matches your pillow size exactly to prevent air gaps or uneven protection. 


### Material Quality and Breathability

Pillow protectors come in various materials, each with different properties. Cotton is breathable and hypoallergenic, making it suitable for most sleepers. Microfiber offers superior waterproofing but may be less breathable. Look for protectors with a closed-cell membrane or breathable barrier layer that prevents allergens while allowing air circulation. 


### Seams and Construction

The design of the seams can impact both comfort and protection. Triple-stitched seams provide the best durability and prevent leakage. The closure type (button, zipper, elastic) should be convenient for your pillow size. Enclosed elastic edges at the corners keep the protector firmly in place without bunching. 


### Additional Features

Look for protectors with built-in allergen barriers rated for dust mite prevention (typically 600+ thread count). Some protectors include a top layer of waterproofing and a lower breathable panel. Consider the ease of cleaning and drying when selecting materials and construction. Machine washable designs with quick-dry properties are ideal for regular maintenance. 


## FAQ


### What are my pillow sheets made of?

Our pillow sheets are crafted from premium materials, including 100% Egyptian cotton, percale, and sateen. The Egyptian cotton provides luxurious softness and durability, while percale offers a crisp, breathable texture. Sateen sheets deliver an extra-smooth, lustrous finish that's resistant to wrinkling. 

Each sheet set includes two pillowcases measuring approximately 20 inches by 30 inches, featuring elasticized closures for secure fitting. The sheets are available in a range of thread counts, from 200 to 600, which determines their level of softness and performance. 


### How should I wash my pillow sheets?

Machine washing is recommended for your pillow sheets. Use a gentle cycle and mild detergent to maintain their quality. We suggest washing them weekly or after each use, especially if you share your bed or have pets. 

Avoid using bleach or harsh chemicals, as these can damage the fabric's quality and fade the colors. When drying, tumble dry on low heat or air dry them to maintain their shape and prevent shrinkage. 


### Can I get different colors to match my bedding?

We offer a wide selection of colors to complement your existing bedding. Our pillow cases come in solid colors, prints, and patterns to suit every style preference. Check our color guide to find the perfect match for your bedroom decor. 

Each color option is available in the same thread count and material as our standard pillow cases, ensuring consistent quality throughout your bedding set. 


### What makes your pillow cases hypoallergenic?

Our hypoallergenic pillow cases are made from premium hypoallergenic Egyptian cotton, which reduces the growth of dust mites and other allergens. The percale weave and tight 200-thread count make it difficult for allergens to penetrate the fabric. 

Each set includes special allergy-relief features like elasticized corners and reinforced stitching to prevent allergens from accumulating in crevices. Regular washing with the recommended detergent further helps maintain a hypoallergenic sleep environment. 


### How do I choose the right thread count?

Thread count affects both the comfort and longevity of your pillow sheets. A higher thread count means more threads per square inch, resulting in a softer feel and better durability. Our recommended thread counts range from 200 to 600, with higher counts suitable for those who prioritize extreme softness and extended wear. 

Consider your specific needs: lower thread counts work well for casual use or when you prefer a slightly more breathable sleep surface. Higher thread counts are ideal for frequent washers, those who sleep hot, or individuals with sensitive skin. 


### Will the pillow cases fit standard pillows?

Our pillow cases are designed to fit standard 20-inch by 30-inch pillows, which are the most common size. The elasticized corners ensure a secure fit, preventing the pillow cases from riding up or bunching during the night. 

Each pillow case has a roomy draft shield that allows for optimal head and neck support without restriction. The generous sizing helps maintain the pillow's shape and prevents flattening throughout the night.
