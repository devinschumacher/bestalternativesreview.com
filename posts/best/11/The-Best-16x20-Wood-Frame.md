## Buyer's Guide

A well-constructed 16x20 wood frame serves as the foundation for quality art prints and photos, offering both aesthetic appeal and structural integrity. Understanding the key aspects of wood frame construction helps you select a piece that complements your artwork while lasting for years to come. 


### Frame Construction Quality

The frame's primary components - the stiles (sides), rails (top and bottom), and corners - should be crafted from solid wood rather than composite materials. Look for frames with mortise-and-tenon joinery or traditional picture rail construction, which provide superior strength and stability compared to nailed or glued assemblies. 

![16x20-Wood-Frame-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/16x20-Wood-Frame-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Wood Species and Finish

Common wood species include birch, oak, and cherry, each offering different aesthetics and durability levels. Birch provides an affordable option with a clean, modern appearance, while oak and cherry deliver warmth and rich tones. The finish should protect the wood while preserving its natural character, with lacquer or polyurethane offering good protection without hiding the grain. 


### Machined Edges and Corners

Professional frames feature precision-machined edges and corners, free of rough or chipped surfaces that can damage artwork. While some minor imperfections are acceptable in budget frames, premium options display perfectly straight lines and flush joins throughout the frame's profile. 

![16x20-Wood-Frame-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/16x20-Wood-Frame-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Frame Style and Proportions

For modern or contemporary art, a sleek, minimal frame with subtle molding works best. Traditional pieces often benefit from more decorative frames with pronounced profiles. Consider the frame's width in relation to the artwork's dimensions - general guidelines suggest frame depth should be approximately 1/6 to 1/4 of the print's longest side. 


## FAQ

![16x20-Wood-Frame-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/16x20-Wood-Frame-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What size wood frame am I purchasing?

These frames measure 16 inches in width and 20 inches in height, perfect for display items that are similarly sized or slightly smaller. 

Note that the frame's actual opening size for artwork is approximately 14.5 inches by 18.5 inches, accounting for the frame's border. 


### What materials are used in construction?

The frame is crafted from quality wood, providing durability and an authentic finish. Most frames feature a standard 1-inch depth. 

Some manufacturers offer alternative materials like metal or plastic for specific applications where traditional wood frames might not be suitable. 

![16x20-Wood-Frame-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/16x20-Wood-Frame-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do I measure my artwork for the frame?

Measure the artwork's widest and longest sides to ensure it fits within the frame's opening dimensions. 

Allow space around the edges for proper display; typically, you want the artwork to sit at least 1/2 inch away from all sides of the frame's interior edges. 


### Can these frames be painted or customized?

While most frames maintain their natural wood grain finish, some manufacturers offer pre-painted options in various colors. 

For customization, you can sand and paint the frame yourself, though this requires careful measurement to maintain proper artwork alignment. 

![16x20-Wood-Frame-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/16x20-Wood-Frame-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is the recommended gap between the frame and the artwork?

A gap of 1/8 to 1/4 inch between the frame's interior edges and the artwork helps prevent damage and allows for proper display. 

Ensure the frame has a snug fit for the artwork, preventing shifting or movement during display. 


### How should I clean a wood frame?

Wipe the frame with a slightly damp cloth using mild soap and water, then dry thoroughly to prevent water damage. 

Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners that might damage the wood finish.
