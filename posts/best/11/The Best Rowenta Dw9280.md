## Buyer's Guide

The Rowenta Dw9280 is a popular upright steam iron known for its powerful steam function and reliable performance. As with any steam iron, several key features and considerations can significantly impact your ironing experience. 


### Steam Output

Steam irons typically provide two types of steam: built-in steam and vapor boost. Built-in steam produces continuous steam, while vapor boost delivers bursts of hot air for penetrating tough wrinkles. The Rowenta Dw9280 features a 1,200g/h steam output and a powerful vapor boost, making it effective for all fabrics. 


### Water Capacity and Refilling

Most steam irons operate on a similar principle - water travels from the reservoir through a heating element to produce steam. The Dw9280 has a generous 300ml water tank that provides adequate steam for most ironing sessions without frequent refilling. The tank is easily accessible for quick refills, though some models feature more user-friendly designs with visible water levels. 


### Ironing Plate and Temperature Control

The ironing plate's size and shape affect its effectiveness on different fabrics. The Dw9280 sports a generous 110mm wide plate with a temperature range of 75° to 220°C, suitable for all fabric types.

## FAQ


### What makes the Rowenta Dw9280 unique?

The Rowenta Dw9280 stands out due to its advanced steam technology and precise temperature control, ideal for professional-level ironing. Unlike simpler models, it features multiple steam settings and a moisture sensor that prevents water from boiling over, making it suitable for both light and heavy-duty ironing tasks. 

Its unique feature is the AutoIron mode, which automatically adjusts steam and moisture levels for optimal results on various fabrics without manual adjustments. 


### How does the moisture sensor work?

The moisture sensor continuously monitors the water level in the steam chamber. When it detects that the water is getting too low, it triggers a series of safety mechanisms to prevent the boiling of water, which can damage the iron and reduce its lifespan. 

This sensor also automatically reduces steam output as the water level decreases, ensuring continuous ironing without interruptions. 


### What fabrics are most suitable for this iron?

The Rowenta Dw9280 performs exceptionally well on all common fabric types, including cotton, linen, silk, and wool. Its Auto Iron mode automatically optimizes steam levels for each fabric type, making it versatile for mixed load ironing. 

However, it's particularly recommended for formalwear and delicate fabrics that require precise temperature control to prevent damage. 


### What maintenance does this iron require?

The iron requires minimal maintenance. Users should regularly clean the steam plate and check for mineral buildup, which can be removed using vinegar. The soleplate should be cleaned of any fabric residue after each use. 

For optimal performance, the water tank should be emptied and cleaned weekly, and any mineral deposits removed to prevent scaling. 


### How much water does it consume per ironing session?

During normal use, the Rowenta Dw9280 consumes approximately 150ml of water per ironing session, which lasts around 15-20 minutes. This conservation makes it suitable for use during long ironing sessions without frequent refilling. 

When using the AutoIron mode, water consumption may vary slightly based on fabric type and ironing duration. 


### What is the warranty period for this iron?

The Rowenta Dw9280 comes with a standard warranty of 2 years, covering both parts and labor for any manufacturing defects. This warranty period ensures peace of mind for two years of regular use. 

For extended protection, Rowenta offers a 5-year warranty upgrade, which can be purchased separately at the time of purchase for additional peace of mind.
