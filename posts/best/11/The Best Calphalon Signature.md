### What's the warranty coverage for these cookware pieces?

Calphalon covers their Signature cookware with a 10-year warranty against manufacturing defects. This protection applies to both the bonded stainless steel exterior and the aluminum core construction. 

The warranty does not cover normal wear and tear, such as scratches or marks from use, but it provides peace of mind for the cookware's core functionality.
