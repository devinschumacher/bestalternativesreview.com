### What surface texture is best for gaming with an Xxl mouse pad?

Ergonomic patterns with medium grip, like a slightly raised grid or honeycomb pattern, help prevent wrist fatigue during extended sessions. The surface should feel comfortable to the touch but not too smooth, which can reduce tracking accuracy. 

Ambidextrous designs with consistent texture across the surface provide the best control for both right- and left-handed users. The pad should feel natural to use, with no awkward resistance to movement. 


### How long does an Xxl mouse pad last with regular use?

With proper care, a high-quality Xxl mouse pad can last 2-3 years with daily use. The tracking surface, especially near the edges, may show signs of wear sooner. 

Look for pads with wear-resistant coatings and durable construction. Higher-quality materials typically maintain their performance better under regular use and cleaning.
