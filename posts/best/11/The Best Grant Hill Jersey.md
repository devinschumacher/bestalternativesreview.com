### How do I properly care for my Grant Hill jersey?

Proper care extends the life and appearance of your Grant Hill jersey. Machine wash your jersey using mild detergent in cold water, turning it inside out to protect the graphics. Avoid bleach and fabric softeners, as they can damage the print quality. 

Air drying is recommended to preserve the shape and integrity of the fabric. If you must use a dryer, use a low heat setting and remove the jersey promptly to prevent shrinkage. Store your jersey folded rather than hanging to reduce wear on the shoulders and sleeves. 


### What's the difference between Icon and Performance jerseys?

The Icon jersey prioritizes style and modern design elements. It features premium fabrics, advanced graphics, and modern fit options. This design is ideal for fans who want the latest fashion-forward look while maintaining great comfort. 

The Performance jersey focuses on cutting-edge moisture management and ventilation. It uses lighter, more technical fabrics with enhanced moisture transfer capabilities. Athletes and serious fans who prioritize on-court performance will appreciate the superior functionality of this design.

### Can I match my Grant Hill jersey with official team shorts?

Grant Hill is part of an official kit that includes shorts, socks, and other accessories. The shorts are available in matching patterns and color schemes to coordinate with your jersey. These official accessories ensure a high-quality match to your team's colors and design elements. 

Make sure to select the correct size and style of shorts – traditional cut, modern fit, or specialized sport-specific options – that complement your jersey selection. Officially licensed shorts will also have the same tag-free features and durable construction as the jersey. 


### How long do Grant Hill jerseys typically last?

A well-cared-for Grant Hill jersey can last 3-5 years with regular use, depending on the frequency of washing and the quality of care. The graphics and print quality usually maintain their integrity for 2-3 years with proper care. 

The most durable elements are the reinforced seams, tag-free collars, and premium materials. Common signs of wear include fading, color bleeding during washing, and loss of graphic detail. Regular inspection for these signs helps determine when your jersey may need replacement.
