## Buyer's Guide

A bath board serves as a practical solution for showering without soap dishes cluttering your bathroom. This guide outlines key features and considerations to help you find the right bath board for your needs. 


### Dimensions and Design

Standard bath boards measure around 12 inches by 6 inches, but wider options up to 18 inches are available. Consider the board's thickness (typically 1 to 1.5 inches) and material. Common options include plastic, glass, bamboo, and stone replicas, each with different water resistant properties and styling. 


### Installation Requirements

Assess your shower's available space and ensure proper drainage. Boards must be mounted securely to prevent slipping. Options include surface-mounting (flush with the wall) or inset-mounting (pulled back slightly). The mounting hardware should match your bathroom's aesthetic and provide the necessary support. 


### Non-Slip Features

Safety is paramount, especially for shower use. Look for boards with textured surfaces or nonslip coatings. Some designs incorporate small grooves or patterns to enhance grip while in the shower, reducing the risk of accidents. 


### Bowl Shape and Edges

The board's shape affects both functionality and style. Rounded bowls offer better water flow and ease of cleaning, while square or rectangular shapes provide more stable placement. Edges should be smooth and rounded to prevent cuts or splinters, particularly for materials like bamboo or plastic. 


## FAQ


### What is a bath board?

A bath board is a raised platform that sits inside a bathtub to create a more stable surface for bathing. It typically features non-slip surfaces and can be used with or without baths. 

Board designs vary, with some featuring built-in storage, heating elements, or support attachments for wheelchairs. The primary benefits include increased stability, better hygiene, and greater comfort during use. 


### Who needs a bath board?

Anyone who struggles with balance in the tub, has limited mobility, or prefers a more stable surface can benefit from a bath board. They're particularly useful for older adults and individuals with disabilities. 

Caregivers and families also find bath boards helpful for assisting bathers who need extra support. The boards can make bathtime safer and more comfortable for everyone involved. 


### What materials are bath boards made from?

The most common materials for bath boards include polyvinyl chloride (PVC), plastic, and rubber. Each material offers different advantages in terms of durability, weight capacity, and affordability. 

Premium boards may incorporate aluminum or composite materials for enhanced stability and longevity. Many modern boards also feature reinforced edges and extra thick cores for safety. 


### How do I install a bath board?

Installation typically requires simply placing the bath board inside the tub, though some models come with attachments for securing to the sides of the bathtub. The process usually takes less than 15 minutes. 

When installing, ensure the board is centered and level. For tubs with claw feet, consider using short risers to maintain proper water level. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for optimal results. 


### What maintenance is required for bath boards?

Regular cleaning with mild soap and water maintains the board's hygiene and appearance. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners that could damage the surface or coating. 

Check the board monthly for any signs of wear, damage, or loose attachments. If using a heating model, test the unit regularly to ensure proper function and safety. 


### How much space do I need for a bath board?

Standard bath boards measure approximately 18 inches by 36 inches, requiring at least 15 inches of free space in the tub for proper placement and movement. 

Consider the specific model's dimensions when selecting a bath board. Some designs include wheels or additional features that may reduce available space inside the tub.
