### What scents are included in Yves Saint Laurent's perfume collection?

Yves Saint Laurent's perfume collection features a diverse array of scents, from fresh and maritime to warm and woody compositions. The collection includes unisex fragrances and gender-specific perfumes, allowing both men and women to explore their scent preferences. 

The brand is known for its iconic products like YSL Mon Paris and YSL Rouge, which have become firmly established in the fragrance market since their launches. 


### What distinguishes the men's cologne from women's perfumes?

Men's colognes typically feature stronger, more intense scent projections compared to women's perfumes. The concentration of fragrance oils in colognes is generally lower than that in perfumes, resulting in a lighter, fresher impression. 

Women's perfumes often contain more complex and sophisticated compositions, incorporating additional notes that create a fuller, more distinct personality in the scent.

### How should I store YSL cologne to maintain its quality?

Store YSL cologne in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat sources. High temperatures can degrade the perfume's quality and alter its scent profile over time. 

Keep the bottle tightly sealed when not in use, as exposure to air can accelerate the fragrance's deterioration. Replace the protective lid after each use to maintain optimal preservation. 


### What is the recommended application technique for YSL cologne?

Apply YSL cologne to pulse points where the skin's natural body heat can release the fragrance, such as wrists, neck, and behind the ears. This targeted application allows the scent to develop beautifully over time. 

Avoid rubbing the applied area, as this can cause the perfume to dissipate more quickly. Instead, allow the fragrance to settle naturally on the skin.

### How long does YSL cologne typically last on the skin?

Most YSL colognes provide lasting power between 4 to 6 hours when applied correctly. Factors influencing longevity include skin type, temperature, and activity level. 

For extended wear, apply a light moisturizer before spraying the cologne, as dry skin allows the fragrance to evaporate more quickly. 


### Are YSL colognes suitable for sensitive skin?

While YSL colognes are generally well-tolerated, individuals with sensitive skin should test the product on a small area before full application. Allergies to specific ingredients can vary. 

The fragrance concentration in colognes is typically lower than in perfumes, making them a potentially safer option for those with sensitive skin.
