## Buyer's Guide

Cats are notorious for scratching and damaging furniture, but there's no need to say goodbye to your favorite armchair. From deterrent sprays to durable covers, there's a furniture protector out there for every furry friend and every piece of furniture. This guide will help you find the right protector for your cat and your home. 


### Cat-Soothing Furniture Protectors

Many cats scratch furniture out of instinct rather than malicious intent. Look for protectors that incorporate calming pheromones or provide vertical scratching surfaces to redirect your cat's behavior. These protectors help your pet develop good scratching habits while preserving your furniture. 


### Durable Protector Materials

Not all protectors are created equal. For high-traffic areas or tough fabrics, opt for protectors made from dense foam, rubber, or canvas. These materials resist punctures and wear better under your cat's claws. For softer furniture like couches and loveseats, consider protectors with a padding layer that cushions both the furniture and your cat's claws. 


### Ergonomic Design Features

A well-designed protector should enhance your furniture's comfort while protecting it. Look for protectors with contour shapes that follow the furniture's curves, providing natural support for your cat. Some protectors feature built-in hammocks or lounging pads that double as resting spots for your cat. 


## FAQ


### What are furniture protectors made from?

Cats' claws are composed of keratin, a protein similar to human hair and nails. Furniture protectors are typically made from materials that are less vulnerable to claw damage than the surfaces in question. These materials can include vinyl, leatherette, or specially designed scratch panels. 

Many protectors are backed with high-tack adhesive or sewn into a cover for armrests and tabletops, while others are made from durable fabrics with anti-scratch coatings. 


### How do furniture protectors prevent scratches?

Furniture protectors work by creating a barrier between the cat's claws and the vulnerable surface. When a cat scratches a protected area, the damage occurs on the protector rather than the underlying furniture. 

Some protectors are further enhanced with technology such as microtextured surfaces that deter scratching or emit ultrasonic signals that cats find unpleasant. 


### Are furniture protectors suitable for all furniture types?

Most furniture protectors are suitable for solid wood, MDF, particle board, and upholstered furniture. However, they may not be appropriate for delicate surfaces like marble or certain types of glass. 

For best results, measure the furniture piece carefully and select a protector that matches both the size and shape of the area to be protected. 


### How long do furniture protectors last?

With regular use, furniture protectors typically last between 1-3 years before needing replacement, depending on the material quality and installation method. 

Properly maintained protectors can outlast cheaper alternatives, but premium materials may justify higher initial costs for longer-lasting protection. 


### Do furniture protectors damage cats' claws?

Quality protectors are designed to prevent damage to both cats' claws and furniture, with most materials being too rigid for cats to harm their nails when scratching. 

Some protectors include soft inner layers that cushion the impact of scratching, while others feature grooved surfaces that help maintain claw health by preventing overgrowth. 


### How difficult is it to install furniture protectors?

Most protectors are designed for easy DIY installation, with options available for both indoor and outdoor use. The process typically involves measuring, applying adhesive (if applicable), and securing the protector in place. 

For more complex pieces of furniture, professional installation may be recommended to ensure the protector fits properly and remains stable over time.
