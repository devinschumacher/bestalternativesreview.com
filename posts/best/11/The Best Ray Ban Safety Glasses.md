Ray Ban safety glasses offer excellent protection while maintaining the brand's signature style. These glasses combine fashion elements with robust safety features, making them suitable for various work environments. 


### Impact Protection

All Ray Ban safety glasses meet or exceed ANSI Z87.1 standards for high-impact protection. Look for lenses that are impact-resistant, typically made from polycarbonate for maximum durability. 


### UV Protection

Safety glasses with UV protection shield your eyes from harmful rays while maintaining impact resistance. The lenses should block 100% of UVA and UVB radiation to safeguard your eyes.

Consider models with wraparound styles for increased protection against side impacts. Some glasses offer moisture resistance, which is beneficial in industrial settings where exposure to water or facial washing may occur. 


## FAQ


### What makes Ray Ban safety glasses different from regular sunglasses?

Ray Ban safety glasses exceed basic sunglasses standards by meeting strict ANSI Z87+ impact resistance requirements. They feature enhanced lens and frame durability, as well as protective coatings specifically engineered for industrial and construction environments. 

Unlike ordinary sunglasses, these glasses are designed to withstand serious impacts from flying objects, dust, and chemicals while providing superior optical clarity and UV protection. 


### Can Ray Ban safety glasses be prescription-compatible?

Yes, Ray Ban safety glasses can be customized with prescription lenses through authorized eyewear providers. This allows users to maintain their visual correction while receiving the protective benefits of safety eyewear. 

Prescription options include single vision, bifocal, and progressive lenses, though availability may vary by frame style. It's important to consult with an eyewear professional for proper prescription fitting. 


### What materials are Ray Ban safety glasses made from?

Ray Ban safety glasses are constructed from high-impact-resistant materials like polycarbonate, TR90, and rubber. These materials offer exceptional durability while providing lightweight comfort during prolonged wear. 

Frame components may also include stainless steel for added strength in specific models, particularly in frames that incorporate spring hinges or adjustable features. 


### How should I clean Ray Ban safety glasses?

Regular cleaning requires mild soap and warm water. For the lenses, use a dedicated lens cleaning solution and soft microfiber cloths to prevent scratches. Avoid harsh chemicals, abrasive materials, or glass cleaners. 

When cleaning the frames, use a mild soap solution and gently wipe with a soft cloth. Store glasses in a padded case when not in use to prevent scratches and maintain shape. 


### What is the warranty coverage for Ray Ban safety glasses?

Ray Ban offers a limited warranty covering manufacturing defects for a period of two years from the date of purchase. This warranty typically includes replacement of faulty lenses or frames under specific conditions. 

For extended protection, Ray Ban also offers an optional insurance coverage plan that extends protection beyond basic manufacturing defects, covering damage from accidents or loss. 


### How do I choose the right size Ray Ban safety glasses?

Frame size selection should prioritize a close, comfortable fit while allowing enough room for glasses prescriptions. Measure across the widest part of your face (just above the ears) to determine the ideal frame width. 

Check the frame's temple length to ensure it measures between your ears and the back of your head. Proper fit prevents slippage and ensures consistent lens alignment.
