## Buyer's Guide

A nursery dresser serves as the centerpiece of a baby's room, combining storage with a decorative touch. When selecting the right one, consider these key factors to find a piece that meets your needs and style preferences. 


### Size and Space

Measure your nursery to determine the available wall space. Consider both the width of the dresser and the space you need for changing tables, cribs, or rocking chairs. For smaller rooms, compact dressers with fewer drawers might be more practical. 


### Storage Capacity

Evaluate the number of drawers and their sizes to match your storage needs. Multiple smaller drawers can be more convenient for organizing baby items, while larger drawers may be necessary for storing seasonal clothing or extra supplies. 


### Construction Quality

Invest in a dresser made from sturdy materials like solid wood or engineered wood with a durable finish. Check for quality construction with secure drawer glides and dovetail joints. The finish should be safe for children and resistant to scratches and moisture. 


### Style and Functionality

Select a dresser that complements your nursery's existing furniture and decor style. Consider features like adjustable shelving, built-in organizers, or changing stations if your dresser will double as a diaper station. The finish and hardware should match your room's aesthetic while providing easy maintenance. 


## FAQ


### What features should I look for in a nursery dresser?

A good nursery dresser should offer ample storage with multiple deep drawers, convenient pull-out shelves, and organization features like dividers or adjustable shelf systems. The finish should be safe for children, with smooth, rounded edges and non-toxic materials. 

Consider additional features like nightlight capabilities, built-in changing stations, or open shelving for baby items. The style should match your nursery's décor while providing practical functionality. 


### How do I choose the right size nursery dresser?

Measure your nursery's available space, including doorways and electrical outlets, to ensure the dresser fits properly. A standard single dresser is 18-24 inches wide and 29-30 inches tall, while double dressers are approximately 42 inches wide. 

Count your storage needs and add 1-2 feet of additional space for every three drawers. Consider if you need extra shelves or open storage options for items like diapers and wipes. 


### What materials are safest for nursery furniture?

Choose dressers made from solid wood or engineered woods with smooth, sealed surfaces. Avoid dressers with loose parts, sharp edges, or decorative elements that could pose choking hazards. 

Finish materials should be certified safe for children, meeting standards like ASTM F1487 for environmental emissions. Look for dressers with non-toxic finishes that resist scratches and damage. 


### How should I care for a nursery dresser?

Regularly wipe the dresser's surface with a mild soap solution and water, avoiding harsh chemicals that could damage the finish. Remove dust and debris using a microfiber cloth or soft brush. 

Check for loose screws or parts monthly, and replace any damaged hardware immediately. Store heavy items in the bottom drawers to maintain even weight distribution. 


### What safety standards should I look for?

A nursery dresser should meet ASTM standards for stability, securing the top with a 1-2 inch clearance from walls. The dresser should resist tipping when loaded as specified. 

Check for safety features like anti-tip brackets and safety locks on drawers. The dressers should have secure hardware that resists pulling and loosening over time. 


### How do I choose the right number of drawers?

Consider your storage needs and the contents you'll store. 4-6 deep drawers provide generous storage for clothing and linens, with additional shallow drawers for smaller items like blankets and toys. 

Think about future growth – will you need more storage as your child ages? Dressers with 8-10 drawers offer flexibility for expanding storage needs.
