## Buyer's Guide

Electric pressure washers offer an efficient way to clean driveways, decks, and other outdoor surfaces without the noise and emissions of gas-powered alternatives. Understanding the key specifications and features will help you select the right model for your cleaning needs. 


### Power Source and Voltage

Electric pressure washers come in corded and cordless variants. Corded models offer consistent power but require access to an electrical outlet. Cordless models use rechargeable batteries, providing greater mobility but limited runtime. Major voltage options are 120V for standard household outlets and 240V for professional-grade units. 


### Water Pressure and Flow Rate

The cleaning power of an electric pressure washer is measured in pounds per square inch (psi) and gallons per minute (gpm). For general outdoor cleaning, look for machines ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 psi with 2 to 4 gpm. Higher psi provides better penetration for stubborn dirt but reduces water efficiency. 


### Trigger Sprayer and Nozzle Options

These features allow you to adjust the water stream from a powerful jet for tough jobs to a fine mist for delicate surfaces. The trigger sprayer controls water flow, while nozzles change the spray pattern. Common nozzle angles include 15° for cleaning, 25° for precision work, and 40° for general cleaning. 


### Build Quality and Accessories

Major components like the pump, motor, and hose connections should be made of durable materials like stainless steel or reinforced rubber. Check that the washer includes essential accessories such as a wand, hose, nozzle tips, and filter. The included spray gun should have a comfortable grip and smooth trigger mechanism. 


## FAQ


### What is an electric pressure washer?

Electric pressure washers use an electric motor to power a pump that generates high water pressure for cleaning purposes. They're generally quieter and more portable than gas-powered models. 

Unlike gas washers, electric models don't have an onboard fuel source, which makes them safer to operate and maintain. However, they require access to electricity and may not be suitable for outdoor use in areas without power. 


### What are the main benefits of electric pressure washers?

Electric pressure washers are highly energy-efficient and require minimal maintenance compared to gas models. They're also safer to use around children and pets. 

Their quiet operation makes them ideal for early morning or evening cleaning sessions, and they typically produce less heat than gas models, making them gentler on surfaces. 


### What are the drawbacks of electric pressure washers?

Electric washers can't be used in areas without electricity and may be less powerful in very cold conditions. They also typically cost more upfront than gas models. 

While safer to operate, they're not as flexible as cordless gas models for cleaning in remote locations. Additionally, they can't handle the same types of outdoor jobs as their fuel-powered counterparts. 


### What features should I look for in an electric pressure washer?

Choose a model with adjustable pressure settings for different cleaning jobs and an ergonomic trigger sprayer for better control. A hot water option can be helpful for tough cleaning tasks. 

Consider the electrical requirements (230V vs 110V), water pump type (piston or diaphragm), and whether the washer comes with a variety of nozzles and cleaning accessories. 


### How do I maintain an electric pressure washer?

Regularly inspect the electrical components for signs of wear and keep the motor and pump well-lubricated. Always drain the water tank and remove debris before storage. 

Check the connection between the hose and washer for leaks, and ensure all safety features, including grounding, are functioning properly. 


### Can I use an electric pressure washer during power outages?

No, electric pressure washers require an external power source and cannot operate during a power outage. Consider portable models with built-in generators for backup power. 

Some residential generators can power pressure washers, but you'll need to have the generator set up and running before using the washer.
