Cape Robbin heels combine style and practicality, making them a popular choice for women's footwear. When selecting your perfect pair, several factors will influence your decision, from personal comfort preferences to intended use.

### Cushioning and Fit

Proper cushioning in the heel and ball of the foot is crucial for comfort during extended wear. The fit should be snug but not tight, with enough room in the toe box to prevent pressure points. Consider wider options if you have broad feet. 


### MATERIALS AND CARE

High-quality leather provides durability and a sophisticated look, while synthetic materials offer affordability and water resistance. Opt for protective finishes like polish or wax to maintain your heels' appearance and extend their lifespan.
