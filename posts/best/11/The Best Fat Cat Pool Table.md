A fat cat pool table combines generous playing space with traditional billiards gameplay. These tables typically feature larger playing surfaces with more pronounced curves, offering a unique playing experience compared to standard rectangular models. 


### Size and Space Requirements

Before purchasing, measure your available space carefully. Fat cat tables usually range from 10 to 12 feet in length, with a minimum recommended clearance of 1.5 to 2 feet around the table for comfortable play. Consider the room's height, particularly if you're mounting the table against a ceiling, as these models can reach up to 30 inches in height.

### Construction and Materials

High-quality materials are crucial for lasting performance. Look for tables with solid hardwood construction for the frame and playing surface, typically composed of 1-inch thick slate. The legs should be stable and secure, often featuring adjustable feet for level placement. Premium models may include features like metal support braces and precision-finished edges. 


### Pocket Design and Layout

The pocket design significantly affects gameplay and ball control. Traditional fat cat tables use six corner pockets with additional mid-table and center pockets. Consider the pocket size and shape, as larger pockets can impact ball rotation and strategy. Premium models often feature diamond-shaped pockets and precise pocket dimensions for consistent performance.
