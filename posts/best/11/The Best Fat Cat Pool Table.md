The pocket design significantly affects gameplay and ball control. Traditional fat cat tables use six corner pockets with additional mid-table and center pockets. Consider the pocket size and shape, as larger pockets can impact ball rotation and strategy. Premium models often feature diamond-shaped pockets and precise pocket dimensions for consistent performance.
