## Buyer's Guide

Food sensitivity testing helps determine which foods might be causing uncomfortable digestive or allergy-like symptoms. These tests differ from food allergy tests in that they measure immune system reactions other than IgE antibodies. 


### Understanding Food Sensitivities

Food sensitivities involve the immune system reacting to specific foods, often causing symptoms like bloating, headaches, or joint pain. These reactions typically develop slowly and can be difficult to link directly to food intake, making testing valuable for identifying triggers. 

![Food-Sensitivity-Test-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Food-Sensitivity-Test-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Test Types: Common Methods

The most reliable food sensitivity tests measure biomarkers in blood or saliva. Methods vary, but many tests look for changes in white blood cell activity when exposed to potential trigger foods. 


### Accuracy and Limitations

While many dietary tests have improved in accuracy, their reliability can vary. Some experts recommend following an elimination diet and monitoring symptoms before testing to get the most accurate results. 

![Food-Sensitivity-Test-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Food-Sensitivity-Test-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Interpreting Results

Results should be reviewed with a healthcare provider who understands food sensitivities and may recommend follow-up testing or a food diary to confirm findings. The provider can also help distinguish between genuine sensitivities and psychological or non-immune factors. 


## FAQ

![Food-Sensitivity-Test-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Food-Sensitivity-Test-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a food sensitivity test?

A food sensitivity test is a medical examination that identifies specific foods triggering allergic reactions or intolerances. Unlike food allergies, sensitivities produce symptoms hours to days after consumption, making them harder to detect. 

Common symptoms include digestive issues, migraines, skin rashes, and joint pain. Identifying these triggers helps in managing symptoms and improving overall health through dietary adjustments. 


### How accurate are food sensitivity tests?

The accuracy of food sensitivity tests varies. Blood tests measuring IgG antibodies are the most common but have limited scientific support. Skin prick tests measuring IgE antibodies are more reliable for allergies but less so for sensitivities. 

Avoid relying solely on test results. Integrating dietary changes with symptom tracking provides the most accurate assessment of food sensitivities. 

![Food-Sensitivity-Test-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Food-Sensitivity-Test-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Who should consider a food sensitivity test?

Individuals with unexplained digestive issues, migraines, skin problems, or autoimmune conditions often test for food sensitivities. People with a family history of allergies may also benefit from testing. 

Consult your doctor before testing, especially if you've experienced severe allergic reactions or have other medical conditions. 


### What happens during a food sensitivity test?

Common tests include blood draws measuring IgG antibodies or skin prick tests using potential allergen extracts. Some practitioners use more specialized methods like ALCAT tests or muscle testing. 

Prepare for blood tests by fasting for 12 hours. For skin tests, avoid antihistamines and makeup around the testing area. 

![Food-Sensitivity-Test-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Food-Sensitivity-Test-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How long does it take to get results?

Results from blood tests typically take 7-14 days, depending on the laboratory. Skin tests provide immediate results but require careful interpretation by a trained professional. 

Some practitioners offer preliminary results within 24-48 hours, but comprehensive analysis usually takes longer. 


### What should I do after testing?

Work with your healthcare provider to interpret results and develop an action plan. This may include dietary changes, supplements, or further testing. 

Track your symptoms and food intake to validate test results and monitor response to dietary modifications.
