## Buyer's Guide

Martini champagne represents a blend of rich history and sophisticated flavors. When selecting your perfect bottle, several factors come into play, from the balance of sweetness to the type of glassware used. 


### Sweetness Level

Martini champagne typically falls on the drier side of the spectrum, offering notes of citrus and hints of sweetness without being overly fruity. The sweetness level, or "dosage, " ranges from Brut Nature (extremely dry) to Extra Sec, with most Martini champagnes striking a balance around Extra Dry to Sec. 


### Blending and Composition

The blend of grape varieties is crucial for Martini's characteristic flavor profile. Most premium bottles combine Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, and Pinot Meunier. The Champagne house may also add a small percentage of rare grape varieties, contributing to the blend's complexity. 


### Cork and Closure

Original Martini champagne bottles feature the distinctive "Cap d'Or" closure, a crowned cork design that became iconic in the 19th century. While modern versions often use traditional Champagne closures, authentic Martini bottles maintain this historical detail. 


### Serving and Pairing

Opt for chilled glasses with fine crystal clarity to fully appreciate Martini's elegant presentation. The traditional Martini flute is ideal, though some enthusiasts prefer wide-mouthed glasses for better aeration. Pair with light hors d'oeuvres, seafood, or creamy sauces to complement the champagne's complexity. 


## FAQ


### What is Martini Champagne?

Martini Champagne, often simply called Martini, is a premium sparkling wine that captures the essence of traditional French Champagne but with distinct Italian characteristics. It's a blend of premium Italian wines, primarily Negroamaro and Primitivo grapes, which give it a unique flavor profile. 

Martini has a rich history dating back to 1855 when it was created as a Champagne alternative. The blend's complexity comes from masterfully combining fino sherry, Pedro Ximenez, and Moscatel wines, creating a rich, full-bodied sparkler that's distinct from traditional French Champagnes. 


### How is Martini Champagne Different from French Champagne?

Martini Champagne stands out from French Champagnes through its distinctive blend of Negroamaro and Primitivo grapes, giving it a characteristically Italian flavor profile. It also features a unique blend of fino sherry, Pedro Ximenez, and Moscatel wines, resulting in a fuller-bodied and richer texture. 

While both follow similar production methods, including secondary fermentation in bottles, Martini's blend produces a wine with more intense fruitiness and a slightly sweeter finish compared to the typically drier French Champagnes. 


### What is the Best Martini Champagne to Try?

Martini's top-tier Grand Selezione is widely regarded as the best expression of the brand. It combines premium Negroamaro and Primitivo grapes with the signature blend of fino sherry, Pedro Ximenez, and Moscatel, resulting in a rich, complex sparkling wine that captures the essence of the brand. 

If you're seeking an entry-level option, the Superiore stands out for its balanced approach, featuring good acidity and a pleasant sweetness that works well with a wide range of foods. 


### What Food Pairings Work Well with Martini Champagne?

Martini's full-bodied nature makes it adaptable to various foods. It pairs exceptionally well with sushi and sashimi, complementing the delicate flavors of these Japanese delicacies. It's also excellent with spicy foods like Thai cuisine, helping to balance out heat. 

For something easier to find in the West, Martini pairs well with rich, creamy dishes, like lobster or creamy pasta. Its natural sweetness makes it a great match for buttery seafood dishes or creamy desserts. 


### Is Martini Champagne Worth the Extra Cost?

Martini Champagne offers exceptional value compared to its price point, delivering a depth of flavor and complexity that sets it apart from many similarly priced sparkling wines. The premium blend of Negroamaro, Primitivo, and the signature wine blend gives it layers of flavor that many find worth the investment. 

Whether you're hosting an elegant dinner party or treating yourself, Martini's rich, full-bodied character and unique Italian profile make it a standout choice that surpasses expectations for its category. 


### How Should Martini Champagne be Stored?

Like all sparkling wines, Martini Champagne should be stored horizontally to keep the sediment (traces of yeast) against the cork. Store it in a cool, dark place away from vibrations and direct sunlight to maintain its freshness and flavor. 

Once opened, consume the bottle within a few hours to capture its best flavor. If you need to store it partially open, keep it refrigerated and consume within 24 hours to prevent oxidation.
