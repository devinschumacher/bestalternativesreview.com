## Buyer's Guide

Dragon stones have become popular focal points in both new and existing homes. These decorative pieces often feature intricate designs and come in various materials. Understanding key aspects like size options, material durability, and mounting requirements will help you select the right dragon stone for your space. 


### Size and Proportions

### Material Quality

Dragon stones typically come in resin, stone composite, or fully sculpted stone. Resin stones are lightweight and cost-effective but may show wear over time. Stone composite offers durability similar to natural stone while maintaining affordability. Fully sculpted stone pieces provide lasting quality and realism but at a higher price point. 


### Mounting Requirements

Most dragon stones require wall mounting due to their weight and size. Check the stone's mounting specifications to ensure your display area has adequate structural support. Proper mounting hardware and techniques are essential for safely displaying these decorative pieces.

### Decorative Elements

When selecting your stone, evaluate the craftsmanship of the design and the smoothness of the finish for lasting visual appeal.
