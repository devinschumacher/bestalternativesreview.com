### Capacity and Design

The primary function of a coach pill box is to store medications, so capacity is a key consideration. Standard sizes range from 14 to 24 compartments, each suited for different storage needs.

The box typically includes compartments for seven days of medication, with each hour of the day represented. This allows users to plan their medication schedule and ensures they don't miss any doses. 


### What materials are Coach Pill Boxes usually made from?

Coach Pill Boxes are commonly made from BPA-free plastic, which is both safe and durable. The material is selected to prevent leakage and to protect the medication from environmental factors. 

Some premium models feature specialized coatings that resist fading from sunlight, extending the box's lifespan and maintaining clear readability of the medication labels.

### How do I properly use a Coach Pill Box?

To use a Coach Pill Box effectively, fill each chamber with the correct medication according to your daily schedule. Most boxes have clear labeling indicating which compartment corresponds to which time of day. 

Each evening, remove the top and check that all compartments contain the correct medications for the upcoming day. This daily check helps prevent dosing errors and ensures you're staying on your medication schedule. 


### Can Coach Pill Boxes be used for all types of medication?

Coach Pill Boxes are suitable for most oral medications, including tablets, capsules, and small pellets. However, they are not recommended for medications that need to be refrigerated or those that might dissolve in the chamber.

Clean your Coach Pill Box weekly with warm water and mild soap, ensuring all compartments are thoroughly rinsed. Dry completely before use to prevent water spots and ease medication insertion.

### What features should I look for when selecting a Coach Pill Box?

Consider a box with large, clear compartments for easier medication identification, especially if you take several medications or have visual impairments. 

Some models feature waterproof bases to prevent spills, LED lights to mark evening compartments, and locking lids for security. Evaluate which features are most important based on your specific needs and lifestyle.
