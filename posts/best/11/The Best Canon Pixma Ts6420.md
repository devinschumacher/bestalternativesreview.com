## FAQ


### What's the difference between the Canon Pixma Ts6420 and the Ts6420n?

The primary distinction is in their connectivity options. The Ts6420 offers Wi-Fi and USB connectivity, while the Ts6420n adds Ethernet for wired network access. 

This means the Ts6420 is ideal for USB-connected computers, tablets, or phones, while the Ts6420n is better suited for offices or home networks that already have wired internet infrastructure. 


### Can the Canon Pixma Ts6420 handle color photos of professional quality?

Yes, the printer uses four color cartridges (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black) that deliver vibrant, professional-quality prints with a color resolution of up to 4800 x 1200 dpi. 

It's particularly well-suited for photos, documents, and presentations that need accurate color reproduction. 


### How long does it take for the Canon Pixma Ts6420 to warm up and start printing?

The printer typically takes about 30 seconds to warm up after being turned on or receiving a print job. For resumes, documents, and photos, it prints in black-and-white in about 7 seconds and color prints in 12 seconds. 

Page-to-page printing (double-sided documents) adds approximately 2 seconds to the print time. 


### What size paper can the Canon Pixma Ts6420 handle?

It supports standard paper sizes including A4 (8.3" x 11.7"), Letter (8.5" x 11"), and Legal (8.5" x 14") sheets. The photo size capability allows printing up to 4x6 inch photos directly from USB drives or memory cards. 

Additional features include a 250-sheet paper tray and a 20-sheet manual feed slot for thicker or specialized paper like photo paper or cardstock. 


### What's included in the Canon Pixma Ts6420 starter kit?

The starter kit includes the printer itself, a USB cable, an ink cartridge set (two black and two color), and the basic software installation CD. 

It's important to note that the starter kit cartridges have slightly reduced yields compared to regular replacement cartridges, so plan to purchase additional ink or toner when you receive your printer. 


### How much does it cost to print a black-and-white page?

According to Canon's official figures, the cost per black-and-white page ranges from 4.5 cents to 8.2 cents, depending on the package and volume of prints you purchase. 

For color pages, the cost is approximately 7 cents to 12 cents per page, again varying based on the specific ink cartridge and volume purchased.
