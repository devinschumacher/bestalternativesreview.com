## Buyer's Guide

Allsteel chairs combine durability, comfort, and modern design to create versatile seating solutions for any workspace. Understanding key features and considerations will help you select the right chair for your needs and budget. 


### Frame Construction

### Seat Materials

Seats come in various materials including polypropylene, HDPE, or mesh. Polypropylene and HDPE offer excellent resistance to scratches and chemicals, making them suitable for harsh environments. Mesh chairs provide superior breathability and moisture resistance, ideal for extended use and warmer climates. 


### Base Design

Base options include 5-star metal, 4-leg solid wood, or castors for mobility. 5-star bases with dual-wheel castors offer smooth movement and stability, ideal for carpeted or hard-surface floors. Solid wood bases provide a classic aesthetic but may dent easily. Consider the floor surface and chair movement requirements when selecting a base type.
