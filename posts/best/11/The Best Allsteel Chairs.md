## Buyer's Guide

Allsteel chairs combine durability, comfort, and modern design to create versatile seating solutions for any workspace. Understanding key features and considerations will help you select the right chair for your needs and budget. 


### Frame Construction

Consider the chair's intended use - heavy-duty models with steel frames are ideal for frequent use in office or industrial settings.

### Seat Materials

Seats come in various materials including polypropylene, HDPE, or mesh. Polypropylene and HDPE offer excellent resistance to scratches and chemicals, making them suitable for harsh environments. Mesh chairs provide superior breathability and moisture resistance, ideal for extended use and warmer climates. 


### Base Design

Base options include 5-star metal, 4-leg solid wood, or castors for mobility. 5-star bases with dual-wheel castors offer smooth movement and stability, ideal for carpeted or hard-surface floors. Solid wood bases provide a classic aesthetic but may dent easily. Consider the floor surface and chair movement requirements when selecting a base type.

### Adjustability Features

Key adjustments include seat height, backrest angle, and armrest positioning. Seat height adjustment ranges typically between 16-21 inches, while backrest angles can vary from fixed to fully reclining. Armrests should be independently adjustable for height and tilt to accommodate different user preferences and desk heights.
