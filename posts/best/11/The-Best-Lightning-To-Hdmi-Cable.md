## Buyer's Guide

Connecting your device to a display often requires bridging the gap between different video standards. Our guide helps you choose the right lightning to HDMI cable by explaining key specifications, cable lengths, and compatibility considerations. 


### Understanding Video Resolution

The cable's maximum supported resolution determines what you can connect. Common resolutions include 1080p, 4K, and 8K. Check your device and display specifications to ensure your cable matches or exceeds the required resolution. 


### Considering Cable Length

Standard lightning to HDMI cables range from 1 to 15 feet. Longer cables can experience signal degradation, especially with high resolutions. For extended runs, look for specialized cables with enhanced shielding or consider alternative solutions like display port adapters with longer cable options. 


### Evaluating USB-C Adapters

While pure lightning to HDMI cables are common, some devices offer USB-C ports instead. USB-C adapters provide additional flexibility but may introduce extra latency and power consumption. Evaluate both the adapter and cable specifications to maintain optimal performance. 


### Checking Power Delivery Requirements

Certain displays require higher power for features like HDMI 2.1 and 4K at 120Hz. Basic cables may not deliver sufficient power, causing display issues or no connection. Look for cables specifically labeled as Power Delivery 3.0 compliant to ensure stable performance.
