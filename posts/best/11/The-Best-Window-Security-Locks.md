## Buyer's Guide

Window security locks significantly enhance home security by preventing unauthorized entry through windows. These locks vary in type, complexity, and installation requirements, making it crucial to understand your options before purchasing. 


### Types of Window Security Locks

Common types include mortise locks, lever-set locks, and pin tumbler locks. Mortise locks offer the highest security but require professional installation. Lever-set locks provide strong security with easier installation. Pin tumbler locks are available in various forms, including surface-mount and mortise styles. 


### Key Technical Considerations

Security ratings, such as the Latchbolt and Lever Bolt certifications, indicate the lock's resistance to force and pick attack. Key features to consider include keyless entry options, deadbolt length for added security, and the number of locking points (latches and bolts). 


### Installation and Compatibility

Ensure the lock matches your window frame type (wood, aluminum, vinyl) and hardware specifications. Proper installation requires appropriate tools and may affect window operation. Consider locks with adjustable mechanisms for easier installation in different frame types. 


### Maintenance and Durability

Look for locks made from corrosion-resistant materials like brass or stainless steel, especially for exterior windows. Regular maintenance, including lubrication of moving parts and checking for proper function, extends lock lifespan. Higher-quality locks often include warranties covering material defects and labor for installation. 


## FAQ


### What types of window security locks are available?

Windows security locks come in various types, each designed to prevent forced entry: - Night latches prevent the window from being opened from the outside

- Window stays keep windows closed and secure

- Window wedges create a physical barrier against forced entry

- Multi-point locks secure both the top and bottom of the window frame

Most window locks bolt into place when locked, while some use keys for better access control. They're available in different finishes to match your window frames. 


### How do I measure for window security locks?

Measure the distance between the inside edge of the window frame and the window stop. This measurement determines the lock's bolt throw. 

Also measure the width of the window frame where the lock will be installed. This ensures the lock fits within the frame's dimensions. 


### What materials are window security locks made from?

Most window locks are made from hardened steel or brass for maximum security. Some have zinc-plated finishes to resist corrosion. 

Higher-end locks use solid brass construction and decorative finishes like bronze or nickel plating. 


### How do window security locks prevent forced entry?

They prevent forced entry by creating physical barriers that require significant force to overcome. Most locks engage multiple points of the window frame. 

Multi-point locks distribute resistance across the window frame, making it much more difficult for intruders to force the window open. 


### Where should I install window security locks?

Install locks on all windows that lead to the outside, including casements, double-hungs, and sliding windows. Single-pane windows are primary targets. 

Consider installing locks on interior doors as well, especially those that lead to exterior points of entry. 


### How do I maintain window security locks?

Clean and lubricate the lock mechanism with a dry lubricant monthly. Check the bolt action to ensure proper engagement. 

Regularly inspect the lock's mounting points for signs of corrosion or wear. A damaged mounting bracket can compromise the lock's security.
