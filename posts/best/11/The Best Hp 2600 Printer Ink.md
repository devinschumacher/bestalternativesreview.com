## Buyer's Guide

The HP 2600 printer is a popular choice for small offices and home users, known for its reliability and straightforward ink cartridge system. Understanding the different ink types and cartridge configurations can help you select the right supplies and maintain optimal print quality. 


### Understanding Ink Cartridge Configurations
