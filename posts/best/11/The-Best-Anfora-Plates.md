## Buyer's Guide

Anfora plates represent a delightful fusion of ancient craftsmanship and modern tableware. Originating from classical Greek and Roman times, these shallow dishes now offer a sophisticated addition to contemporary dining collections. Understanding their key characteristics and how to select the right pieces can help you appreciate their beauty and functionality thoroughly. 


### Size and Shape Variations

Standard anfora plates typically range from 8 to 14 inches in diameter, with varying depths that usually don't exceed 1.5 inches. Common shapes include rounded corners and straight edges, though some reproductions incorporate decorative motifs around the rim. The shallow design makes them most practical for serving light appetizers, tapas, or cheese courses.

### Ceramic Quality and Material

Most anfora plates are made from high-fired ceramic, ensuring durability while maintaining a lightweight feel. The firing process gives the plates their characteristic cool touch and resistance to chipping. Quality variations can affect the glazing: the best pieces should have a smooth, consistent surface without visible imperfections. 


### Decorative Elements

While some anfora plates feature plain white surfaces, many incorporate natural motifs like leaf designs or simple patterns inspired by classical Greek pottery. The decorative elements often influence the plate's character – earthy brown-toned pieces with simple outlines might suit traditional setups better than intricately patterned versions.

### Care and Maintenance

Proper care ensures these ceramic pieces maintain their quality and appearance. Hand wash with mild soap and warm water immediately after use to prevent food residue from setting. For daily dining, consider using coaster-plates to protect both your table and the ceramic pieces. Store them in a dry place, either individually or in a stack separated by paper towels to prevent scratches. 


## FAQ

![Anfora-Plates-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Anfora-Plates-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are Anfora plates?

Classic Anfora plates are crafted from terracotta clay, often featuring elegant Mediterranean or Roman-inspired designs. These plates carry historical and cultural significance, merging functionality with artistic appeal. 

The term "Anfora" traditionally refers to ancient Mediterranean ceramic containers, and modern plates carry this name to honor their heritage while adapting to contemporary dining needs. 


### What makes Anfora plates unique?

Unlike mass-produced dishes, each Anfora plate is handmade, resulting in unique variations in size, shape, and texture. This craftsmanship gives each piece a distinct character that mass-produced alternatives cannot match. 

The terracotta material allows for natural temperature regulation, keeping food slightly cooler than conventional ceramic plates. This makes them particularly useful for serving hot foods without the initial intense heat. 

![Anfora-Plates-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Anfora-Plates-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How should Anfora plates be cared for?

Clean Anfora plates with mild soap and water immediately after use. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or steel wool, as these can scratch the surface and dull the finish. 

To maintain their natural patina, hand wash is recommended. If desired, you can apply a food-safe sealer after the first use, though this is optional and depends on how frequently the plates are used. 


### Can Anfora plates go in the dishwasher?

While some manufacturers recommend hand washing for the best results, many modern Anfora plates are dishwasher-safe. Check your specific plate's instructions for guidance. 

If using a dishwasher, avoid overcrowding the rack and use the gentle cycle with reduced detergent to prevent damage and ensure proper cleaning.

### How durable are Anfora plates?

Modern Anfora plates are designed to be both functional and durable, capable of withstanding everyday use and washing. While they may not be as resistant to impact as tempered glass, they generally hold up well under normal dishware conditions. 

These plates are particularly suitable for everyday use and casual entertaining, offering a practical alternative to traditional ceramics while maintaining their artistic integrity. 


### Are Anfora plates suitable for microwave use?

Most Anfora plates are safe for microwave use, though it's important to check the manufacturer's guidelines first. The terracotta material allows for even heating and prevents hotspots that might occur with some ceramic pieces. 

These plates are ideal for serving dishes directly from the microwave, making them convenient for both casual meals and informal dining occasions.
