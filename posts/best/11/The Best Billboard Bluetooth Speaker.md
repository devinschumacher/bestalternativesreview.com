## Buyer's Guide

A billboard Bluetooth speaker delivers powerful audio in outdoor settings, combining reliable wireless connectivity with rugged construction. These speakers typically feature weather-resistant materials and robust drivers capable of handling high volumes. Consider several key factors when selecting a billboard Bluetooth speaker, including weatherproofing standards, battery life, connectivity options, and speaker configurations. 


### Weatherproofing Standards

Choose a speaker with IP67 or better rating for dust and water resistance. The IP rating consists of two digits: the first indicates dust protection (6 being completely dust-tight), and the second shows water resistance (7 meaning immersion up to 1 meter for 30 minutes). Higher ratings offer better protection in harsh environments. 


### Battery Life

Billboard speakers often run on rechargeable batteries, so look for models with substantial capacity. The backup time should match your typical usage pattern - at least 8 hours for casual use, or up to 12-24 hours for extended outdoor events. Consider speakers with multiple battery packs for continuous playback when extended runtime is needed. 


### Connectivity Options

While Bluetooth is standard, some speakers offer additional connectivity features like USB ports for direct audio input, 3.5mm jacks for wired connections, or voice control integration. Check if the model supports multi-device pairing and has good audio range and stability for your intended environment. 


### Speaker Configurations

Most billboard speakers feature single drivers, but larger models may include multiple drivers for improved sound quality. Consider whether you need a monaural or stereo configuration, as well as any dedicated bass drivers for enhanced low-end performance. The number and placement of drivers affect sound dispersion and clarity in outdoor spaces.
