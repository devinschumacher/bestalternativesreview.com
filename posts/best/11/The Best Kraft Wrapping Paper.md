## Buyer's Guide

Kraft wrapping paper combines environmental consciousness with practicality, making it a popular choice for gift-giving and home organization. This guide examines the key features of kraft wrapping paper, helping you make an informed decision based on your specific needs and preferences. 


### Material Quality and Durability

Kraft paper is crafted from 100% recycled or sustainably sourced wood pulp, providing a sturdy alternative to traditional wrapping paper. Its natural texture can withstand folding and creasing without tearing, though it may not be suitable for extremely heavy items. Look for a thickness of at least 22 lb for standard wrapping tasks. 


### Printing and Design Options

Unlike traditional wrapping paper, kraft options typically offer a natural unprinted surface that displays handwritten messages and simple stamps effectively. For those who prefer added decoration, consider patterns that complement the paper's texture, such as twine designs or natural motifs. The design should enhance rather than overwhelm the paper's rustic appeal. 


### Eco-Friendly Features

When selecting kraft wrapping paper, verify that it contains a high percentage of recycled content and is itself recyclable after use. Some premium options are even certified by environmental organizations, ensuring both your waste reduction efforts and your paper choices align with sustainable practices. 


### Value and Cost Considerations

While kraft wrapping paper generally costs less than traditional options, consider the square footage and quality when comparing prices. A roll that measures 36 inches by 500 feet offers extensive coverage for most gift-giving needs. The durability of the paper may also reduce overall costs by extending its usable life compared to thinner alternatives. 


## FAQ


### What is kraft wrapping paper made of?

Kraft wrapping paper is made from 100% virgin wood pulp, which gives it its distinctive brown color and natural texture. The paper is uncoated and untreated, making it more environmentally friendly compared to traditional wrapping papers. 

The manufacturing process uses a sulfur-free method, which results in a strong paper with good printability. This paper type can be recycled after use, making it a sustainable choice for gift-giving. 


### How should kraft wrapping paper be stored?

Store kraft wrapping paper in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture. The ideal temperature range is between 15-25°C (59-77°F). Proper storage will maintain the paper's quality and prevent damage. 

If storing for an extended period, roll the paper around a cardboard tube to prevent static and creasing. Keep the tube slightly smaller than the paper roll to prevent crushing. 


### What are the environmental benefits of kraft wrapping paper?

Unlike traditional wrapping paper, kraft paper is made from sustainable wood sources and is chlorine-free. This reduces its environmental impact during production. The uncoated paper also requires fewer resources for manufacturing. 

After use, kraft wrapping paper can be recycled, whereas many coated papers end up in landfills. The paper's natural properties make it more biodegradable, further reducing its environmental footprint. 


### Can kraft wrapping paper be re-used?

Yes, kraft wrapping paper can be reused for various purposes. The paper's natural texture and slightly rough surface make it suitable for multiple wrapping uses. It can also be used for gift tags, notes, or other paper crafts. 

When reusing, consider the paper's condition and intended use. For repeated wrapping, use areas with less print or design. The paper works well for casual gifts where appearance is secondary to functionality. 


### What printing options are available for kraft wrapping paper?

Kraft wrapping paper prints well with both laser and inkjet printers. The paper's texture allows for crisp, clear prints, though designs may show slight texture variations. For best results, use print settings that account for the paper's thickness. 

Specialty printers may offer enhanced options for kraft paper, such as UV coating for improved durability. Always test print on a small piece before committing to a full print job. 


### How should kraft wrapping paper be wrapped?

Begin by trimming the paper to the desired length, allowing extra width for wrapping and securing. Fold the paper in half lengthwise and place the gift in the center. Wrap the paper around the gift, tucking in the edges as you go. Fold any remaining paper under and secure with twine or tape. 

For extra stability, consider using acid-free tape or brown paper tape. Secure any loose edges and trim any excess paper before presenting the gift.
