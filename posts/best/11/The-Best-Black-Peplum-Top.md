### What occasions are black peplum tops appropriate for?

For formal events, consider pairing a black peplum top with a little black dress or formal pants. For work, layer it under a blazer with dress pants or a pencil skirt. For casual wear, team it with skinny jeans or leggings. 


### How should I care for a black peplum top?

Most black peplum tops require basic laundering. Check the care label for specific instructions, but typically, they can be machine-washed in cold water on the gentle cycle. Avoid bleach and harsh detergents that may damage the fabric. 

Air drying is recommended to maintain the peplum's shape. If ironing is needed, use a low heat setting and press from the back side to avoid melting any pleats or gathering.

### What are the sizing considerations for black peplum tops?

Peplum tops tend to be true to size, with slight variations based on the brand. The key measurements to check are chest circumference and waist measurement, as the peplum typically doesn't affect the overall fit significantly. 

Consider your body type when selecting a size. Those with wider hips might prefer a slightly larger size in the peplum top to achieve the desired silhouette. Always compare measurements to the manufacturer's sizing chart for the most accurate fit. 


### How can I style a black peplum top?

Black peplum tops pair well with a variety of bottoms, from high-waisted pants to pencil skirts. Create contrast with a bright-colored bottom or keep it simple with solid black pants or skirt. 

Accessories can enhance your outfit. Consider statement jewelry, a structured handbag, or heels for a complete look. Alternatively, you can wear the top with ankle boots and tights for a more casual outfit.
