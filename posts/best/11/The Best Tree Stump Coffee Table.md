## Buyer's Guide

A tree stump coffee table brings a rustic, natural element to any room while providing a practical surface for drinks and snacks. These unique pieces combine functionality with organic design, making them a distinctive addition to living rooms, patios, or gardens. 


### Size and Proportion

The stump's dimensions should complement your available space. Measure your seating arrangement and room dimensions before selecting a size. Consider the table's height relative to nearby furniture - it should sit comfortably between your couch and armchair. 


### Maintenance Requirements

Rustic materials like untreated wood need more maintenance than finished surfaces. Check if the supplier offers protective covering or preservative treatments. Consider the exposure level - outdoor stumps will require more diligent care than indoor pieces. 


### Stump Stability

Ensure the table's base is wide enough to prevent tipping, especially with heavy items. Top-heavy designs may need additional base reinforcement. Some manufacturers add metal supports or concrete cores for extra stability. 


### Finish and Seating Options

Unfinished stumps require regular sealing and sealing maintenance. Finished versions come in various natural and artificial wood looks. Look for options that allow adding bench seating above the stump, creating additional seating while keeping the main surface clear.
