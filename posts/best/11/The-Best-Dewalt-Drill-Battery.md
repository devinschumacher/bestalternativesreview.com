## Buyer's Guide

Dewalt drill batteries power your cordless drilling needs with reliable performance. When choosing a Dewalt drill battery, consider a few key factors to find the right balance of power, runtime, and compatibility. 


### Capacity and Runtime

Battery capacity measures how much energy it can store. Higher capacity means longer runtime between charges. Most Dewalt drill batteries offer 2.0Ah to 3.0Ah capacities, which provide 15-20 minutes of runtime for standard drilling tasks. 

![Dewalt-Drill-Battery-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Dewalt-Drill-Battery-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Voltage and Performance

Standard Dewalt drill batteries operate at 18V. The voltage determines motor performance - higher voltage typically means more power and faster speeds. Modern 18V batteries balance power with portability and runtime. 


### Compatibility and System Requirements

Ensure your drill and battery are part of the same Dewalt battery system (e. g. 18V Max or XRP). Check if your drill takes single or double battery packs. Dewalt's Click-Tight system makes quick battery changes simple.
