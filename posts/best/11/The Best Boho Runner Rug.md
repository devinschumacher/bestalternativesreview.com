## Buyer's Guide

Boho runner rugs combine warm hospitality with natural elements, perfect for grounding your living space. These versatile rugs layer beautifully with bohemian decor while providing practical warmth underfoot. 


### Size and Space

Measure your intended space to determine the appropriate runner length. Common lengths range from 2 to 9 feet, with wider options available for larger entryways or seating areas. Consider the room's flow when positioning your rug - leave about 12-18 inches of clear space around the edges for traffic flow. 


### Material and Texture

BOHO runner rugs often feature natural fibers like jute, cotton, or wool for their organic feel. Jute offers affordability and durability, while cotton provides a softer texture. Wool adds warmth and resilience but requires more maintenance. Mix textures by layering a chunky wool rug with a lighter cotton throw. 


### Color and Pattern

These rugs frequently incorporate earthy tones and free-form patterns inspired by global textiles. Look for complementary colors that enhance your existing decor while adding warmth. Patterns with bold lines or large motifs create visual interest, while subtle designs offer a more understated look. 


### Maintenance Requirements

Natural fiber rugs like jute and wool need regular cleaning to maintain their appearance and durability. Vacuum weekly to remove loose dirt and dust, and spot clean stains promptly. Wool requires professional cleaning every 12-18 months to prevent moisture damage. Consider the maintenance needs when selecting a material and positioning your rug. 


## FAQ


### What is a boho runner rug?

A boho runner rug combines elements of boho-chic styling with practical functionality. These rugs feature rich textures, natural materials, and earthy color palettes, perfect for adding warmth and texture to living spaces. 

The "runner" aspect comes from their elongated shape, typically measuring 2 to 3 feet wide and 7 to 9 feet long. This length makes them ideal for hallways, entryways, or as a main floor rug in small to medium rooms. 


### What materials are commonly used in boho runner rugs?

These rugs often incorporate natural fibers like jute, cotton, and wool. Jute provides a durable foundation with a natural earthy tone, while cotton adds softness and versatility in color options. Wool brings warmth and durability, making it ideal for high-traffic areas. 

Some runners also feature blended materials, combining the benefits of multiple fibers for enhanced performance and appearance. 


### How should boho runner rugs be maintained?

Regular maintenance keeps your boho runner looking its best. Vacuum the rug weekly with a brush attachment to remove loose dust and debris. For spills, blot the area immediately with a clean cloth, avoiding rubbing which can damage the fibers. 

Professional cleaning may be necessary for heavily soiled areas. If you opt for professional cleaning, choose a service that specializes in natural fiber rugs to preserve the integrity of your piece. 


### Can boho runner rugs be machine washed?

Synthetic fiber runners made specifically for machine washing can be cleaned this way. For natural fiber rugs, particularly those with loose fringe or intricate detailing, it's best to hand wash or use a professional service designed for delicate rugs. 

If you decide to machine wash, use a gentle cycle and a mild detergent. Avoid bleach or fabric softeners, as these can damage natural fibers and reduce the rug's lifespan. 


### What sizes are available for boho runner rugs?

Standard boho runner rugs measure 2 to 3 feet wide by 7 to 9 feet long, but custom sizes can be ordered. This length makes them ideal for entryways, hallways, or as a main floor rug in small to medium rooms. 

Some manufacturers offer runners in additional lengths or widths, so if you need a specific size, check with your retailer for availability. 


### How do I choose the right color for my boho runner rug?

Selecting the right color depends on your room's existing color scheme. Boho runners typically feature earthy tones like neutral beige, rich brown, or soft cream, which complement most interior styles. 

Consider the natural light in your room to choose colors that will look best with your existing furnishings and window treatments.
