## FAQ

![Chebe-Oil-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Chebe-Oil-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is Chebe Oil?

Chebe oil is a natural hair treatment made from the seeds of the Jatropha tree. Extracted through cold pressing, it retains the beneficial properties of the plant, making it popular among natural hair enthusiasts. 

The oil helps to moisturize, prevent breakage, and promote hair growth without using harsh chemicals found in many conventional hair products. 


### Is Chebe Oil Safe for All Hair Types?

Chebe oil is generally safe for all hair types, including curly, straight, and fine hair. However, people with scalp conditions like dandruff or eczema should perform a patch test first to ensure no adverse reactions. 

It's particularly beneficial for dry, damaged hair and those with natural hair texture, as it provides deep conditioning and detangling properties. 

![Chebe-Oil-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Chebe-Oil-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How Should Chebe Oil Be Stored?

Chebe oil should be stored in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight to maintain its quality and shelf life. Since it's a natural product, refrigeration can extend its shelf life and prevent oxidation. 

Unopened bottles typically last up to 2 years, while opened bottles should be used within 6 months to one year for optimal effectiveness. 


### What are the Ideal Usage Guidelines?

Apply a small amount to clean, damp hair after washing, focusing on the ends and mid-lengths. Gently massage it into your scalp and hair, then leave it on for 30 minutes to an hour before rinsing. Regular use, 1-2 times per week, can lead to noticeable improvements in hair health. 

For best results, combine it with heat through the use of a hot towel or hair dryer to activate its properties. Can be used as a pre-shampoo treatment or as a deep conditioning mask. 

![Chebe-Oil-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Chebe-Oil-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Does Chebe Oil have Any Specific Benefits?

In addition to general hair conditioning, Chebe oil helps reduce frizz, improves shine, and protects hair from environmental damage due to its natural antioxidants. It also promotes scalp health and can aid in reducing hair loss when used regularly. 

Many users report improved regrowth in thinning hair areas, though results may vary. The oil helps strengthen the hair shaft, making it less prone to breakage and split ends. 


### Can Chebe Oil be Used with Other Hair Products?

Chebe oil works well with most other hair products and can enhance their effectiveness. Apply it alone as a basic treatment or combine with your regular shampoo, conditioner, and styling products for added benefits. 

However, avoid mixing it with strong chemical products or hot oil treatments, as these can neutralize its natural properties and damage your hair. Always perform a patch test with new products to check for compatibility.
