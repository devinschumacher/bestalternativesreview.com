## FAQ


### What types of dog treats does Nutro offer?

Nutro offers a variety of dog treat options, including grain-free, grain-inclusive, and specialized formula treats. The company's grain-free treats feature ingredients like sweet potato, pea fiber, and tapioca, while grain-inclusive treats contain traditional ingredients like oats and brown rice. Specialized formula treats target specific needs, such as joint health, digestive support, and mental stimulation. 

These treats come in various forms, including bars, biscuits, and edible toys, allowing pet owners to choose based on their dog's preferences and dietary requirements. 


### What are the nutritional benefits of Nutro treats?

Nutro treats prioritize natural ingredients with minimal processing. Their grain-free treats contain no artificial flavors, colors, or preservatives, focusing instead on whole-food ingredients like real chicken, turkey, or salmon. These treats help maintain a balanced diet between meals and provide essential vitamins and minerals. 

Their grain-inclusive treats offer a similar nutrition profile, with added benefits for dogs who require carbohydrates in their diet. Specialized formula treats incorporate specific ingredients like glucosamine and chondroitin for joint health or probiotics for digestive support, addressing additional nutritional needs. 


### Do Nutro treats have any allergen information?

Nutro clearly labels allergens on their treat packages, making it easy for pet owners to identify potential triggers. The grain-free treats typically list common allergens like dairy and eggs, while grain-inclusive treats highlight potential grain allergens. Specialized formula treats clearly identify any additional ingredients that could be allergens for certain dogs. 

For detailed allergen information, including specific ingredient sourcing, pet owners should review the product labels carefully or contact Nutro's customer service directly. 


### Are Nutro treats suitable for all breeds and sizes?

Nutro treats are generally safe for all dog breeds and sizes, with appropriate sizes available for small, medium, and large dogs. Their grain-free treats come in four size options to accommodate different pet weight ranges, ensuring proper portion control and prevent over-snacking. 

While most dogs can enjoy Nutro treats, pet owners should monitor their dog's reaction, especially when introducing new treats. Small dogs or those with specific dietary restrictions may need to stick with grain-free or grain-inclusive options to avoid potential digestive issues. 


### How long do Nutro treats retain their freshness?

Nutro treats maintain their freshness for up to 12 months when stored properly. For optimal shelf life, keep treats in their original packaging and store them in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Once opened, transfer remaining treats to an airtight container to prevent exposure to air and moisture, which can degrade their quality. 

Always check treat packaging dates and inspect treats for any signs of spoilage before giving them to your dog. If treats show signs of mold, off odors, or unusual texture changes, discard them immediately to ensure your dog's safety. 


### Can Nutro treats be given regularly as part of a dog's diet?

Nutro treats can be given regularly as a small part of your dog's diet, making up no more than 10% of their daily calorie intake. The company recommends limiting treat consumption to prevent weight gain and maintain proper nutrition balance. For dogs with specific dietary requirements or health conditions, consult with your veterinarian before incorporating Nutro treats into their diet. 

When introducing new treats, monitor your dog's reaction and adjust the portion size as needed. Some dogs may need fewer treats to maintain a healthy weight, while others might be able to enjoy treats more frequently without issues.
