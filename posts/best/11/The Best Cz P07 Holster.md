The CZ P07 is a popular compact pistol, and finding the right holster can significantly impact your carry experience. This guide outlines key considerations for P07 holsters, helping you choose a holster that is both practical and comfortable.

### Retention Features

Consider holsters with positive retention features like double retention clips or thumb-break lever closures. These features help prevent accidental discharge while allowing for quick draw when needed. 


### Ergonomics and Comfort

Choose a holster with padding, especially if you plan to carry with your concealed carry holster (CCW) rig. Properly padded holsters reduce pressure points and improve comfort during extended carry.

![Cz-P07-Holster-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cz-P07-Holster-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is the Cz P07 holster compatible with?

The Cz P07 holster is specifically designed for the Cz P07 compact pistol. It features a secure retention clip and ambidextrous thumb break for easy right or left-handed draw. The holster is not compatible with other firearm models. 

Compatible accessories include belt clips for various belt thicknesses and magazine carriers. The holster's retention levels can be adjusted for different carry preferences and firearm models within the same family. 


### How do I properly attach the holster to my belt?

The holster attaches to your belt through a strong clip mechanism. Align the clip with your belt type (1.5" or 1.75") and press it firmly into place. Make sure the clip locks securely to prevent accidental holster detachment. 

For optimal comfort and security, position the holster at your waist level with the pistol facing down towards your heel. Adjust your belt positioning to accommodate the holster's height and clip size.

### What are the retention levels for the Cz P07 holster?

The holster offers three retention levels, allowing you to adjust the secureness of the pistol's grip. Level 1 provides the most accessible draw, while Level 3 offers the highest level of retention, suitable for concealed carry. 

The retention level can be adjusted using the thumb break mechanism. The thumb break controls the tension on the retention clip, allowing you to find the perfect balance between accessibility and security for your carry preference. 


### Can the holster be worn on the inside or outside of the pants?

The Cz P07 holster can be worn both on the inside and outside of your pants. For inside-the-pants carry, use the included belt clip with an appropriate holster retention strap. For outside-the-pants carry, use the clip with your standard belt. 

When wearing the holster inside the pants, ensure you use a holster retention strap to prevent the holster from sliding down. The retention strap should be adjusted to maintain the holster's position while allowing for easy access.
