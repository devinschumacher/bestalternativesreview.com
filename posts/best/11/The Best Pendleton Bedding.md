## Buyer's Guide

The Pendleton Bedding collection combines heritage craftsmanship with versatile designs, offering both warmth and style for your sleep space. Understanding the key aspects of this bedding range will help you make an informed choice that matches your needs and preferences. 


### Material Quality and Care

Pendleton's bedding is known for its durability and comfort, featuring high-quality materials that range from soft cotton to elegant wool blends. Look for detailed information on fabric composition and weight to ensure the bedding feels right for your sleep environment. Additionally, consider the care requirements, as some blends may need specific washing instructions to maintain their quality. 


### Size and Fit

Proper sizing ensures your bedding provides adequate coverage and prevents shifting during the night. Standard bedding sets typically include a fitted sheet, flat sheet, and pillowcases. For a complete look, coordinate with your mattress size (twin, full, queen, king) and consider whether you prefer a standard or deep-pocket sheet. 


### Pattern and Color Selection

The Pendleton aesthetic shines through in its distinctive patterns and rich colorways. Consider whether you prefer classic plaids and stripes or more modern graphics. The scale of the pattern can affect how a room feels - smaller prints work well in smaller spaces, while larger designs create a bolder statement. 


### Layering and Temperature Control

Quality bedding should allow you to layer effectively for temperature regulation. Consider the weight and warmth rating of the materials, especially if you share a bed or have varying body temperature needs. Many Pendleton pieces transition well from seasons, making them a practical choice for changing weather conditions. 


## FAQ


### What makes Pendleton bedding unique?

Pendleton bedding combines durable construction with rich, authentic color that deepens over time, creating a patina that only enhances their beauty. Each piece is crafted from premium-quality, long-staple cotton that resists pill formation and maintains its shape. 

The collection features traditional patterns with modern takes, allowing you to blend classic and contemporary elements in your bedroom decor. From duvet covers to throw pillows, every item is designed to stand the test of time while becoming increasingly valuable with use. 


### How should I care for my Pendleton bedding?

These bedding items should be washed in a warm, gentle cycle using mild detergent. Always wash similar colors together and avoid bleach, which can damage the fabrics. After washing, tumble dry on low or air dry to maintain the integrity of the materials. 

Regularly shake out your bedding to restore its shape and prevent clumping. Use a protective mattress cover to extend the life of your bedding and keep your mattress free from allergens and dust mites. 


### Can I mix Pendleton bedding with my existing linens?

While Pendleton bedding pairs exceptionally well with similar quality linens, you can certainly mix it with other high-thread-count cottons. The classic patterns and neutral colors make them versatile enough to complement various bedding styles and color schemes. 

Just keep an eye on color matching, especially when adding new pieces. Because Pendleton fabric tends to deepen in color over time, you might notice subtle shifts that affect the overall appearance of your bedding set. 


### What are the dimensions of Pendleton sheets?

Pendleton sheets come in standard bed sizes: Twin, Full, Queen, King, and California King. It's important to note that the weave and shrinkage during washing can affect the final dimensions, so measuring your mattress before purchasing is recommended. 

For best results, use a measuring tape to determine your mattress's actual length and width. This will help you find sheets that provide ample coverage while maintaining the proper fit under your mattress. 


### Are Pendleton bedding sets available in twin size?

Yes, Pendleton offers bedding sets in twin size, as well as twin XL for rooms with wider beds. The twin set typically consists of a fitted sheet, flat sheet, and pillow cases, though some sets may include an additional decorative pillow. 

Twin bedding pairs particularly well with shared sleeping spaces, smaller rooms, or when you prefer not to cover an entire bed. These sets often provide just the right balance of warmth and coziness for a single person or a small couple. 


### What sizes are available for the Pendleton duvet covers?

Pendleton offers a variety of duvet cover sizes to fit different mattress types: Twin, Full/Queen, King, and California King. The duvet covers are available in three different lengths - standard, long, and super long - to accommodate various mattress depths. 

When selecting a duvet cover, measure your mattress's length and depth to ensure a proper fit. Remember that longer duvet covers can create a more luxurious look while providing extra warmth, though they require a bit more maintenance to keep the ends tucked in.
