### [First Edition: Tropic of Capricorn by Henry Miller](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Tropic+Of+Capricorn+Book?utm\_term=first-edition-tropic-of-capricorn-by-henry-miller)

First published in 1964 by Calder Publications Ltd. , this hardcover edition of "Tropic of Capricorn" presents a sun-weathered narrative through its red-jacketed pages. The book itself maintains its structural integrity with only minor signs of age—some foxing and tanning along the edges—while the gilt lettering on the cloth boards remains strikingly clear. The dust jacket, though showing its age with chipping and sunning, still hints at the adventure that lies within these 316 pages.
