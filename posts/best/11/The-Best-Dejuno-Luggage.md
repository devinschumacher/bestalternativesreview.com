The largest one can pack a lot of clothes, but I wish there were more pockets inside to keep things organized. The black finish looks sharp and protects well when you're walking through the airport.

## FAQ


### What makes Dejuno luggage different from other travel bags?

Dejuno luggage stands out with its patented Expandable Flexi-Shaped™ design that allows the bag to expand and contract based on your packing needs. This innovative shape also makes it easier to navigate through airport security and find your bag in the carousel. 

The company focuses on durability and functionality, using reinforced stitching and water-resistant materials in their bags. Their line includes both hard-sided and soft-sided options to suit different packing preferences and travel styles. 


### Are Dejuno bags suitable for carry-on or checked luggage?

Dejuno offers both carry-on and checked luggage options. Their expandable design makes it easier to meet airline carry-on size restrictions while providing enough space for a full week's worth of clothes. For checked luggage, their hard-sided bags maintain their shape and protect your belongings during transit. 

Check with your specific airline for current carry-on size requirements, as they can change. Dejuno bags typically meet most standard carry-on dimensions. 


### How does the Expandable Flexi-Shaped™ design work?

The Expandable Flexi-Shaped™ design allows the bag to expand outward from its base, providing additional space for clothing and personal items. When you're finished packing, simply push the sides back in for optimal storage and to maintain its shape during travel. 

This design feature helps prevent bulging and ensures the bag remains stable during transport. It also allows the bag to expand in multiple directions, not just lengthwise, giving you more space for your belongings. 


### What types of materials are used in Dejuno bags?

Dejuno bags incorporate a blend of durable materials, including water-resistant polyester and reinforced stitching. Their hard-sided luggage features polycarbonate construction with aluminum corners for added protection. 

For soft-sided bags, they use reinforced 600D polyester with padded back panels and shoulder straps. The zippers are high-quality YKK zipper for smooth operation and longevity. 


### Can Dejuno bags fit all types of clothing?

The Expandable Flexi-Shaped™ design accommodates various clothing items, from casual wear to formal attire. You can fit most standard clothing items, including jeans, t-shirts, dresses, and jackets. 

For bulky items like winter coats or formal wear, you may need to roll or compress them to fit. Dejuno recommends packing similar types of clothing together to ensure the bag remains organized and efficient. 


### What is the warranty coverage for Dejuno luggage?

Dejuno offers a comprehensive warranty that covers manufacturing defects for the lifetime of the bag. This includes issues with zippers, hardware, and stitching. 

If you encounter any problems with your Dejuno bag within the warranty period, you can return it to their authorized repair center for free service. For products purchased before the current warranty period, the company typically provides one year of coverage.
