## Buyer's Guide

11x17 paper offers a generous format for creating detailed drawings, printing, and mounting. This guide helps you choose the right type, weight, and size to suit your specific needs. 


### Available Sizes and Types

The standard 11x17 paper size makes efficient use of space for expanding graphics or multiple smaller prints. Options include single sheets for individual projects or pads for sketching and drafting. 

![11x17-Paper-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/11x17-Paper-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Paper Weights

Medium weight (20-24 lb) works well for quick sketches and writing. Heavier weights (28-32 lb) provide better surface texture and resistance to folding, ideal for finished artwork and printing. 


### Surface Quality

Colegial surfaces create smoother lines with pens and pencils but feel less substantial. Textured surfaces enhance grip for pressure-sensitive tools and provide better tooth for media like charcoal and pastels. 

![11x17-Paper-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/11x17-Paper-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Printability

Standard weight paper works fine for most office printers. Professional graphics require laser printers or high-quality photo printers compatible with 11x17 media. Consider the print's intended use: office documents on standard paper, professional prints on heavier, more durable stock. 


## FAQ

![11x17-Paper-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/11x17-Paper-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is 11x17 paper?

11x17 paper, also known as tabloid size, measures 17 inches by 11 inches. It's slightly larger than legal paper (8.5x14 inches). 

Common uses include architectural drawings, technical diagrams, and large prints. Its size makes it ideal for presentations and publications where extra space is needed. 


### What paper weights are available?

Standard weights range from 20 to 65 lb (90 to 289 g/m²). Heavier weights (24-32 lb) are suitable for printing, while lighter weights (20-22 lb) are better for writing and sketching. 

Specialty papers like vellum and cardstock are also available in 11x17 sizes, suitable for creative projects and mounting. 

![11x17-Paper-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/11x17-Paper-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What surface finishes are available?

Glossy coatings enhance print quality and durability but can be slippery. Matte finishes preserve text readability while preventing fingerprints. 

Mulberry finishes offer a natural look with texture, while cotton papers provide a traditional feel for fine arts applications. 


### What margin sizes are recommended?

The standard North American margin is 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) on all sides. This ensures easy handling and alignment for printers and bindings. 

Professional layouts may require generous margins (1-1.5 inches) for safety and improved readability in bound documents. 

![11x17-Paper-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/11x17-Paper-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What printing requirements should I consider?

Printers typically require 0.125 to 0.25 inch (3-6 mm) extra space around the edges for feed mechanisms. Check your printer's specifications for precise requirements. 

For laser printers, use 11x17 paper with a slightly larger print area to prevent white borders. Inkjet printers can handle standard 11x17 paper without adjustments. 


### What should I consider when purchasing bulk quantities?

Consider the intended use and storage space when selecting quantities. Larger sheets may be more practical for occasional use, while dedicated professionals might prefer organized storage systems for multiple sheets. 

Look for bulk purchase options that include value-added benefits like free shipping or rebates for high-volume orders.
