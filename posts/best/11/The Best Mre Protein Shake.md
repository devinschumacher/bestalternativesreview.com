## FAQ


### What is an MRE protein shake?

An MRE protein shake is a nutritionally complete meal replacement that combines proteins, carbohydrates, and fats in a convenient shake form. The acronym "MRE" stands for Meal, Ready-to-Eat, drawing from military provisions but adapted for civilian food consumption. 

These shakes typically offer balanced macronutrient profiles and sometimes include vitamins and minerals, making them a versatile choice for meal replacement or dietary support. 


### What ingredients should I look for in an MRE protein shake?

Opt for formulas containing a blend of proteins like whey, casein, and plant-based options such as pea or hemp. Look for added benefits like fiber, essential vitamins, and minerals. The ingredient list should also include real-food sources rather than artificial additives. 

Avoid products with high sugar content, artificial sweeteners, or excessive processed ingredients. The nutrition facts label should support your dietary goals, whether you're managing weight, building muscle, or maintaining general health. 


### How much protein should I consume per shake?

Most MRE protein shakes range between 20-30 grams of protein per serving. Athletes and bodybuilders may benefit from higher protein intake, while casual users should choose the standard serving size. 

Follow the manufacturer's recommended serving size to ensure proper nutrition without excessive calorie intake. Consult with a nutritionist if you have specific dietary requirements or goals. 


### Are MRE protein shakes suitable for vegetarians and vegans?

Many MRE protein shakes offer both animal and plant-based options. Look for formulas that specify "vegetarian" or "vegan" to meet your dietary restrictions. Some may use dairy alternatives like soy or almond milk as the base. 

Check the ingredient list for animal-derived components and ensure the product is certified vegetarian or vegan if this is important to your dietary choices. 


### How should I store MRE protein shakes?

Most MRE protein shakes have a shelf life of several months to a year, depending on the brand and packaging. Keep unopened containers in a cool, dry place or pantry. 

After opening, store the shake in the refrigerator and consume within a week for optimal freshness and safety. 


### Can MRE protein shakes be customized?

Bulk formulas often include customizable options like the ability to mix in your own milk, water, or additional ingredients. This allows for flexibility based on your nutritional needs or preferences. 

Some specialized blends may offer nutritional adjustments through different serving sizes or component selections. Always check the product instructions for customization options and proper preparation methods.
