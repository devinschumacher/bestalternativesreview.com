### Flavors and Varieties

Misodensho come in various strengths (from mild to very salty) and flavors like traditional white miso, red miso, and yellow miso. Some blends include seaweed, chicken stock, or other ingredients for specific tastes. 


### Quality and Production

Check if the packets use high-quality organic ingredients and traditional fermentation methods. The production date and shelf life are important for freshness, as miso should be used within a few months after opening.

### Usage and Storage

Water temperature affects miso's flavor and texture, so it's best dissolved in warm (not hot) water. Store opened packets in the refrigerator and use within a week. Unopened packets keep well at room temperature for several months. 


## FAQ
