## FAQ

![Scratch-Book-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Scratch-Book-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What exactly is a scratch book?

A scratch book is a decorative surface with a protective coating that's designed to be partially revealed, typically through scratching. This coating can be made from various materials, including foil, paper, or holographic textures. 

When a scratch book's surface is scratched, it reveals an underlying design or message underneath the protective layer. This type of interactive design makes scratch books popular for revealing surprises, messages, or patterns. 


### What are the main types of scratch books?

Common types include foil scratch books, holographic scratch books, and paper scratch books. Each type offers different visual effects and levels of interaction depending on the material used for the protective coating. 

Foil scratch books provide a metallic sheen, holographic scratch books reveal 3D patterns, and paper scratch books offer traditional white or colored backgrounds with various designs printed below the surface. 

![Scratch-Book-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Scratch-Book-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the best uses for scratch books?

Scratch books are popular for creating interactive displays, greeting cards, and promotional materials. They're also commonly used in craft projects, home decor, and as educational tools for revealing facts or concepts. 

Businesses often use scratch books for trade shows, marketing materials, and customer engagement. DIY enthusiasts and crafters use them for home decor projects, journals, and homemade greeting cards. 


### How durable are scratch books?

Scratch books can vary significantly in durability depending on their construction and environment. Properly protected scratch books can last for years, especially when sealed with a clear coat or mounted in protective frames. 

Exposure to moisture, extreme temperatures, or frequent scratching can affect their longevity. For optimal durability, follow the manufacturer's care instructions and display scratch books in protected environments when possible. 

![Scratch-Book-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Scratch-Book-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can scratch books be reused?

Scratch books are generally not reusable once the protective coating is fully exposed. The coating is designed to reveal the underlying design through a single scratching action, after which it cannot be restored to its original state. 

Some reusable scratch book concepts exist, such as electronic scratch cards or self-healing coatings, but traditional scratch books are intended for one-time use to reveal their designs. 


### Are scratch books suitable for all ages?

Scratch books are generally considered safe and appropriate for all ages, as they pose no significant health or safety risks. The primary considerations are the size of the scratchable areas and the material used for the protective coating. 

Parents or supervisors may want to ensure the scratch book's design elements are appropriate for the intended age group, especially if the book contains small parts that could be swallowed or sharp edges that might be hazardous.
