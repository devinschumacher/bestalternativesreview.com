## FAQ


### What are essential oils?

Essential oils are concentrated plant extracts distilled from flowers, fruits, leaves, bark, and other plant parts. Each oil carries unique properties and aromas, making them popular for aromatherapy, skincare, and household cleaning. 

These natural oils are known for their potent medicinal properties and are commonly used to promote relaxation, enhance mood, and support overall well-being. 


### What is the difference between therapeutic and carrier oils?

Therapeutic oils, like peppermint and eucalyptus, are used for their specific healing properties and can be applied directly to the skin in small amounts for therapeutic benefits. 

Carrier oils, such as sweet almond and avocado oil, are used to dilute essential oils for safe application. They help prevent skin irritation and ensure even distribution of the therapeutic properties. 


### How do essential oils work?

When inhaled, essential oils stimulate the olfactory system, which sends signals to the limbic system in the brain, affecting emotions and memories. This is why certain scents can instantly evoke specific feelings or memories. 

When applied topically, essential oils are absorbed through the skin and enter the bloodstream, where they can affect various bodily systems and promote healing. 


### Which essential oils are safe for children?

Young children's skin is more sensitive, so only use diluted essential oils and always perform a patch test before larger applications. Safe options include lavender, chamomile, and frankincense. 

Always supervise young children when using essential oils, and consult with a healthcare provider before using any essential oils near children under 3 years old. 


### How should essential oils be stored?

Keep essential oils in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight, which can degrade their quality. Store them in glass containers with tight lids to prevent evaporation and contamination. 

Label each bottle clearly to avoid confusion and use within their recommended shelf life, typically 3-5 years under proper storage conditions. 


### Can essential oils be used internally?

Essential oils should never be ingested undiluted. Some oils may be used in very small amounts under professional supervision for specific health conditions, but this must be done with extreme caution. 

Always keep essential oils away from children and pets, as ingestion, accidental exposure, or misuse can lead to serious health risks.
