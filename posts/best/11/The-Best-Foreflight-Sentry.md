## Buyer's Guide

The Foreflight Sentry is designed to protect digital flight planning data, and choosing the right model involves considering several key factors. This guide outlines important features and considerations to help you select the most suitable Sentry device for your aviation needs. 


### Form Factor and Mounting Options

Sentry models vary in size and mounting capabilities. The smaller versions offer discreet installation in instrument panels, while larger models provide more space for additional accessories. Consider the available mounting locations in your aircraft and whether you need multiple devices for different areas. 


### Power Source Compatibility

Foreflight Sentry devices can operate on both 12V and 24V systems, making them adaptable to various aircraft electrical configurations. Some models include built-in power switching mechanisms, while others require external switches. Understanding your aircraft's power system is crucial for proper device integration. 


### Data Storage and Transfer

The amount of storage varies between Sentry models, with options ranging from basic file storage to professional-grade data management. Consider whether you need frequent data backups, external storage capabilities, or built-in Wi-Fi for cloud syncing. The transfer speed and method (USB, SD card, or wireless) also impact data management efficiency. 


### Software Features and Updates

While all Sentry devices run Foreflight software, the degree of functionality varies by model. Some versions include advanced features like weather plotting tools or specialized navigation capabilities. Regular software updates are important for maintaining the latest security protocols and feature improvements, so ensure your chosen model receives ongoing support. 


## FAQ


### What is Foreflight Sentry?

Foreflight Sentry is a suite of safety features designed to enhance situational awareness, navigation, and communication during VFR (Visual Flight Rules) operations. These features integrate with Foreflight Mobile and Foreflight Flight Deck applications to provide valuable tools for pilots. 

Key Sentry features include GPS tracking, automated emergency messaging, and weather information overlay, all of which aim to improve flight safety by providing real-time data and alerts. 


### How does it compare to ADS-B In capabilities?

While ADS-B IN provides traffic and weather information broadcast directly from aircraft with ADS-B Out systems, Foreflight Sentry enhances VFR flight safety through GPS tracking and automated communications. Sentry's features complement ADS-B capabilities, offering additional safety benefits particularly relevant to VFR operations where ADS-B coverage may be limited. 

The two systems work together to create a more complete picture of airspace activity, with ADS-B IN providing real-time traffic data and Sentry offering enhanced situational awareness through tracking and messaging capabilities. 


### Who requires Foreflight Sentry?

Foreflight Sentry is recommended for all pilots operating under VFR conditions, particularly those using Foreflight Mobile or Foreflight Flight Deck applications. The system enhances basic VFR flight operations by providing additional safety features that are especially valuable in areas with limited technology infrastructure. 

It's important to note that no equipment requirements are mandated by regulatory authorities. However, the decision to invest in Sentry should be based on the specific flying environment and personal safety considerations of each pilot. 


### What are the technical requirements?

To use Foreflight Sentry, you'll need a compatible device running the latest version of Foreflight Mobile or Foreflight Flight Deck, as well as an active Foreflight subscription. The system requires an internet connection for some features and supports both cellular and Wi-Fi networks. 

The minimum hardware requirements include a device with a modern processor and sufficient storage for the Foreflight application and its data. The system is compatible with smartphones and tablets running iOS or Android operating systems. 


### Are there any costs associated with Foreflight Sentry?

Foreflight Sentry is included in the subscription fees for Foreflight Mobile and Foreflight Flight Deck. You'll need an active subscription to access the system's features, which typically require a monthly or annual fee depending on your plan selection. 

The cost of Sentry itself is already factored into your subscription price. Additional costs may apply for optional premium features or expanded service areas, which can be managed through your subscription settings. 


### How do I enable and use Foreflight Sentry features?

Enabling Sentry features requires updating your Foreflight application to the latest version and selecting your aircraft's registration and type in the settings menu. Once enabled, Sentry features will automatically collect and transmit your flight data. 

To access Sentry information, open your Foreflight application during flight and select the appropriate display for tracking, weather overlays, or emergency messaging. The system's features will work automatically based on your subscription and device capabilities.
