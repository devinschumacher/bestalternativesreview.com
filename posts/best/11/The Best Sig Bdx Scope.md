### Reticle Options

Reticles vary between models, with options including standard BDX patterns, mil-dot configurations, and dedicated hunting designs. Consider your primary shooting discipline - hunting, tactical, or long-range shooting - to select the most appropriate reticle. 


### Ergonomics and Mounting

Both the 3-9x and 3-18x models share similar ergonomics, featuring a low profile design that reduces snagging during carry. The scope requires a 30mm objective bell, which affects overall length and mounting compatibility. Ensure your rifle setup can accommodate the chosen scope size.
