## Buyer's Guide

Easton baseball gloves combine durable construction with ergonomic designs to help players of all skill levels perform their best. When selecting an Easton glove, consider several key factors to find one that fits your position, playing style, and performance needs. 


### Position-Specific Requirements

Fielding position significantly influences glove choice. Infield gloves typically feature shorter patterns (10.5-11.5 inches) with softer leather for quicker reaction times. Outfield gloves usually have longer patterns (11-12 inches) with stiffer leather for reliable fly ball control. The first baseman's mitt requires extra padding and a deep pocket to handle high-velocity throws from the mound. 

![Easton-Baseball-Gloves-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Easton-Baseball-Gloves-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Hand Fit and Comfort

Proper hand fit is crucial for both performance and long-term comfort. Measure your hand with a flexible measuring tape, adding 1-1.5 inches for the glove size. The glove should fit snugly but allow full finger movement. Consider glove manufacturers' sizing charts for precise measurements and fit recommendations. 


### Leather Quality and Construction

Easton gloves use premium leather sourced from tanneries in France and Italy. Full-grain leather offers superior durability and moisture resistance. Stitching type and pattern affect glove longevity - reinforcing stitches and diamond patterns distribute pressure more effectively. Consider the impact of different construction methods on glove feel and responsiveness. 

![Easton-Baseball-Gloves-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Easton-Baseball-Gloves-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Customization Options

Personalization features enhance both performance and customization. Webbing configuration affects ball handling - traditional webs provide maximum exposure, while closed webs improve stability. Glove color and pattern options allow personal expression. Some models offer interchangeable linings for adapting to changing weather conditions. 


## FAQ

![Easton-Baseball-Gloves-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Easton-Baseball-Gloves-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What materials are used in Easton baseball gloves?

Easton baseball gloves feature high-quality materials including premium leather for the main construction, reinforced stitching, and durable palm reinforcement. The gloves are also equipped with Easton's ProGrip technology, which includes a moisture-wicking palm lining to enhance grip. 

Easton utilizes both full-grain leather and premium synthetic materials. Full-grain leather gloves provide the best feel and durability, while synthetic options offer a more budget-friendly alternative with similar performance. 


### How do I determine the right glove size?

Measure the length of your longest finger (excluding the thumb) and add one inch. This measurement should match the glove's finger length. The overall glove size typically ranges from 10.5 to 12 inches, though position-specific gloves may vary (e. g. , 11 inches for a shortstop). 

Consider that Easton offers both regular and junior sizes. Regular sizes (10.5-11.5 inches) are suitable for older youth and adults, while junior sizes (9.5-10.5 inches) are designed for younger players ages 6-12. 

![Easton-Baseball-Gloves-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Easton-Baseball-Gloves-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is ProGrip technology?

ProGrip is Easton's proprietary technology that improves glove grip through several components. It features a textured palm surface, moisture-wicking lining, and finger-slot design that prevents the ball from rolling out during catches. The technology is particularly effective in maintaining grip during cold weather or in damp conditions. 

The ProGrip system includes different layers: an outer layer for abrasion resistance, an inner layer for water resistance, and a moisture-wicking lining that keeps the palm dry. This combination creates a secure, comfortable grip during intense gameplay. 


### How long does an Easton baseball glove last?

With proper care, an Easton baseball glove can last 10-15 years. Factors affecting longevity include the type of material (full-grain leather lasts longer than synthetic), frequency of use, and maintenance practices. Gloves that receive regular breaking-in and are stored properly in a cool, dry place tend to last longer. 

The lifespan can be extended by following proper care instructions: regular conditioning, avoiding harsh chemicals, and storing the glove with the webbing facing up. Professional players often replace gloves every 3-5 years, depending on usage and conditions. 

![Easton-Baseball-Gloves-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Easton-Baseball-Gloves-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Are Easton gloves suitable for all positions?

Easton offers specialized gloves for each fielding position, from catchers to outfielders. Each position requires different attributes: catchers need deep-web gloves for blocking, infielders need shorter gloves for quick reactions, and outfielders need wider gloves for deep catches. 

While players can cross-grade sizes, it's generally recommended to choose position-specific gloves. Infielders might consider a 10.5 to 11-inch glove, while outfielders typically prefer 11 to 12-inch gloves. Specialized gloves provide better control, comfort, and performance for their specific role. 


### Can Easton gloves be customized?

Most Easton gloves come standard with sizing adjustments through the cuff and webbing. The webbing can be re-tensioned to tighten or loosen the glove, while the cuff can be adjusted for a better fit around the wrist. Some models offer additional customization through palm inserts or webbing configurations. 

Professional customization services are available for select models. These services can adjust the webbing, replace pads, or modify the glove's structure for specific needs. However, these services are typically reserved for advanced players who require precise customization.
