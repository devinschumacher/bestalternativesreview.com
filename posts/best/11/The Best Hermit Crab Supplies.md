## Buyer's Guide

Hermit crabs require specific supplies to maintain their health and well-being in captivity. Understanding the necessary items and their importance will help you create a suitable environment for your pet. 


### Shells

Shells are essential as hermit crabs change them as they grow. Provide a variety of sizes and types, including both land and water shells, to allow your crab to select an appropriate new home. 


### Humidity and Water

Maintaining proper humidity levels (60-70%) is crucial for hermit crab health. Provide a humidity gauge and a water dish large enough for soaking. A humidifier or misting system can help maintain optimal humidity levels. 


### Substrate

Use coconut fiber or sterile coconut substrate as a safe substrate that retains moisture. Avoid sand, which can cause impaction, and gravel, which is too sharp. 


### Other Essentials

In addition to the basics, consider providing natural branches for climbing, decorative items, and hiding spots. A properly lit aquarium with UVB lighting can also enhance their welfare. 


## FAQ


### What type of habitat should I provide for my hermit crab?

A suitable habitat should include a large tank (minimum 10 gallons per crab), with a secure lid to prevent escapes. The tank should have a substrate of moistened coconut fiber or sand for burrowing, with hiding spots made from cork bark, tropical wood branches, or commercial hermit crab caves. 

Temperature should range between 72-80°F (22-27°C) with a relative humidity of 75-85% to prevent dehydration. The habitat should mimic natural conditions with variations in temperature and humidity levels. 


### How do I properly set up the tank substrate?

Use a 4-6 inch layer of moistened coconut fiber or sand at the bottom of the enclosure. The substrate should be lightly dampened to prevent drying out but not soggy. Avoid using cedar or pine shavings which are toxic to hermit crabs. 

Regularly mist the substrate to maintain appropriate humidity levels and check for dry spots. The substrate should be cleaned or replaced when it becomes dirty or develops an ammonia odor. 


### What foods are appropriate for hermit crabs?

A balanced diet should include a combination of commercial hermit crab food, fresh fruits, and vegetables. Key components are protein sources like mealworms or fish flakes, along with calcium-rich foods such as crushed eggshells or calcium powder. 

Offer fresh fruits and vegetables daily, removing any uneaten food after 24 hours to prevent mold growth. Fresh water must always be available in a shallow dish to prevent tipping. 


### How much space does each hermit crab need?

Each hermit crab should have a minimum of 10 gallons of tank space to ensure adequate movement and exploration. Larger crabs or larger species may need more space, with additional hiding spots and vertical climbing structures. 

The tank should allow for a natural terrain variation with both horizontal walking surfaces and vertical structures. This helps the crabs maintain their natural behavior patterns and social structure. 


### What about environmental enrichment and social interaction?

Provide puzzle feeders, coconut halves, and other interactive toys to keep the crabs mentally stimulated. Natural beach sand or driftwood can encourage natural behaviors like digging and climbing. 

Housing multiple hermit crabs allows for social interaction and can improve overall health. However, introduce new crabs carefully to avoid territorial disputes or aggressive interactions. 


### How often should I maintain the enclosure?

Perform daily spot cleaning to remove waste and uneaten food. This helps maintain proper hygiene and reduces the risk of health issues. 

Complete tank maintenance every 2-4 weeks, which includes removing food particles, checking substrate for ammonia odor, and spot cleaning the tank walls. Replace the entire substrate annually and perform a full tank cleaning every 6-12 months.
