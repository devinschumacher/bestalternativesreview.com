### Can these sweatpants be worn as pajamas?

While Under Armour sweatpants are designed for athletic wear, their soft-touch interiors and relaxed fit make them comfortable enough for lounging at home. They're suitable for casual wear around the house or as sleep pants. 

However, the technical features like compression and moisture-wicking might be unnecessary for extended wear, so consider whether you want pants specifically designed for athletic versus casual use. 


### Which sizes run true to fit?

Under Armour generally runs true to size in their sweatpants. We recommend choosing your regular size for the most comfortable fit. If you prefer a more relaxed style, sizing up is recommended. 

For optimal performance and durability, go with your normal size. Sizing up can affect the compression and moisture-wicking properties of the pants.

### How do these pants compare to compression pants?

Under Armour sweatpants offer more insulation and breathability than compression pants, making them suitable for a wider range of activities. The compression pants in their lineup provide enhanced support for specific sports and recovery, particularly in the lower body. 

Both types of pants share similar construction features like moisture-wicking and odor-fighting technology, but the designs differ based on intended use and fit preferences. 


### What's the best way to care for these pants?

Machine wash your Under Armour sweatpants in cold water with like colors to maintain the performance and color integrity of the fabric. Avoid using bleach or fabric softeners, which can damage the moisture-wicking properties. 

Always air dry your pants to prevent shrinkage and preserve the thermal properties of the thermal layers. This maintenance will help extend the life of your investment and maintain optimal performance.
