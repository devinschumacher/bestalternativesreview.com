## Buyer's Guide

As dogs age, their nutritional needs change, making senior dog food an important consideration for pet owners. Royal Canin offers several senior formulas designed to address common age-related health concerns. Understanding the key aspects of senior dog nutrition will help you choose the right Royal Canin formula for your pet. 


### Caloric Needs

Senior dogs typically require fewer calories than younger dogs due to reduced activity levels and metabolism changes. Look for formulas that provide appropriate energy levels without excess calories, helping to prevent obesity which can affect joint health and overall mobility. 


### Joint Support

Many senior dogs experience joint issues. Royal Canin's senior formulas contain ingredients like glucosamine and chondroitin to support joint health and reduce discomfort from arthritis. These nutrients help maintain cartilage integrity and promote healthy joint function. 


### Heart Health

Heart health becomes more important as dogs age. Some Royal Canin senior formulas include taurine and omega-3 fatty acids to support cardiovascular health. These nutrients help maintain a healthy heart rhythm and support overall cardiac function. 


### Digestive Health

Aging dogs may experience changes in digestion. Look for formulas that include prebiotics and probiotics to support gut health and improve nutrient absorption. These ingredients help maintain a healthy balance of gut bacteria and prevent digestive issues common in senior pets.
