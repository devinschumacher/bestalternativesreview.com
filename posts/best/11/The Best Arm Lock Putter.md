After refinements in the workshop, the BB28 Slotback presents a more compact blade with taller muscles and a narrower pocket.

The 303 stainless steel construction and Black Pearl PVD finish provide durability and premium feel for every putt.

When you need to quiet those twitchy wrists and find a more consistent stroke, the Odyssey 2-Ball Ten Arm Lock Putter is worth a try. With its longer shaft design, it gives you that anchored putter feel without actually touching your body—kind of like having an invisible string attached to your left arm.

![Bettinardi 2024 Inovai 6.0 Armlock Putter | Image](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcQyCqsFeNt2h7wfSiZVq36s-Joxegs\_yfnGRFKYkZXwjCr2BD0&usqp=CAY)

The completely redesigned 2024 INOVAI 6.0 puts a fresh spin on Bettinardi's popular\_armlock\_design with its clean lines and stepless wing shape that's easier on the eyes at address. What really sets it apart is how the designers cleverly moved the Center of Gravity up by 27% using those clever Variable Depth Ports in the sole – that subtle change makes a big difference in feel and stability. 


### [Odyssey 2021 Ten 2-Ball Arm Lock Putter](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Arm+Lock+Putter?utm\_term=odyssey-2021-ten-2-ball-arm-lock-putter)

![Odyssey 2021 Ten 2-Ball Arm Lock Putter | Image](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcQhr7yYtVAHNdw91c1S0JVutEKY9WYv8wVXNvxBvnU88MnYiUePrTSlR2URoSCMp9kq8CqMwTqJAch2h1kIMyggGhYYfzhI&usqp=CAY)

This Odyssey putter combines a stable design with adjustable weight for fine-tuning your stroke. The arm lock grip helps maintain proper putting posture, though some may prefer a different feel. Reviews praise its solid construction and balanced weight, though a few note it takes time to develop comfort with the forward press technique. 


### [Odyssey Ai One Cruiser Arm Lock Putter Right 42](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Arm+Lock+Putter?utm\_term=odyssey-ai-one-cruiser-arm-lock-putter-right-42)

### [Ping Harwood Armlock Golf Putter](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Arm+Lock+Putter?utm\_term=ping-harwood-armlock-golf-putter)

![Ping Harwood Armlock Golf Putter | Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcSvNPW4gF4kDpmWRu2td9TKBb1n7-5q9qpTxwhmQOSOJwX1hy\_UE1k1rb7Aphs4nNoTGNm4C\_JPcQ\_\_TnHLiikon1XSHkYX&usqp=CAY)

These putters blend classic PING engineering with modern arm-lock technology, though some users find the learning curve steep. With a standard 41.5-inch length and 385g head weight, they promote a straight stroke with a slight arc, but the adjustable length shaft can sometimes cause shaft loading issues at longer distances. The black-painted mallet head looks sleek, though early reviews note the finish quality could be better, with some users reporting paint chipping after just one round. Despite these minor drawbacks, many praise the putter's forgiveness and improved swing control for both distance and direction.

## Buyer's Guide

Arm lock putters represent a distinct approach to golf putter design, featuring a mid-hexagonal shaft that helps stabilize the arms during the putting stroke. These putters require careful consideration of several key aspects to ensure they meet your specific needs and playing style. 


### Shaft Design and Fit

The distinctive hexagonal shaft requires precise fitting to ensure proper grip and stability. Golfers should evaluate the shaft's diameter, length, and curvature to match their hand size and putting stance. The shaft should allow for a secure grip while maintaining natural wrist positioning.

### Clubhead Design

The clubhead's shape and weighting play crucial roles in determining the putter's performance. Most arm lock putters feature a larger, more traditional appearance, with weight distributed towards the face to promote solid contact. Experimenting with different head designs can help golfers find a model that enhances their putting stroke. 


### Performance Characteristics

Key performance factors include face angle consistency, sweet spot size, and impact response. Arm lock putters typically emphasize a square-face design to maintain proper impact alignment. The sweet spot should be generously sized to accommodate off-center hits, while responsive face materials help transfer energy to the ball.

### Usage and Compatibility

These putters work best for golfers with a more traditional putting stroke and neutral to slightly open face preferences. They may not be suitable for players who prefer very low centers of gravity or highly milled face designs. Compatibility with existing golf equipment, such as shoes and gloves, should also be considered. 


## FAQ

![Arm-Lock-Putter-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Arm-Lock-Putter-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is an Arm Lock Putter?

Our Arm Lock Putter combines advanced design elements to enhance putting consistency and reduce unnecessary arm movement. The unique features help you maintain proper posture and promote a more controlled stroke. 

Each putter includes a specialized grip sleeve that guides your arms along a straight path, while the head design focuses on an optimal weight distribution for consistent impact. 


### How does it work?

The Arm Lock Putter works by training your arms to move in a straight line during the stroke, minimizing the influence of wrist and elbow action. This alignment helps maintain a consistent putting path and speed. 

The grip sleeve and head design work together to promote proper posture and allow for a smooth, controlled stroke. Regular practice with this putter can improve your consistency on the greens.

### Is it right for me?

This putter may be particularly beneficial if you struggle with inconsistent arm movement or lack confidence in your putting stroke. It's ideal for players who want to focus more on mechanics rather than feel. 

If you're new to the Arm Lock Putter concept or prefer a more traditional putter, we recommend trying a demonstration or rental before committing to a purchase. 


### How long does it take to see results?

Most players notice improved consistency within the first few weeks of regular practice. The key is consistent repetition to develop new muscle memory and refine your stroke. 

It's important to allow time for proper adaptation. Some players may see results more quickly than others, depending on their current technique and practice habits.

### Can I use it for all putts?

The Arm Lock Putter is designed for all lengths of putts, from three feet to long-range attempts. Its focus on straight-line movement makes it particularly effective for both close-in and longer putts. 

Some players use it exclusively, while others may alternate with their regular putter. Experiment to determine what works best for your game. 


### How do I maintain it?

Regular maintenance includes cleaning the grip sleeve daily and inspecting the putter head for any wear. The grip sleeve should be replaced when signs of wear appear. 

Store the putter in a dry place when not in use. Avoid exposing it to extreme temperatures or moisture, which can damage the grip sleeve material.
