## Buyer's Guide

A bedside tray table is a practical addition to any bedroom, offering convenience and functionality. These compact pieces of furniture provide a stable surface for reading material, beverages, or electronic devices while you sit in bed. When selecting a bedside tray table, consider several key factors to find the right piece for your needs. 


### Size and Space Considerations

Measure the available space next to your bed to determine the appropriate tray table dimensions. Standard sizes range from 12 to 24 inches wide and 18 to 30 inches deep. Ensure the table extends a safe distance from the mattress edge to prevent nighttime tumbles. Additionally, consider the frequency of use - a smaller table may suffice for occasional reading, while a larger table is suitable for regular use with multiple items. 


### Stability and Construction Quality

Look for tray tables with stable bases and secure construction. The legs should be firmly attached to prevent wobbling during use. Consider materials like metal, which provides stability and durability, versus plastic, which might be less expensive but less reliable over time. The tray surface should be flat and smooth to prevent tipping, with options for both solid surfaces and hinged designs that fold down for storage. 


### Storage and Organization Features

Many bedside tray tables include additional storage options to keep your space organized. Look for features like drawers, shelves, or built-in pockets. These can store items like magazines, remote controls, or personal care products. The storage should be accessible while the table is in use and secure enough to prevent items from falling out during movement. 


### Care and Maintenance Requirements

Consider the ease of cleaning and maintenance when choosing a bedside tray table. Surfacing materials like glass or polished metals require minimal care, while textured finishes or complex patterns might be more difficult to maintain. Check if the table has any protective coatings that might affect cleaning methods. Also, consider the ease of moving the table - lightweight designs with four wheels are convenient for adjusting positioning, but might not provide the same stability as heavier, stationary tables. 


## FAQ


### What is a bedside tray table?

A bedside tray table combines a raised surface with storage, perfect for holding books, devices, or snacks while you sit in bed. These compact tables tuck under the head of your bed when not in use, conserving space. 

Most bedside tray tables measure between 18-24 inches wide and 12-16 inches deep, with a height typically ranging from 9-14 inches. The storage compartments usually accommodate items like remote controls, books, or small baskets. 


### What materials are used in bedside tray tables?

Bedside tray tables are made from a variety of materials, including MDF (Medium-Density Fiberboard), painted steel, and engineered wood. Higher-end models often feature solid wood construction with premium finishes. 

The storage compartments usually have plastic or metal interiors to prevent damage from frequently moved items. Many modern designs incorporate glass or acrylic panels for added visual appeal while keeping the weight manageable. 


### How do I choose the right size?

Measure the width of your bed and subtract 24 inches to determine the ideal tray table width. This allows the table to tuck underneath the mattress comfortably. The depth should be around 12-16 inches to provide ample space for items. 

Consider the height of your bedding - if you use heavy comforters, choose a table with a slightly lower profile. Always measure your chosen spot before purchasing to ensure proper fit. 


### What features should I look for?

The base should securely lock in place to prevent tipping or movement during use. Look for trays with smooth edges and child-friendly corners to prevent injury. 

Storage compartments should lock shut to prevent items from sliding out. Consider models with multiple compartments for better organization. USB ports integrated into the design can be convenient for charging devices. 


### How do I clean a bedside tray table?

Most bedside tray tables can be wiped clean with a damp cloth and mild soap solution. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners that could damage the surface finish. 

Storage compartments should be emptied before cleaning to prevent water damage. Plastic interiors can be rinsed with water, while metal parts may need specific cleaning solutions based on the manufacturer's recommendations. 


### How do I store the tray when not in use?

Most tray tables have a simple unlocking mechanism that allows the top surface to lift up and tuck neatly under the raised base. Some models feature telescoping legs that allow additional storage space when compacted. 

If your table doesn't have a storage solution, consider purchasing a matching storage ottoman or basket to keep the room organized. Always store the table with the tray in the down position to prevent tipping or damage during transport.
