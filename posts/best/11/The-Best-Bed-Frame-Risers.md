## Buyer's Guide

Bed frame risers are a practical solution for adding height to your mattress, whether you're converting a low platform bed or simply need more legroom. These adjustable spacers work by placing them between your frame and mattress, raising the sleep surface to a more comfortable level. 


### Adjustability Features

Look for bed frame risers that offer height customization through different stacking configurations. Check if they have clear height increments marked on the packaging or packaging design. Remember that each riser typically adds 2-3 inches of height, so calculate how many you'll need based on your desired lift and current bed frame dimensions. 

![Bed-Frame-Risers-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Bed-Frame-Risers-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### MATERIAL AND CONSTRUCTION

The most common materials are plastic and metal. Plastic risers are lightweight and available in various colors, blending well with modern designs. Metal risers, usually made from steel or aluminum, provide added stability and are suitable for heavier mattresses. Consider the weight capacity recommended for your specific mattress weight to ensure safety and longevity. 


### FIT AND ADJUSTMENT

Proper fit is crucial for bed frame risers to prevent gaps or slippage. Check if they snap-click into place, which can provide a more secure attachment than friction-fit alternatives. Also, verify that the height can be adjusted easily without completely removing them, as this makes it simpler to fine-tune the mattress height. 

![Bed-Frame-Risers-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Bed-Frame-Risers-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Care and Maintenance

Since bed frame risers are in constant contact with your mattress and foundation, they require regular cleaning. Most can be wiped down with a damp cloth and mild cleaner. For plastic models, note that they might show water spots, while metal risers can develop oxidation if not properly maintained. Always refer to the manufacturer's instructions for the best cleaning methods specific to your model. 


## FAQ

![Bed-Frame-Risers-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Bed-Frame-Risers-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a bed frame riser?

A bed frame riser is a specialized support that raises the height of your bed frame by 2-6 inches without affecting its stability. These compact supports slide between the legs of your existing bed frame, extending the usable sleeping surface closer to the desired height. 

Bed frame risers are particularly useful for older mattresses that have lost their support, for homes with high ceilings where traditional bed height feels too low, or for adding extra storage beneath the bed. 


### Are bed frame risers compatible with all bed frames?

Bed frame risers are most compatible with platform beds and box spring-free frames. They are typically not recommended for beds with metal frames or adjustable legs, as these designs may require additional support. 

Always verify compatibility with your specific bed frame model. Risers with universal sliding mechanisms work best with standard mattress thicknesses, while specialty models may be needed for specific frame styles. 

![Bed-Frame-Risers-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Bed-Frame-Risers-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How many risers do I need?

Calculate the number of risers based on the length of your bed frame. For single beds with two legs, one riser per leg is usually sufficient. For queen and king beds, you typically need one riser for each pair of legs. 

Consider buying extra risers in case of wear or if you later decide to adjust your bed height. This provides flexibility and ensures a uniform height across the bed frame. 


### Do bed frame risers affect mattress support?

Bed frame risers maintain proper mattress support by using the existing bed frame's legs. They do not add extra support but help distribute the mattress weight evenly across a larger surface area. 

For maximum support, always use the appropriate number of risers and verify that your mattress thickness matches the risers' specifications. This ensures optimal bed height and mattress stability. 

![Bed-Frame-Risers-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Bed-Frame-Risers-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do I install bed frame risers?

Installation is straightforward. Align the risers with the inner edges of your bed frame legs, ensuring they sit evenly across all legs for consistent height. Slide them into place until they rest against the frame's bottom surface. 

Once installed, double-check the stability by gently pressing down on different parts of the bed frame. The risers should feel solid and not wobble, indicating proper installation. 


### What materials should bed frame risers be made from?

Bed frame risers are available in different materials, with the most common being solid wood, plastic, and metal. Plastic risers are lightweight and cost-effective but may not support heavier mattress setups as well as metal or wood options. 

Metal risers provide the best combination of load-bearing capacity and durability. Look for risers with a protective coating to prevent rust and ensure they match your bed frame's aesthetic (e. g. , brushed metal or powder-coated finishes).
