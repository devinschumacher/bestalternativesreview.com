Choose a holster with appropriate retention for your carry preference. Light retention suits everyday carry, while heavy retention is ideal for concealed carry or duty purposes. Adjustable retention systems allow fine-tuning based on gun model and user preference. 


### Carrier Compatibility

Ensure the holster design matches your body type and carry position. OWB (outside-the-waistband) options suit various waist sizes, while IWB (inside-the-waistband) designs require specific clothing fit. Consider additional items like magazine carriers to optimize your carry setup.
