## FAQ

![Ash-Lynx-Perfume-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Ash-Lynx-Perfume-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What notes compose Ash Lynx Perfume, and what is its character?

Ash Lynx Perfume opens with zesty citrus notes of bergamot and orange, followed by a heart of blackcurrant and jasmine. The base delivers rich, warm tones of sandalwood and patchouli, creating a sophisticated, modern scent profile. 

The fragrance's character combines freshness with depth, making it suitable for both daytime wear and special occasions. It's particularly notable for its long-lasting properties and its ability to adapt subtly to the wearer's chemistry. 


### What makes Ash Lynx Perfume different from the original Ash Unite?

Ash Lynx Perfume introduces a more robust, assertive character while maintaining the signature Ash Unite formula's sophistication. The key difference lies in intensified woody and amber accents, giving the scent greater depth and intensity. 

This evolution in formulation makes Ash Lynx particularly appealing to those who prefer a longer-lasting, more pronounced fragrance presence without altering the brand's core identity. 

![Ash-Lynx-Perfume-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Ash-Lynx-Perfume-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How does Ash Lynx Perfume perform in various climates?

In warm conditions, the scent tends to project more intensely, while cooler temperatures allow the base notes to develop more fully. Humid environments can slightly affect longevity but don't impact the fragrance's quality. 

Overall, Ash Lynx maintains good wearability across most climates, though its performance may vary slightly based on local humidity and temperature conditions. 


### What is the recommended spritz technique for Ash Lynx Perfume?

For the best results, spritz the perfume onto pulse points such as the wrists, neck, and behind the ears. These areas naturally retain heat, helping the fragrance blend with your skin chemistry and last longer. 

Avoid spraying directly onto clothes or in confined spaces, as this can cause the scent to dissipate more quickly and become less refined. 

![Ash-Lynx-Perfume-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Ash-Lynx-Perfume-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How long does Ash Lynx Perfume typically last?

When applied correctly, Ash Lynx provides lasting wear of 5-6 hours on average, with noticeable top notes fading to a more subtle presence over time. The longevity can extend with additional applications throughout the day. 

Due to its rich composition, the fragrance often requires less frequent reapplication compared to lighter colognes, making it practical for all-day wear. 


### Can Ash Lynx Perfume be mixed with other scents?

The fragrance's complexity makes it versatile for layering. It pairs particularly well with vanilla, amber, and woody notes, enhancing its natural character while creating unique blends. 

However, mixing with similar heavy fragrances may lead to overly strong concentrations, so it's best to experiment with lighter, complementary scents to maintain fragrance balance.
