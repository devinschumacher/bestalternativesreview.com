## Buyer's Guide

Antique coffee tables add distinctive character and timeless elegance to any living room. When selecting an authentic piece, consider several key factors to ensure you find one that matches both your aesthetic and functional needs. 


### Materials and Construction

The primary material (mahogany, walnut, rosewood) significantly influences an antique coffee table's durability and value. Look for solid wood construction with clean joinery and original hardware. Quality craftsmanship is evident in precise mortise-and-tenon joints and flush-fitting drawers. 


### Style and Proportions

Match the table's style to your room's period decoration. Queen Anne, Federal, or Arts & Crafts pieces require different proportions and details. Ensure the table's height, overall width, and legs' style complement your sofa and surrounding furniture. 


### Condition and Wear

Investigate the table's condition closely. Natural wear marks on the surface are expected but should not indicate major damage. Check for cracked finishes, loose joints, or missing parts. Professional restoration can repair many issues, but it's crucial to verify the authenticity of any recent work. 


### Care and Maintenance

Understand the specific care requirements for your chosen material. Regular maintenance of natural finishes involves proper cleaning, waxing, and protection from sunlight. Consider your ability to perform these tasks before finalizing your selection.
