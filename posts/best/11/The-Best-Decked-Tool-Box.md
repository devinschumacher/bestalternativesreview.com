## Buyer's Guide

A decked tool box is an essential storage solution for any workshop or garage, offering both functionality and organization. These specialized boxes combine a work surface with storage, making them ideal for housing tools and materials while providing a clean workspace. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the right decked tool box for your needs. 


### Size and Dimensions

When selecting a decked tool box, measuring your available space is crucial. Consider the overall dimensions, including length, width, and height, to ensure the box fits comfortably in your designated area. The work surface should extend beyond the storage compartments to create a practical workspace, typically measuring between 30-60 inches in length and 18-24 inches in width. 


### Material Build Quality

Decked tool boxes are available in various materials, each offering different levels of durability and work surface stability. Steel construction provides exceptional strength and rust resistance, while aluminum options are lightweight and corrosion-resistant. The work surface should be made from a solid material like steel or aluminum alloy, with a thickness of at least 1/4 inch to support tools and materials. 


### Storage Compartment Features

Effective organization requires thoughtful storage design. Look for compartments with adjustable dividers that can be customized to fit different tool sizes. Tool-specific storage solutions, such as magnetic strips for blades or specialized trays for nuts and bolts, can significantly enhance accessibility and organization. The lid should open and close smoothly with a locking mechanism to secure contents. 


### Work Surface Additions

While the basic work surface provides a flat surface for tools, consider additional features that can enhance functionality. Rolling casters on the bottom allow for easy mobility between work areas. Power outlets integrated into the work surface enable charging or powering tools directly from the box. Tool hooks along the sides or rear of the box provide extra hanging storage and prevent tools from rolling around during transport. 


## FAQ


### What makes Decked Tool Boxes unique?

Decked Tool Boxes combine durable construction with practical features. Their water-resistant interior coatings and heavy-duty locking mechanisms protect both tools and keys. 

Unlike generic tool boxes, these models often include organizer systems and wall-mounting options, making them suitable for both garage storage and vehicle transport. 


### How do I choose the right size?

Measure your tools first. Add 2-3 inches to your longest tool's length and width to account for handles and clearance. For depth, add about 1 inch on all sides. 

Compare your measurement to the box's interior dimensions. The tools should fit comfortably with some space for proper organization and easy access. 


### Can they be installed in vehicles?

Decked Tool Boxes with heavy-duty corners and reinforced walls typically perform well in vehicle mounts. Look for models with integrated mounting holes or dedicated kits. 

Ensure the box's size matches your vehicle's available space and that the mounting system is securely attached to prevent movement during transit. 


### What kind of maintenance do they require?

Regularly clean the exterior with mild soap and water, avoiding abrasive cleaners that could damage the surface finish. Check the locking mechanism every six months for proper operation. 

Inside, wipe down tools after use and store them properly to prevent scratching the interior coating. For extended storage, apply a light coat ofWD-40 to prevent rust on tool surfaces. 


### Are they suitable for outdoor use?

The water-resistant interior coatings make these boxes ideal for tools stored in sheds, garages, or vehicles exposed to occasional rain. Direct exposure to extreme elements may still impact performance. 

For outdoor storage, consider models with fully sealed lids and protective corners to minimize damage from impacts and harsh weather conditions. 


### How do I secure tools inside?

Most Decked Tool Boxes include rail systems or interchangeable organizers. These help keep tools in place during transport and prevent movement during travel. 

Use the company's recommended organizers or install your own to create zones for different tool types. This ensures everything has a designated spot and remains accessible.
