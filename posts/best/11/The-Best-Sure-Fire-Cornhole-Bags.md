## Buyer's Guide

Sure Fire Cornhole Bags combine durability and functionality to help you dominate the game. Here's what you need to consider when choosing the right set for your backyard competitions. 


### Material Quality

High-quality cornhole bags are typically made from rugged polyester blends that resist wear and tear. Look for construction details like reinforced stitches at stress points and heavier-duty zippers for the pockets. Premium sets often include mesh backing to prevent sand leakage and increase weight stability. 


### Size and Weight

Standard cornhole bags measure 7-9 inches in diameter and weigh between 1-2 pounds. Heavier bags provide more surface area for your shot but can be harder to lift. Consider your physical ability and playing style when selecting the optimal weight range. 


### Design and Appearance

Select bags that match your personal taste while considering visibility during gameplay. Bright colors or unique patterns can help you track your shots, but overly distracting designs may not be ideal for quick decision-making. Look for clear labeling of your team's colors to maintain focus on the game. 


### Additional Features

Some premium bags include safety features like sand-filled cores for consistent weight distribution. Consider sets that offer customization options like detachable pockets for scoring chips or built-in handles for easier carrying. These extras can enhance both functionality and convenience during gameplay. 


## FAQ


### What makes these cornhole bags "Sure Fire"?

These bags feature a unique weight distribution system that optimizes their flight path and landing accuracy. The manufacturer claims this design provides consistently straighter throws and more predictable results compared to standard cornhole bags. 

Independent testing has shown that the bags maintain their intended trajectory better than similar products, making them a strong choice for both casual players and competitive enthusiasts. 


### Are these bags machine washable?

Yes, the bags are machine washable, which helps maintain their performance and extends their lifespan. The manufacturer recommends using a regular wash cycle with mild detergent and avoiding fabric softeners, as they can affect the weight distribution and balance of the bag. 

After washing, it's important to remove excess water and air dry the bags completely before reuse to maintain their optimal playing conditions. 


### What's the durability like?

These bags have received high praise for their durability, with many users reporting they retain their shape and performance even after extensive use. The stitching is robust, and the material shows minimal signs of wear with regular play. 

The manufacturer offers a satisfaction guarantee, indicating confidence in their durability. However, like any outdoor equipment, proper care and storage are essential for maintaining longevity. 


### How do they compare to other popular brands?

Based on user reviews and independent testing, these bags perform well against other leading brands in terms of weight distribution and flight characteristics. While other bags might have different strengths, these Sure Fire bags stand out for their consistent performance across various playing conditions. 

Key differentiators include their patented weight system and slightly heavier material, which some players find gives them an edge in windy conditions. 


### What's the weight capacity?

Each bag is designed to hold 18oz of filler material, meaning you can add small sandbags or other dense items to customize the weight. This allows players to adjust the heaviness to their preference while maintaining the optimal flight characteristics. 

While the bags can handle additional weight beyond the recommended 18oz, the performance and balance may be compromised, so it's advisable to stick to the suggested weight range. 


### How should I transport them?

These bags feature a durable, reinforced carry handle and double-stitched seams that make them suitable for both casual transport and travel. Many users report being able to carry multiple bags comfortably without strain. 

When storing or transporting, it's recommended to secure the bags in a bag or container to prevent tangles and protect the stitching. The manufacturer also offers a carrying bag as an optional accessory.
