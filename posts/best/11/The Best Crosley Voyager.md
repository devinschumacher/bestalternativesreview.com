### [Crosley Discovery Turntable](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Crosley+Voyager?utm\_term=crosley-discovery-turntable)

![Crosley Discovery Turntable | Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcQa-9V9V1mIHzktu2BGKgbsj2OfydXB9znjYDXTRWddF6mUeEsb&usqp=CAY)

This retro-styled record player combines good looks with basic functionality, though the built-in speakers deliver tinny sound that falls far short of expectations. The 3-speed operation works decently enough for standard 33, 45, and 78 RPM records, but the included turntable can struggle with maintaining consistent playback. Portable and Bluetooth-enabled, it's disappointing that the included audio quality doesn't match what you'd get from modern wireless speakers.
