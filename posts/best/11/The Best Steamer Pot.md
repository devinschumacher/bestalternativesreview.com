## FAQ

![Steamer-Pot-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Steamer-Pot-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a steamer pot?

A steamer pot combines a cooking pot with a detachable steaming basket. The basket sits inside the pot, allowing you to steam vegetables, fish, and other foods while cooking liquids (like water or broth) remain in the pot below. 

This versatile kitchen appliance helps retain nutrients in foods, making it a healthy cooking option. The separation between cooking liquid and food also prevents the food from becoming waterlogged. 


### What sizes are available?

Steamer pots come in various sizes, typically ranging from 1.5 to 6 quarts. The smallest ones are ideal for personal use or single servings, while larger models can accommodate family-sized meals or multiple dishes simultaneously. 

Consider the number of servings you need and the types of foods you'll be cooking to determine the right size for your needs. 

![Steamer-Pot-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Steamer-Pot-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do you use a steamer pot?

Fill the pot with a small amount of water, place the steaming basket inside, and bring the water to a boil. Add your food to the basket, cover, and steam for the recommended time based on the food type and desired doneness. 

Most steamer pots have a secure lid with steam vents, and some include a rack to raise the basket above the water level for even steam distribution. 


### What materials are available?

Steamer pots are often made from stainless steel, aluminum, or glass. Stainless steel and aluminum provide durability and conduct heat well, while glass models allow you to see the cooking process. 

The steaming basket typically matches the material of the pot and may include features like a wire rack or mesh design for even steam distribution. 

![Steamer-Pot-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Steamer-Pot-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do you clean a steamer pot?

Rinse the steaming basket and pot with hot water after use. For stainless steel and aluminum models, a mild soap solution is suitable, while glass pots may only need water and a soft cloth. 

Check the manufacturer's instructions for specific cleaning recommendations, as some parts may require hand washing or dishwasher use. 


### What types of foods are suitable?

Steamer pots excel at cooking vegetables, fish, poultry, and delicate foods that benefit from gentle heat. They're ideal for preparing foods that retain their texture and nutrients best when steamed. 

Avoid using the pot for foods that release excessive moisture, as this can affect the steaming efficiency and food quality. Always check the manufacturer's guidelines for specific food recommendations.
