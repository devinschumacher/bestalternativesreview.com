### [Pre-Owned 2017 Gibson Firebird T Pelham Blue Electric Guitar](https://serp.ly/amazon/Gibson+Firebird?utm\_term=pre-owned-2017-gibson-firebird-t-pelham-blue-electric-guitar)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Gibson+Firebird?utm_term=pre-owned-2017-gibson-firebird-t-pelham-blue-electric-guitar"><img alt="gibson-2017-firebird-t-electric-guitar-pelham-blue-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gibson-2017-firebird-t-electric-guitar-pelham-blue-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Vintage Sunburst Gibson Firebird Studio 2018 Guitar](https://serp.ly/amazon/Gibson+Firebird?utm\_term=vintage-sunburst-gibson-firebird-studio-2018-guitar)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Gibson+Firebird?utm_term=vintage-sunburst-gibson-firebird-studio-2018-guitar"><img alt="gibson-firebird-studio-2018-vintage-sunburst-guitar-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gibson-firebird-studio-2018-vintage-sunburst-guitar-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently gave a whirl to the 2018 Gibson Firebird Studio in a stunning Vintage Sunburst finish, and let me tell you, it's been a rollercoaster of emotions. On one hand, the body is crafted from mahogany, a classic material that gives the guitar its rich, resonant tones. But on the flipside, it's a bit on the heavy side, weighing around 6.75 pounds - a price to pay for that vintage vibe. 

The neck is a thing of beauty, made from mahogany too. It's got 22 medium jumbo frets, which provides excellent playability, especially for those who prefer a smoother feel. The pickup configuration is truly remarkable - Gibson has replaced the regular humbuckers with P90 single coil pickups, giving the guitar a unique, almost vintage sound. However, one drawback is the case is a bit bulky, taking up a fair amount of space. 

Overall, I've been thoroughly impressed with the guitar. Its unique design and tonal characteristics have really won me over, and I've had a blast playing it at various gigs. I highly recommend it, as long as you're prepared for the slightly heavier load.

The neck pickup delivers clear and powerful sound, while the bridge pickup offers a perfect blend of warmth and punch. The guitar's lightweight nature makes it easy to play, even during long sessions. However, potential buyers should be aware of the guitar's larger size, as it may require additional care when transporting. 

The guitar also comes with a Gibson soft case and genuine case candy, along with a factory Gibson gig bag in great condition. The bag's interior is clean, with no signs of pet odors or smoke damage. The pickguard displays minor scuffs, and the finish has a bit of wear, but these are typical signs of play.

### [1963 Gibson Firebird V Vintage Sunburst Custom Shop Guitar](https://serp.ly/amazon/Gibson+Firebird?utm\_term=1963-gibson-firebird-v-vintage-sunburst-custom-shop-guitar)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Gibson+Firebird?utm_term=1963-gibson-firebird-v-vintage-sunburst-custom-shop-guitar"><img alt="gibson-custom-shop-1963-firebird-v-vos-with-maestro-vintage-sunburst-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gibson-custom-shop-1963-firebird-v-vos-with-maestro-vintage-sunburst-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

This is the Gibson Custom Shop's 1963 Firebird V, and it's a breathtaking piece of machinery. The patina of the Vintage Sunburst finish is absolutely striking, and the nitro lacquer VOS is a thing of beauty. It's like holding a relic from the past, but with all the modern conveniences of today. The body contours, dimensions, and construction are all spot on, providing that unparalleled vintage Firebird in-hand feel. 

One of my favorite features is the Maestro vibrola system, which adds a whole new dimension of playability to the guitar. And let's not forget about the Firebird Alnico V pickups - they capture that sought-after vintage mini-humbucker tone like no other. The 9-ply Mahogany/Walnut neck is a dream, with 22 medium jumbo frets and a hide-glued, 12" radius Indian rosewood fingerboard. It's the perfect blend of old-school charm and modern playability. 

But, as with anything, there are a few negatives. The guitar can be a bit of a finger workout, especially if you're not used to the slim, fast neck profile. And at a price point as high as this, it might not be the most accessible to everyone. But overall, it's a guitar that's worth the investment for any serious collector or player.

The guitar's weight of 8lb 10oz made it comfortable to carry, and the 9-ply Mahogany/Walnut neck-through body gave it a sturdy, solid feel. 

One detail that truly stood out was the Nitrocellulose Lacquer finish, crafted by Tom Murphy's team of expert aging artists. It lent the guitar a gorgeous, aged look that was both visually stunning and musically satisfying. 

Playing this electric guitar was a dream. The 9-ply Mahogany/Walnut neck had a smoothness and warmth that was perfect for my bluesy, folk-inspired tunes. And the mini-humbuckers provided a crisp, bright sound that elevated my performances to new heights. 

However, I did notice that the guitar might require some regular maintenance due to the aging process, which could be a potential drawback for some.
