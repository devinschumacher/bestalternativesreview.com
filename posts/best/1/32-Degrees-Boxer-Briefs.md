### [Fruit of the Loom Breathable Men's Boxer Briefs - Pack of 3 in Large](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/32+Degrees+Boxer+Briefs?utm\_term=fruit-of-the-loom-breathable-mens-boxer-briefs-pack-of-3-in-large)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/32+Degrees+Boxer+Briefs?utm_term=fruit-of-the-loom-breathable-mens-boxer-briefs-pack-of-3-in-large"><img alt="fruit-of-the-loom-bm3p76-breathable-black-grey-boxer-briefs-3-pack-mens-size-large-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fruit-of-the-loom-bm3p76-breathable-black-grey-boxer-briefs-3-pack-mens-size-large-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a frequent user of the Fruit of the Loom Men's Breathable Performance Boxer Briefs, I must say that these boxer briefs have become a game-changer in my underwear game. I've been using them for a while, and the first thing that stood out was the comfort they provide. I love how they snugly hug my legs and never seem to ride up, even after long hours of sitting or moving around. The fabric is soft yet doesn't feel bulky, allowing for easy mobility. 

Another highlight of these boxer briefs is the breathability they offer. Working outdoors in hot weather, I used to suffer from sweaty underwear, but with Fruit of the Loom, I no longer have that issue. I am grateful for the moisture-wicking technology that these shorts incorporate, keeping me dry and fresh all day long. 

However, there are a few things that I would love to see improved. Firstly, the seams in the back of the shorts have been a bit of a letdown. One of the seams unraveled after just one wash, leading to small holes in the butt area. I'm unsure if this is due to the quality of the product or a one-off issue with this particular pair. 

Secondly, the material on these shorts seems to wear out quickly. Though the cotton feels soft and comfortable at first, I've noticed that the material tends to rip over time due to the thinness of the fabric. It would be great if the manufacturer could use a more durable and long-lasting fabric that could withstand the daily wear and tear. 

All in all, the pros of these boxer briefs certainly outweigh the cons. If you're in the market for underwear that provides comfort, breathability, and a snug fit, then look no further than the Fruit of the Loom Men's Breathable Performance Boxer Briefs. 


### [Moisture-Wicking Everlight Men's 12-Pack Boxer Briefs (32-34)](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/32+Degrees+Boxer+Briefs?utm\_term=moisture-wicking-everlight-mens-12-pack-boxer-briefs-32-34)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/32+Degrees+Boxer+Briefs?utm_term=moisture-wicking-everlight-mens-12-pack-boxer-briefs-32-34"><img alt="fruit-of-the-loom-mens-12-pack-everlight-boxer-briefs-breathable-nylon-spandex-blend-medium-32-34-bl-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fruit-of-the-loom-mens-12-pack-everlight-boxer-briefs-breathable-nylon-spandex-blend-medium-32-34-bl-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The functional fly with support is a great addition, providing just the right amount of coverage and making these perfect for any activity. The everlight collection also features an ultra-light moisture wicking functional fly with support. 

That being said, there were a couple of minor issues I faced. Firstly, when ordering from the US, parcels might be subject to import tax and duty charges, which the buyer is responsible to pay. Secondly, while the fabric is comfortable, I noticed that the pictures might not be accurate in terms of sizing, as I had ordered a medium in the expectation of long leg style, but received the short leg version instead. Overall, I had a positive experience with Fruit of the Loom's Everlight Boxer Briefs, but I hope the brand addresses the import tax issue and provides more accurate product images in the future.
