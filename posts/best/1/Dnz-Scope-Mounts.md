### [30mm APNT Micro FDE Scope Mount](https://serp.ly/amazon/Dnz+Scope+Mounts?utm\_term=30mm-apnt-micro-fde-scope-mount)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Dnz+Scope+Mounts?utm_term=30mm-apnt-micro-fde-scope-mount"><img alt="reptilia-rof-90-30mm-apnt-micro-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/reptilia-rof-90-30mm-apnt-micro-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently added the Reptilia ROF-90 30mm APNT Micro FDE 100-109 to my weapon for a bit of versatility. At first, it seemed like a simple upgrade to my original Super Precision 30mm optic mount, but once I installed it, I was blown away by the additional feature it brought. The 90-degree mounting point for an AIMPOINT Micro provided a swift transition to non-magnified optics when I needed to engage targets up close. 

One thing that stood out to me was the ease of installation. It simply dropped into my existing optic mount, and I was ready to go with minimal effort. However, what made it even more impressive was its sturdy construction and durability. I've been using it in training sessions and on the range without it weighing down my weapon or causing any issues. 

On the downside, the Reptilia ROF-90 is a bit pricier than some other mounting options on the market. But, considering the added functionality and the peace of mind it provides, I think it's worth the investment. Overall, it's been a game changer for my close-range target engagements.

Using this 4x28 scope on my Leica Piper Series Pipe Laser 746160 has made my construction projects much smoother and more precise. The fine dial grade adjustments have helped align pipes and poles, and the magnification provides that extra bit of accuracy anyone in this field can appreciate. 

Not to mention the mounting system, which is sturdy and conveniently secured with simple screw holes. Just like the name suggests, it's a real DNZ Scope Mounts addition to my toolkit. 

But, on a negative note, the instructions could have been clearer for a better first-time experience. Overall, it's a worthwhile asset for those faced with challenging environmental conditions.

I recently tried the Granite Tool Design Scope Computer Mount for Specialized Swat Black, and my experience was a bit of a mixed bag. While I appreciate the lightweight design, weighing in at just 15g, it did take me a bit of time to figure out how to use it, as the installation process wasn't quite as straightforward as I would have hoped. 

One feature that stood out to me was the compatibility with Garmin, Wahoo, and Bryton devices. However, I must admit, I encountered some difficulties with my first try, as the mount felt a bit fragile and the plastic component seemed to be damaged right out of the box. I couldn't find any replacement parts for the metal components either, so I was left with a bit of frustration in the end.

The mounts come equipped with a lever mechanism that simplifies the process of detaching the scope minus any tools.

### What distinguishes Weaver and Picatinny scope mounts?

Weaver and Picatinny scope mounts are two of the most popular types of mounts used for rifles. The fundamental distinction between them lies in the base or rail system they are designed to fit. Both types offer secure mounting solutions for scopes and have different advantages depending on the rifle's configuration.

Weaver mounts are specifically designed for use with Weaver scope bases. These bases possess a unique taper and dimension that allows the mount to lock onto the base, providing a firm hold. Weaver mounts are acclaimed for their durability and reliability and are widely employed on rifles featuring a single-piece scope base.

### What is the QD (Quick Detach) feature in Dnz Scope Mounts?

The Quick Detach (QD) feature in Dnz Scope Mounts permits rapid and convenient mounting and dismounting of the scope. This attribute is highly beneficial for hunters or shooters who often swap between various scopes, streamlining the setup and teardown process. The QD mounts incorporate a lever mechanism that allows the scope to be detached without the requirement for any tools.

To utilize the QD feature, simply rotate the lever counterclockwise until the scope is detached. To reattach the scope, slide it back into the mount and rotate the lever clockwise, securing it in place. The QD system has been engineered to provide a robust and secure mounting platform for your scope, and with reduced setup and teardown time, it facilitates the efficient switching between scopes.


### Can I use different scopes with my Dnz Scope Mount?

Yes, Dnz Scope Mounts are designed to be adaptable and can be employed with a variety of scopes. The Weaver, Picatinny, and 1-piece Saddle mounts ensure a secure hold for most standard riflescopes. However, it is crucial to ensure compatibility between the mount and the scope in terms of rail or base dimensions and hole spacing.

When employing different scopes, always confirm that the mounting system is compatible with the specific scope you desire to use. For QD scope mounts, confirm that the scope you wish to use is compatible with the QD system before changing scopes. Dnz Scope Mounts enable easy switching between scopes, empowering you to personalize your rifle and adapt to diverse shooting scenarios as required.
