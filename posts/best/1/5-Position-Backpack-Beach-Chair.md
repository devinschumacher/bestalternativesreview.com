It's a nice touch that adds a level of comfort to the experience. Plus, the contoured wooden armrests are a delight to sit on, providing maximum support for my elbows and forearms. 

The rainbow blue color just makes me happy every time I look at it, and the whole thing feels really durable, even after consistent everyday use. And don't forget, the built-in towel bar is such a handy feature to help keep my wet towel or clothes off of the ground. 

The only downside for me is the chair's tendency to collapse or fold, which can be a bit of a hassle when trying to store it away. But honestly, as long as I'm using it, I have no complaints. This is my go-to beach chair, and I can't imagine going to the beach without it. It's just that perfect!

I've had the pleasure of using Tommy Bahama's Backpack Beach Chair for a while now, and I must say, it has been a lifesaver for beach days. Not only is it super comfortable and versatile with its 5-position lay flat feature, but it's lightweight and made of rustproof, durable materials. The padded shoulder straps, insulated cooler, and even a towel bar are just a few of its standout features. 

However, I must say, the chair's compact size and weight do not make it the most stable when standing or sitting. However, the trade-off is well worth it for its convenience and style.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/5+Position+Backpack+Beach+Chair?utm_term=bass-pro-shops-5-position-backpack-beach-chair"><img alt="bass-pro-shops-backpack-beach-chair-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bass-pro-shops-backpack-beach-chair-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try out the Bass Pro Shops Backpack Beach Chair, and I must say, it's a game changer for those lazy, sun-soaked days at the beach. The first thing I noticed was how lightweight the chair was, despite its sturdy rustproof aluminum frame. 

One of the standout features of this chair is the reclining mechanism. With 5 different positions to choose from, I could easily find a comfortable spot to loung around. The flip-up pillow was a fantastic touch, providing the extra support I need for a full day of relaxing. 

What makes this chair even better? The convenience features, of course! Having a large mesh pocket and multifunction armrests with built-in holders for my phone, drinks, and even a bottle opener made my beach session a breeze. And, with padded shoulder straps, carrying the chair was a total non-issue. 

While it does take up a fair bit of space, 28.35"W x 26"D x 29.5"H, the versatility more than makes up for it. And the maximum weight capacity of 300 lbs gives me added piece of mind. 

Overall, I'm quite pleased with the Bass Pro Shops Backpack Beach Chair. It's sturdy, comfortable, and perfect for those who enjoy spending their downtime at the beach. The only downside, in my opinion, is its weight, but that's a minor quibble for the enjoyment it brings.
