### [Ginger Ray Gold Confetti Balloons Pack](https://serp.ly/amazon/Confetti+Balloons?utm\_term=ginger-ray-gold-confetti-balloons-pack)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Confetti+Balloons?utm_term=ginger-ray-gold-confetti-balloons-pack"><img alt="ginger-ray-confetti-balloons-gold-5-pack-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ginger-ray-confetti-balloons-gold-5-pack-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I had a blast decorating my outdoor party with these gold confetti balloons. They really lit up the space and added a touch of sparkle. But let me tell you, the confetti is a bit of a handful. I had to rub them on the ground to create static electricity and make the confetti stick to the sides of the balloon, which is a bit of a hassle. 

The balloons themselves are adorable and inflate nicely, but I have to admit, they didn't last very long. By the next day, they weren't floating anymore. So, I wouldn't recommend using them for a multi-day event. 

On the bright side, they looked great with some gold letter balloons I had, and the confetti added a nice touch to the decor. But overall, they're a bit of a mixed bag. I had some fun with them, but I don't think I'd buy them again. 


### [Clear Pastel Confetti Balloons by Balloon](https://serp.ly/amazon/Confetti+Balloons?utm\_term=clear-pastel-confetti-balloons-by-balloon)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Confetti+Balloons?utm_term=clear-pastel-confetti-balloons-by-balloon"><img alt="balloon-18-clear-pastel-confetti-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/balloon-18-clear-pastel-confetti-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the pleasure of using the 18" Clear Pastel Confetti Foil Balloon in my own birthday celebration, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations! The stunning pastel colors and confetti inside truly made it the star of the party. One thing that really stood out was its impressive gas capacity, which allowed it to stay inflated for well over a week. 

However, there was a minor drawback that I noticed. Despite being filled with helium, the balloon did lose some air over time. While this wasn't a deal-breaker for me, it's something worth considering for those seeking a longer-lasting option. Overall, I would definitely recommend this balloon to anyone looking for a unique and eye-catching party addition. 


### [Valentine Confetti Red Balloon in 18" Size](https://serp.ly/amazon/Confetti+Balloons?utm\_term=valentine-confetti-red-balloon-in-18-size)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Confetti+Balloons?utm_term=valentine-confetti-red-balloon-in-18-size"><img alt="valentine-confetti-red-18-balloon-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/valentine-confetti-red-18-balloon-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Add a touch of romance to your Valentine's Day with this 18-inch Confetti Red Mylar Balloon. Made with durable Mylar material, it's built to last, adding a hint of excitement to any gathering. The shiny red color and playful confetti design make it the perfect companion for those special dinners or lively parties. 

And because it's filled with helium or air, it's easy to set up and enjoy. Although not everyone may have tried this balloon yet, those who have loved its vibrant color and lasting quality. 


### [New Latex Confetti Balloons - 2ct 24in White](https://serp.ly/amazon/Confetti+Balloons?utm\_term=new-latex-confetti-balloons-2ct-24in-white)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Confetti+Balloons?utm_term=new-latex-confetti-balloons-2ct-24in-white"><img alt="white-confetti-balloons-24in-2ct-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/white-confetti-balloons-24in-2ct-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out one of these 24-inch confetti balloons, and let me tell you – it certainly lived up to the hype! The size of it was nothing short of impressive; imagine the excitement on a child's face upon seeing an enormous balloon filled with confetti. What's more, the quality of the balloon was really quite strong, thanks to it being made from top-grade latex which ensured it kept its structure when being inflated. The tissue confetti was the cherry on top, as it made an incredibly vibrant, white spectacle as it filled the air. 

However, like all good things, this balloon did come with its drawbacks. One of the first, I must admit, was popping quite easily. I suppose it's hard to truly have a fail-safe balloon that never bursts, but this one seemed a little more susceptible than most. Also, I noticed a fair amount of the confetti seemed to sink to the bottom – although that could be fixed with a good shake. 

In the end, this confetti balloon did live up to the excitement that its shape promised. Sure, there may be a few issues here and there, but overall, it's the perfect party addition for any celebration. It's just a shame that they're so tempting to burst! 


### [Burton & Burton Colorful Confetti Balloons for Birthday Celebrations](https://serp.ly/amazon/Confetti+Balloons?utm\_term=burton-burton-colorful-confetti-balloons-for-birthday-celebrations)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Confetti+Balloons?utm_term=burton-burton-colorful-confetti-balloons-for-birthday-celebrations"><img alt="burton-burton-11-inch-birthday-confetti-balloons-pack-7" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/burton-burton-11-inch-birthday-confetti-balloons-pack-7/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Burton & Burton's 11-inch confetti balloons are the perfect addition to any birthday celebration. Over the past few weeks, I've been using these balloons for my daughter's party, and they didn't disappoint. The assortment of vibrant colors and adorable confetti designs are eye-catching and add a festive touch to any room. 

One of the best aspects of using these latex balloons is their durability, which made them a breeze to inflate and tie. However, I found it challenging to find replacement balloons that could match these in quality and design. 

Despite their minor drawbacks, the Burton & Burton confetti balloons are a fun and affordable way to elevate any birthday party. Just be sure to keep adult supervision on hand, and discard any broken balloons promptly. 


### [Vibrant Confetti Tassel Balloon for Parties](https://serp.ly/amazon/Confetti+Balloons?utm\_term=vibrant-confetti-tassel-balloon-for-parties)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Confetti+Balloons?utm_term=vibrant-confetti-tassel-balloon-for-parties"><img alt="spritz-uninflated-confetti-tassel-balloon-target-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/spritz-uninflated-confetti-tassel-balloon-target-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When it comes to sprucing up a space for a celebration, the Spritz Confetti Tassel Balloon is a whimsical choice that's sure to add a playful touch. The large, 36-inch balloon is available in a pale yellow hue with a splash of vibrant colors through its confetti pattern. Turquoise, pink, orange, and green tassels adorn the string, adding extra flair. 

However, buyers should be aware of the balloon's material and its inability to hold helium, as mentioned in several reviews. This shortcoming can lead to disappointment, as seen with users who expected a floating balloon as advertised. On the positive side, the balloon is sturdy enough to last for several days when filled with a liquid or lubricant and tied up as a decoration. The confetti design is also a hit among users, providing a stylish touch to parties without the need for balloon filling. 

While the balloon itself is a fun and eye-catching decoration, some users have commented on the difficulty of tying it, leading to pain and frustration. Others found that the color of the balloon was not as clear or bright as expected. Nonetheless, the Confetti Tassel Balloon remains a quirky and unique option for adding color and pizzazz to any party, with a range of users appreciating its colorful design and versatile usage. 


### [Silver & Gold Confetti Birthday Balloons](https://serp.ly/amazon/Confetti+Balloons?utm\_term=silver-gold-confetti-birthday-balloons)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Confetti+Balloons?utm_term=silver-gold-confetti-birthday-balloons"><img alt="silver-gold-confetti-24-birthday-balloon-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/silver-gold-confetti-24-birthday-balloon-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Silver & Gold Confetti 24" Birthday Balloon, and I must say it was a bit of a mixed experience. The balloon itself looked stunning, with its shiny silver and gold colors shimmering under the sunlight. When I first unboxed it, I was impressed by the size and the confetti design that came with it. 

However, there were a few drawbacks to using this balloon. Firstly, the confetti seemed to be in a perpetual motion, causing the balloon to deflate much faster than I anticipated. It only lasted a few hours before it fell flat to the ground. Secondly, when it came to the helium, it seemed to lose its float much faster than I would have liked, leaving me to inflate it multiple times within the span of just a few hours. 

Despite these issues, I still had a positive experience with the balloon overall. I found it to be a great conversation starter and a unique addition to my birthday decorations. I would recommend this balloon for those who are looking for something that stands out and adds a touch of glamour to their party. However, for those who are looking for a balloon that can withstand the test of time and stay inflated for longer, this one might not be the best choice. 


### [Graduation Confetti Balloons - Latex with 'Follow Your Dreams' Design](https://serp.ly/amazon/Confetti+Balloons?utm\_term=graduation-confetti-balloons-latex-with-follow-your-dreams-design)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Confetti+Balloons?utm_term=graduation-confetti-balloons-latex-with-follow-your-dreams-design"><img alt="graduation-follow-your-dreams-latex-confetti-balloons-6ct-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/graduation-follow-your-dreams-latex-confetti-balloons-6ct-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

These Confetti Balloons are a colorful and fun addition to any graduation party. They come in a set of 6, filled with colorful confetti that's sure to make a statement. 

Although helium isn't included, the flat delivery makes them convenient for storage. Despite some customer issues with deflation time, the overall look and feel of these balloons are definitely impressive and worth considering for your graduation celebration. 


### [Rose Gold Confetti Balloons for Party Decoration](https://serp.ly/amazon/Confetti+Balloons?utm\_term=rose-gold-confetti-balloons-for-party-decoration)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Confetti+Balloons?utm_term=rose-gold-confetti-balloons-for-party-decoration"><img alt="2ct-24in-rose-gold-confetti-balloons-balloons-balloons-by-type-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/2ct-24in-rose-gold-confetti-balloons-balloons-balloons-by-type-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Introducing the Rose Gold Confetti Balloons, the perfect addition to any party decor. These 24-inch tall latex balloons really make a statement with their vibrant color and rose gold confetti. With two balloons per package, you'll have enough to spread the fun around. 

But, there's a catch: Inflating these balloons can be a bit of a challenge. Make sure to inflate them with air to your desired size, or use a combination of helium and air to get them just right. For best results, introduce a bit of static by rubbing your hands or a cloth over the surface of the balloon before dispersing the confetti. 

One key disadvantage of these balloons is their limited lifespan. With Hi-Float treatment, you'll get a 48-hour floating time, but without it, you'll only get 24 hours. Also, be prepared for some quick deflation as one user mentioned that their balloons deflated in just a few hours. 

Overall, the Rose Gold Confetti Balloons are a beautiful way to inject some color into your party. Just be aware of the potential issues with inflation and deflation, and you'll be set for a wonderful time. 


### [Rainbow Confetti Balloon - Perfect for Kid's Birthday Party Decorations](https://serp.ly/amazon/Confetti+Balloons?utm\_term=rainbow-confetti-balloon-perfect-for-kids-birthday-party-decorations)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Confetti+Balloons?utm_term=rainbow-confetti-balloon-perfect-for-kids-birthday-party-decorations"><img alt="rainbow-36-confetti-balloon-by-paperboy-michaels-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rainbow-36-confetti-balloon-by-paperboy-michaels-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the pleasure of using the Rainbow 36" Confetti Balloon by Paperboy from Michaels for a kid's birthday party. The moment I saw it at the store, I was drawn to its vibrant rainbow colors and the thought of having a fun confetti surprise made me excited. 

When I inflated the balloon with air, the confetti did stick to the sides, creating a beautiful display. The balloon itself was made of clear natural latex, which added a touch of elegance and sophistication to the party. As I set up the balloon, I could already feel the anticipation of the party guests as they admired the colorful decoration. 

However, when I filled the balloon with helium, it did have a bit of an issue. The confetti seemed to gather at the bottom, which is a common occurrence when using helium. To remedy this, I gently rubbed the balloon on a dry piece of fabric to create static, which helped the confetti adhere to the sides, making it look as if it was floating perfectly, just like a cloud of colorful butterflies. 

Despite this minor inconvenience, I must say that the Rainbow 36" Confetti Balloon by Paperboy certainly added a magical touch to the party. The tassel tail provided an upscale touch to the whole decoration. I'm definitely considering it for future events, and I highly recommend it for anyone looking to make their party more memorable and fun. 


### [Confetti Latex Balloons with Black, Silver, and Gold](https://serp.ly/amazon/Confetti+Balloons?utm\_term=confetti-latex-balloons-with-black-silver-and-gold)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Confetti+Balloons?utm_term=confetti-latex-balloons-with-black-silver-and-gold"><img alt="latex-balloons-w-confetti-black-silver-gold-25" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/latex-balloons-w-confetti-black-silver-gold-25/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I have to say, these party balloons were a sight to behold! When you see them in their box, they look like innocent little party favors. But when you begin to inflate them, you realize they're actually quite the spectacle. They're a whole 24-inches tall, which not only makes them the focal point at any party, but also the perfect size for kids to chase around. 

One thing I did notice right away was the confetti inside. It may seem like a simple party gimmick, but it's actually an essential part of the balloon's charm. The confetti is evenly dispersed throughout the balloon, so as they float around the room, it creates this lovely little snowstorm effect. It's not just a fun surprise, it's a unique touch that makes these balloons stand out. 

Now, one thing I would say is that they do need to be treated with a bit of care. If you overinflate them, they could burst. And if they're outdoors for too long, the confetti can start to settle at the bottom, making them look less impressive. But really, these balloons are a true party starter. They're a fantastic addition to any celebration, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone planning their own party.

The latex material makes them durable and easy to inflate, while still keeping the event theme. 

However, it's essential to note that these balloons are uninflated and should be filled with a helium/air mix. Be sure to properly dispose of any unused balloons to prevent them from causing damage to powerlines or being released into the air. 

Overall, the Metallic Silver Confetti Balloons are a stylish and fun addition to any event. They're sure to create a memorable atmosphere and impress your guests. 


### [Rainbow Confetti Birthday Balloon with Party Decoration](https://serp.ly/amazon/Confetti+Balloons?utm\_term=rainbow-confetti-birthday-balloon-with-party-decoration)

I had a whimsical time using the Rainbow Confetti Latex Balloons for a birthday party. The size of 24 inches made them a perfect fit for an eye-catching balloon arrangement. The confetti scattered around it added a fun, playful touch to transform the ordinary balloons into a festive decoration for the celebration. 

Although I loved how the balloons looked inflated, their lifespan seemed to be on the shorter side. In my experience, the confetti kept moving, causing the balloon to lose its shape. It left me disappointed during deflation, resulting in confetti streaming everywhere. 

Overall, the balloons were an attractive addition to the party, but they could have been more durable with a longer-lasting helium. 


### [Ginger Ray Team Bride Confetti Balloons](https://serp.ly/amazon/Confetti+Balloons?utm\_term=ginger-ray-team-bride-confetti-balloons)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Confetti+Balloons?utm_term=ginger-ray-team-bride-confetti-balloons"><img alt="ginger-ray-team-bride-confetti-balloons-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ginger-ray-team-bride-confetti-balloons-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

These confetti-filled balloons are a great way to add some pizzazz to an event, with a bright, shiny sheen thanks to their high-quality foil confetti. Crafted from durable high-grade latex for excellent elasticity, these balloons are perfect for adding a touch of magic to any special occasion. 

However, users have pointed out a few shortcomings. The balloons are not always filled with helium, leading to instances of deflation shortly after pickup. Additionally, the confetti tends to settle at the bottom of the balloon, which may be disappointing for some. Though it's essential to note that these confetti-filled balloons might not hold their inflation for as long as regular balloons due to the extra internal weight of the confetti. 

To ensure the best experience, it's recommended to purchase these balloons closer to the event date and follow the proper disposal protocol to minimize potential environmental harm. Overall, if you're looking for a unique and visually appealing addition to your party, the Black Silver Gold Latex Confetti Balloons might just do the trick. Just keep an eye on their inflation and be prepared to handle any deflation issues as they arise!

### [Rainbow Confetti Foil Balloon for Celebrations](https://serp.ly/amazon/Confetti+Balloons?utm\_term=rainbow-confetti-foil-balloon-for-celebrations)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Confetti+Balloons?utm_term=rainbow-confetti-foil-balloon-for-celebrations"><img alt="spritz-rainbow-confetti-foil-balloon-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/spritz-rainbow-confetti-foil-balloon-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When I first saw the shiny, bright balloon, I couldn't help but smile – the smiling yellow sun and rainbow stripes just exude happiness. I was also pleasantly surprised by its somewhat unexpected size; much larger than I anticipated, it really makes a statement when placed at a birthday party or any other special occasion. 

One of the most striking features is how the colors truly pop, adding a vibrancy to any event. While the balloon does require manual inflation, it was a quick and easy process. I was quite impressed with how well it held air for an extended period, which was useful when I took it down for another celebration months later. 

However, one downside was that it did eventually split when it hit a sharp object. Although it was still in good shape after four months, it could have been more durable – but overall, the positives outweighed the negatives. If you're looking for an eye-catching decoration that will add a touch of whimsy to your next celebration, the Spritz Rainbow Confetti Foil Balloon is definitely worth considering.

Despite all these positive aspects, there was one small issue that I noticed. The confetti balloons seemed to lose their flair after a while due to the confetti not sticking well.

Confetti balloons come in various price ranges, from budget-friendly options to more expensive, high-end designs. When setting your budget, consider the number of confetti balloons you need, the type of balloons, and their quality. High-quality confetti balloons may cost more but are typically more durable and vibrant. Shop around for the best deals and compare prices from different sellers to ensure you get the most value for your money. Don't forget to factor in the cost of confetti, if it's not included with the balloon, as well as any additional accessories you may need, such as helium tanks or balloon pumps.

### Additional Considerations

When shopping for confetti balloons, consider the following additional factors: the balloon's material and construction, the quality of the confetti, and the availability of unique or custom designs. Look for balloons made from sturdy materials to prevent leakage and ensure the confetti stays inside when the balloon is punctured. High-quality confetti should be colorful, non-toxic, and made from safe materials. If you're looking for specific designs or color schemes, ask the seller if they offer custom options or if there are any design restrictions. By considering these factors, you can find confetti balloons that meet your needs and create a memorable event.

Confetti balloons are a type of festive balloon stuffed with colorful confetti. They are typically bigger in size than conventional balloons and exhibit a singular design, featuring various small balloons attached to the main one. These balloons have gained popularity due to their fun and visually captivating nature, making them ideal for parties, weddings, and special occasions. 

The striking contrast between confetti balloons and traditional balloons lies in the confetti enclosed within. When the balloon is popped, the confetti is released, creating a vibrant and lively ambiance. Moreover, their larger size and unique design contribute to their visual allure and lasting impression. 


### What are the various types of confetti balloons?

A diverse range of confetti balloons are available in the market, including the following: 
1) Latex balloons crafted from natural latex material that is biodegradable; 
2) Foil balloons fashioned from metallic foil, which imparts a radiant and sophisticated appearance;

### Is it feasible to make confetti balloons at home?

Certainly! Making confetti balloons at home is possible, employing different methods. One such method involves cutting small squares and strips from colored construction paper and stuffing them into a blown-up latex balloon before securing it with a rubber band or ribbon. However, homemade confetti balloons may not be as convenient or visually striking as those purchased from the store. 

Another DIY method entails using a needle and thread to sew confetti pieces onto a balloon prior to inflation. This technique can be time-consuming but offers more precise control over the confetti's arrangement within the balloon. Though store-bought confetti balloons are generally more cost-effective and provide a consistent, professional outcome, homemade options can still be a fun and creative activity. 


### Do confetti balloons offer custom color and design options?

Yes, many confetti balloon suppliers provide custom color and design options for their products. This allows you to match the balloons with the color scheme or theme of your event. Some suppliers even offer personalized or branded confetti balloons with custom messages or logos imprinted on them. 

Customized balloons may be slightly more expensive than off-the-shelf options, but they add a personalized touch to your celebration. To ensure that the custom design aligns with your requirements and maintains high quality, it's vital to work with a reliable and experienced confetti balloon supplier.

### How environmentally friendly are confetti balloons?

Confetti balloons are generally considered an eco-friendly party option due to the natural latex material used. Latex is a biodegradable substance that decomposes quickly in the environment, reducing its impact on wildlife and ecosystems. The metallic foil employed in foil confetti balloons is also recyclable. 

Although confetti balloons can be environmentally friendly, it's crucial to dispose of them responsibly. If confetti or scraps from burst balloons end up in the environment or unclean areas, it can negatively affect wildlife and ecosystems. Always dispose of confetti balloons and their contents in trash cans or compost, adhering to eco-friendly practices. 


### What is the expected lifespan of a confetti balloon?

Confetti balloons generally have a lifespan of around 24-48 hours, depending on factors such as temperature, humidity, and the type of confetti used within the balloon. Latex balloons may endure up to 2 weeks when inflated and shielded from sunlight, but confetti tends to dry out and lose color over time. 

To maximize the shelf life and appeal of confetti balloons, it's essential to store them in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight. Purchasing and inflating confetti balloons close to the event date is also advisable to maintain their freshness and captivating look.
