### [Adesso Bergen Floor Lamp: Mid-Century Modern Black Antique Brass Design](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Adesso+Floor+Lamp?utm\_term=adesso-bergen-floor-lamp-mid-century-modern-black-antique-brass-design)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Adesso+Floor+Lamp?utm_term=adesso-bergen-floor-lamp-mid-century-modern-black-antique-brass-design"><img alt="adesso-bergen-floor-lamp-black-antique-brass-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/adesso-bergen-floor-lamp-black-antique-brass-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the pleasure of using the Adesso Bergen Floor Lamp in my living room, and I must say that it added a wonderful, warm glow to the space. The mid-century modern aesthetic is a great touch, and it fits well with the overall design of my home. The metal base is sturdy, and the shade has a delicate texture that really adds to the overall look. 

One aspect I appreciated was the 3-way rotary switch on the socket, which allows for multiple light settings. However, it's important to note that a 3-way bulb is required for full functionality, otherwise the light will only turn on and off with a standard bulb. The cord length of 5' was sufficient for my needs, but assembly was required and took some time. 

The main issue I faced was the height of the lamp, which seemed a bit shorter than expected. However, it wasn't a significant enough problem for me to return it. Overall, the Adesso Bergen Floor Lamp was a great addition to my home and I would definitely recommend it to others looking for a modern, attractive floor lamp.

Each arm ends with a tapered white plastic shade and an antique brass base, housing a 60W bulb.
