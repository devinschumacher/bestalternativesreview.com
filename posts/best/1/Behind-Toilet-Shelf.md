### [Brightroom Storage: Over The Toilet Brushed Nickel Shelf](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Behind+Toilet+Shelf?utm\_term=brightroom-storage-over-the-toilet-brushed-nickel-shelf)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Behind+Toilet+Shelf?utm_term=brightroom-storage-over-the-toilet-brushed-nickel-shelf"><img alt="over-the-toilet-storage-brushed-nickel-metal-brightroom-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/over-the-toilet-storage-brushed-nickel-metal-brightroom-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Several years ago, I brought home the Over-The-Toilet Storage Rack from Brightroom after seeing it in our local store. What caught my eye was its sleek and stylish design, which I thought would be a perfect fit for our bathroom. 

The first thing I noticed when setting up the rack was the brushed nickel finish. It was a nice touch and blended well with the existing decor in our bathroom. The three open shelves were a space-saving design, which was perfect for storing baskets, bins, and toiletries in one spot. 

As for the construction, it was quite sturdy and felt built to last thanks to the rust-resistant finish. Plus, the anti-tipping wall anchors and adjustable feet made it easy to level and secure the rack in place. 

On the downside, I found the assembly process to be quite challenging. Some of the holes weren't lined up, making it difficult to insert the screws, and the internal threads on the bolts were very fragile. This led to me having to force the screws in, and in some cases, they stripped. 

I also ran into issues with the bottom bar, which didn't account for the lower clearance needed for the toilet's hose. This required me to bend and remove one of the screws to fit it properly. 

In conclusion, the Over-The-Toilet Storage Rack from Brightroom is a functional and stylish addition to any bathroom. However, the assembly process could be less frustrating with better-aligned holes and more durable screws.

### [Rustic Gray Toilet Over-the-Sink Shelf with Adjustable Interior](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Behind+Toilet+Shelf?utm\_term=rustic-gray-toilet-over-the-sink-shelf-with-adjustable-interior)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Behind+Toilet+Shelf?utm_term=rustic-gray-toilet-over-the-sink-shelf-with-adjustable-interior"><img alt="rustic-gray-26-in-w-bathroom-space-saver-better-homes-gardens-over-the-toilet-storage-cabinet-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rustic-gray-26-in-w-bathroom-space-saver-better-homes-gardens-over-the-toilet-storage-cabinet-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

This sleek farmhouse-style cabinet not only fits snugly over my standard toilet, but it also offers ample storage for those essentials you don't want cluttering your bathroom vanity. The two-door cabinet and adjustable interior shelf really come in handy for organizing all those shower essentials, while the open shelf below offers space for additional items. 

I must admit, the rustic gray finish initially caught my eye, but it's the sturdiness of this piece that makes it a real winner. One minor drawback is the assembly process, which took a little longer than expected. However, I found the hardware included in the box was more than sufficient and made the process smoother despite my initial concerns. 

The only downside is that the cabinet itself weighs quite a bit, so moving it around can be a bit of a hassle. But after having this Beauty around for a few months now, I'm happy with the space it's saving and the overall look it brings to the room. I wouldn't trade the extra closet space for anything, even the extra effort it takes to relocate the cabinet. 

In the end, the space saver from Better Homes & Gardens does its job and looks fantastic doing it. With a bit of patience and some elbow grease during assembly, it's a worthwhile addition to any bathroom, and I'm glad I made the choice to go with this one.

## FAQ


### What is a Hidden Toilet Storage Solution?

A Hidden Toilet Storage Solution refers to a decorative organizational system designed to be installed behind the toilet, offering functional and stylish convenience to your restroom. These designs allow you to store toiletries, cleaning supplies, or other accessories with ease, keeping the area clutter-free and orderly. They come in a variety of materials, dimensions, and designs, enabling you to choose the one that best suits your preferences and bathroom theme. 

Most Hidden Toilet Storage Solutions are crafted from materials such as plastic, metal, or wood, ensuring durability and water resistance. The installation process typically involves mounting the shelf to the wall using brackets or adhesive strips, enabling it to remain securely against the wall without further support from the bathroom fixtures. 


### Why should I choose a Hidden Toilet Storage Solution?

There are several reasons why a Hidden Toilet Storage Solution can be a fantastic addition to your bathroom. Firstly, these designs provide additional storage capacity without occupying valuable floor or counter space. This is particularly beneficial in smaller or narrower bathrooms where floor space may be limited. 

Secondly, a Hidden Toilet Storage Solution helps keep your bathroom tidy and organized by keeping essential items within easy reach. With everything in one place, you can prevent items from being scattered throughout the bathroom, making it easier to clean and maintain. Moreover, having everything at your fingertips can save time as you won't have to search for specific items. 


### What materials are Hidden Toilet Storage Solutions made from?

Hidden Toilet Storage Solutions are typically manufactured from materials such as plastic, metal, or wood. Plastic and metal shelves are generally lightweight and more affordable, making them popular choices for those on a budget. However, they may not be as moisture-resistant as other materials, which could result in rust or discoloration over time. 

Wooden shelves, on the other hand, provide a more traditional and elegant appearance, but they may require additional maintenance to prevent warping or rotting. It's crucial to clean and dry the shelf regularly, especially if your bathroom is frequently exposed to moisture or humidity, to ensure its longevity. 


### Are Hidden Toilet Storage Solutions easy to install?

Yes, most Hidden Toilet Storage Solutions are designed to be user-friendly and easy to install, even for those without extensive DIY experience. Typically, the installation process involves securing the shelf to the wall using brackets or adhesive strips. The shelf will then be mounted on the wall behind the toilet, with the brackets or strips ensuring it stays securely against the wall without the need for additional support. 

Some Hidden Toilet Storage Solutions come with detailed installation instructions, making the process even more straightforward. It's essential to read and follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully to guarantee a successful installation and proper functioning of the shelf. Additionally, using an extra stud anchor or a power drill can further enhance the shelf's stability. 


### What size of Hidden Toilet Storage Solution should I choose?

The size of the Hidden Toilet Storage Solution you should opt for depends on your specific needs and the available space behind your toilet. Most shelves come in standard widths, but it's crucial to measure the distance behind your toilet and consider the items you plan to store before making a selection. Be sure to take the shelf's depth into account as well, as this will determine how much space it takes up in your bathroom. 

Choose a shelf with a taller design if you need to store tall items such as toilet paper or cleaning supplies. Conversely, select a narrower shelf if space is limited or if you anticipate storing more narrow items. Always check the product's dimensions before making a purchase to ensure the specified shelf aligns with your requirements. 


### What design options are available for Hidden Toilet Storage Solutions?

Hidden Toilet Storage Solutions come in a wide range of designs and styles, catering to different preferences and bathroom d√©cors. They are typically crafted from materials such as plastic, metal, or wood, with options for glossy, matte, or brushed finishes available for metal or wood shelves to enhance their appearance. Some shelves even feature decorative edges for added visual appeal. 

Design elements like adjustable shelves, dividers, or dividers slots can be helpful for organizing items and ensuring ease of use. Furthermore, certain Hidden Toilet Storage Solutions have built-in features such as hooks or holders for items like toilet brushes, toothbrushes, or even tissues.
