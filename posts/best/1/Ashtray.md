### [Portable Ashtray with LED for Smoking Control](https://serp.ly/amazon/Ashtray?utm\_term=portable-ashtray-with-led-for-smoking-control)

### [Goody Glass Co. Clear Goody Day Ashtray](https://serp.ly/amazon/Ashtray?utm\_term=goody-glass-co-clear-goody-day-ashtray)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Ashtray?utm_term=goody-glass-co-clear-goody-day-ashtray"><img alt="goody-glass-co-goody-day-ashtray-in-clear-at-urban-outfitters-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/goody-glass-co-goody-day-ashtray-in-clear-at-urban-outfitters-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who enjoys a good smoke-break, I decided to give the Goody Day Ashtray a try, expecting a stylish and functional accessory. Unfortunately, it turned out to be quite the opposite. The ashtray, made of resin, felt cheap and flimsy in my hands. 

The highlight of this ashtray was its Have A Good Day slogan, which added a nice touch to the design. The raised edges and dips around the sides were decent features for supporting essentials, but they weren't enough to save this product from being a disappointment. 

The main issue I faced was the durability of the product. The ashtray turned black after just a few uses, which made it look dirty and unhygienic. It was a major disappointment, especially when considering the price point. 

In conclusion, the Goody Day Ashtray was not worth the investment. The low-quality resin and lack of durability made it a waste of money. While it had a couple of positive features, the negatives far outweighed them, leaving me with a negative experience overall. 


### [Cozy Ash Tray for Fireplace Cleanup](https://serp.ly/amazon/Ashtray?utm\_term=cozy-ash-tray-for-fireplace-cleanup)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Ashtray?utm_term=cozy-ash-tray-for-fireplace-cleanup"><img alt="fireplace-ash-tray-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fireplace-ash-tray-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As the winter chill sets in, nothing beats huddling around a cozy, crackling fireplace. But, as a proud owner of a beloved fireplace, I've found that dealing with the aftermath - the ashen mess - isn't exactly the highlight of the evening. It's time-consuming, messy, and lets not forget, it gets everywhere. Enter the Fireplace Ash Tray, my knight in shining armor. 

I was initially a bit hesitant, as the photo depicted a rather small, trapezoidal-shaped tray. However, with its expandable design, it ended up fitting my fireplace quite nicely. With a little bit of adjustment, it fit snugly, effectively catching every bit of flying ash and coals. 

The tray itself is made of durable, rust-resistant 22-gauge, cold-rolled steel, perfect for its intended purpose. Cleanup was a breeze, with no messy, smelly buckets, brooms, or shovels needed. It even helped redistribute heat, adding a little extra warmth to the space. 

However, as with any product, the Fireplace Ash Tray isn't without its minor drawbacks. A more honest depiction in the product's photo would have been greatly appreciated, and the size isn't exactly compact, making storage a bit of a challenge. But these small quibbles aside, this ash tray has become a valuable addition to my winter routine, providing a cleaner, cozier home.

## Buyer's Guide

When it comes to buying an ashtray, there are several factors to consider to ensure you get the best product for your needs. In this buyer's guide, we will provide you with essential information and advice to help you make an informed decision. 


### Important Features

1. Material: Ashtrays are typically made of materials like glass, ceramic, metal, or plastic. Each material has its pros and cons. For example, glass ashtrays are easy to clean and maintain, but they can be fragile, while metal ashtrays are durable and resistant to heat, but they may not look as appealing. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Ashtray"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Ashtray-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Ashtray-2" height="540"></a></div>


### Considerations

1. Size: The size of the ashtray should be appropriate for the space where it will be placed and the number of cigarettes you smoke. A larger ashtray can hold more ash and cigarettes, but a smaller one may be more suitable for a confined space or a smoker who smokes fewer cigarettes. Consider the depth of the ashtray as well, as a deeper tray can better contain tobacco ash and prevent it from spilling out. 


### General Advice

1. Maintenance: Regularly clean your ashtray to prevent the buildup of ash and to ensure it remains functional. You can use a damp cloth to gently scrub the interior and exterior surfaces. Some ashtrays are dishwasher-safe, which makes cleaning easier, but check the manufacturer's instructions before attempting to clean it in a dishwasher.

### Additional Features

1. Aspiration: Some ashtrays feature built-in aspiration systems, which help to reduce odor and smoke by drawing air through a filter. These types of ashtrays can be more convenient for smokers who want to minimize the lingering smell of tobacco in their home or car. Consider investing in an ashtray with an aspiration system if you are concerned about the smell that cigarettes can leave behind.

### What should I consider when choosing an ashtray?

When selecting an ashtray, several factors should be taken into account to ensure that it meets your requirements. First and foremost, consider the size of the ashtray - a larger ashtray can accommodate more cigarette butts and require fewer emptying sessions. Additionally, the material of the ashtray may affect its durability and maintenance requirements. For instance, glass ashtrays are generally easy to clean, while ceramic ashtrays may require more effort and care. 

Another essential factor is the ashtray's design and appearance. Consider which type of ashtray would best suit your decor and style preferences. Finally, do not forget about the ease of use and convenience - a well-designed ashtray should have an ergonomic shape and be easy to empty without making a mess. 


### Are ashtrays made of glass safe to use?

Yes, ashtrays made of glass are generally safe to use, provided they are designed for that purpose and manufactured with appropriate quality standards. Glass ashtrays usually have a thick coating of lead to increase durability and reduce the likelihood of breaking. Additionally, some glass ashtrays have ribbed or textured surfaces to enhance their grip and increase their functionality. 

However, it is essential to handle and dispose of glass ashtrays with care, as they can still break if dropped or subjected to sudden impact. To ensure safety, avoid placing a glass ashtray on an uneven surface or near small children and pets. Regular cleaning and maintenance should also be performed to prevent accidents and maintain the ashtray's appearance and functionality. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Ashtray"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Ashtray-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Ashtray-6" height="540"></a></div>


### What is the best way to clean an ashtray?

The best way to clean an ashtray depends on the material it is made from. For glass ashtrays, simply fill the ashtray with hot soapy water, add a few ice cubes to gently scrub away any debris, and then rinse it thoroughly. If there are any stubborn stains, you can use a mixture of baking soda and water to clean the affected areas. 

For ceramic or metal ashtrays, you should avoid using harsh chemicals, as this can damage the surface and make it more prone to staining. Instead, use a soft sponge or cloth and warm soapy water to wipe the ashtray clean. If there are stubborn stains, you can use a mixture of vinegar and water or a mild abrasive cleaner designed for ceramic surfaces. 


### How often should I empty my ashtray?

The frequency of emptying your ashtray depends on the volume of cigarette butts it contains and how often it is used. As a general guideline, it is recommended to empty the ashtray at least once a day to prevent overflow and maintain hygiene. In households where multiple people smoke, or when hosting events with many guests, it may be necessary to empty the ashtray more frequently to keep up with the demand. 

Consider factors such as the size of the ashtray and the volume of smokers in your household when determining the ideal emptying schedule. By properly managing your ashtray's emptiness, you can minimize the risk of fire and ensure a clean and pleasant smoking environment for all concerned parties. Remember to thoroughly wash or replace the ashtray when necessary, to maintain its functionality and appearance.
