### [Eastpak Tecum Green Backpack with Laptop Pocket](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Eastpak+Backpack?utm\_term=eastpak-tecum-green-backpack-with-laptop-pocket)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Eastpak+Backpack?utm_term=eastpak-tecum-green-backpack-with-laptop-pocket"><img alt="eastpak-tecum-top-backpack-green-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/eastpak-tecum-top-backpack-green-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Imagine your daily commute - books, laptop, wallet, and more all crammed into your oversized tote. It's a mess, right? That's why the Eastpak Tecum top backpack revolutionized my routine. With its olive green appearance and logo patch, it's more than just a bag; it's a statement. 

One of the key features that stood out was the internal laptop pocket. I can fit my 14-inch MacBook Pro without any hassle. The front zip fastening pockets came in handy too, holding all sorts of small essentials. The all-around zip fastening and slip pockets along the sides were useful, but the rear zip-fastening pocket really caught my attention. It's perfect for things you don't need to access frequently but always want nearby. 

The padded adjustable shoulder strap was a game-changer. It's comfortable, even when carrying a heavy load, and the main compartment provides ample space for everything. However, the build quality isn't flawless. The bottom could be more sturdy, and I felt my things bulging out a bit. But overall, the Tecum top backpack is a reliable companion for any urban commute.

I recently gave the Eastpak Floid CS a try, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for my daily commutes and weekend trips. With hidden pockets, key clips, and a convenient bottle holder, I never have to worry about missing or misplacing my belongings. The backpack's adjustable S-shaped shoulder straps and chest straps make it a breeze to wear, even when it's packed to the brim. 

One of my favorite features is the padded back panel and shoulder straps, combined with the sternum strap, which ensures a comfortable fit no matter the weight. The large main compartment, complete with a padded laptop sleeve for up to 15 inches, has more than enough space for all my essentials. Plus, at a height of 48 cm, this backpack is perfect for both my height and the various activities I use it for. 

While there's nothing perfect, my only minor nitpick is that the Eastpak Floid CS could perhaps be a bit larger in size. Otherwise, this backpack has been a fantastic and reliable addition to my daily life.

One feature I found particularly convenient was the bottle holder, perfect for carrying my favorite beverage on the go. Additionally, the backpack's 100% vegan nature is a commendable aspect, as it's made without using any animal products. 

However, there were a couple of drawbacks I encountered. The backpack is slightly heavier than I would have preferred, and the double back and inside laptop pocket make it slightly cumbersome. Furthermore, the water bottle pocket is a bit too small, only accommodating thin bottles. 

Overall, the Eastpak Parton backpack is a great choice for those seeking a spacious, versatile, and stylish backpack. Its vegan nature is a bonus for environmentally-conscious individuals.

I recently tried the Eastpak Day Pak'R 24L Backpack in a vibrant animal print and I must say, it exceeded my expectations. The backpack is made of 100% polyester, making it durable and suitable for outdoor adventures. The padded back panel and adjustable shoulder straps made it comfortable to wear and carry, even when it was full. 

One of the standout features of this backpack is the built-in laptop sleeve, which kept my device safe and secure. The main compartment has a front pocket with a zipper closure, and a rear security pocket, ensuring that my belongings were always protected. The two multifunctional side pockets were perfect for stashing my water bottle or other small items. 

However, I did notice that the zippers seemed a bit weak and might not last as long as I would have liked. Additionally, the bottom of the backpack got dirty fairly quickly, even though I took good care of it. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the Eastpak Day Pak'R 24L Backpack for its durability, convenience, and stylish design. Just be aware that the zippers might not be as sturdy as you would expect, and be prepared to clean the bottom frequently to keep it looking new.

I fell in love with my Eastpak Volker backpack from the moment I unzipped it and saw the spacious compartments. It's like a roomy home for all my odds and ends, and fits perfectly in a car's trunk on weekend getaways. While I don't use it specifically as a laptop bag, it's great for carrying a large water bottle or a novel or two. It's also comfortable to wear, with enough padding in the shoulder straps to make carrying my load feel like a breeze. 

The only issue I had was with the leather detailing. It started looking a bit scruffy after a few weeks of use. Other than that, I'm really happy with my Eastpak Volker.
