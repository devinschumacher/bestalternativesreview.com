### [Progressive Butter Keeper - Wide](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Butter+Keeper?utm\_term=progressive-butter-keeper-wide)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Butter+Keeper?utm_term=progressive-butter-keeper-wide"><img alt="progressive-butter-keeper-wide-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/progressive-butter-keeper-wide-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who loves to bake, I recently tried the Progressive Butter Keeper Wide to store and portion my butter. The first thing I noticed was its sturdy, non-slip base that allowed me to easily scoop the butter right from the container. The clear lid with silicone seal was another feature I appreciated, as it allowed me to see exactly how much butter I had left. 

One of the highlights of this butter keeper is the included measurement markings for short and long sticks of butter, up to 8 tablespoons. This was perfect for me because I could easily portion the butter out according to the recipe I was using. Plus, the tablespoon measurement guides on the sides were extremely handy for ensuring accurate measurements. 

However, there were a couple of cons I noticed with this product. While the butter keeper works fine for storage, some users might need to exert a bit of force to open it. But overall, I found this handy tool to be a great addition to my kitchen. It's also BPA-free and dishwasher safe, which is always a bonus when dealing with food storage containers. High quality product!

Oh boy, I just got my hands on this DOWAN porcelain butter pot and I'm in love! It keeps my butter soft and spreadable all day without needing to be refrigerated. The sleek design looks amazing on my countertop, and the stain-resistant coating has kept it looking as good as new. 

I've had a bit of a hard time with it though, the container itself is quite small, so I have to refill it more often than I'd like. And there's a tiny hole on the side of the lid that fills with water during dishwasher cycles, which can be a bit annoying to empty.

### What Makes a Butter Keeper Special?

The Butter Keeper is a unique food storage solution designed specifically for keeping butter fresh at room temperature. Comprised of two essential components - a removable inner jar and a tightly sealed outer container, this innovative container successfully regulates temperature and prevents spoilage. Many Butter Keepers feature additional perks, such as airtight seals and insulation, to guarantee your butter remains fresh for prolonged periods compared to traditional storage options.

Storing butter in a Butter Keeper grants you the convenience of counter storage without the need for refrigeration.

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Butter+Keeper"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Butter-Keeper-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Butter-Keeper-5" height="540"></a></div>


### How Does a Butter Keeper Work?

A Butter Keeper functions through a combination of insulation, airtight sealing, and advanced temperature regulation systems. The inner jar is made from a material that helps maintain a consistent temperature, while the outer container is usually crafted from ceramic or glass, providing efficient insulation to sustain that temperature. This prevents butter from melting or hardening excessively.

The airtight sealing system plays a pivotal role in keeping butter fresh by preventing air and moisture from interacting with the butter. This slows down the oxidation process that leads to spoilage, allowing the butter to maintain its freshness for an extended period. Overall, a Butter Keeper effectively stores and maintains the quality of butter, even at room temperature.

Using a Butter Keeper offers numerous advantages, including extended freshness, convenience, and cost savings. Firstly, the airtight sealing and insulating properties of the Butter Keeper help keep the butter fresh for a significantly longer period than traditional storage methods, such as refrigeration. 

Secondly, by storing the butter in a Butter Keeper on your kitchen counter, you can effortlessly access it whenever you need it without the need to access the refrigerator. This convenience is particularly beneficial for those who frequently use butter in their daily cooking or baking activities. Additionally, it eliminates the need to constantly move butter between the refrigerator and your cooking space, which can be time-consuming and inconvenient.


### Can Other Dairy Products Be Stored in a Butter Keeper?

Absolutely! You can store various dairy products, such as cheese and yogurt, in a Butter Keeper. The purpose of using a Butter Keeper is to maintain the freshness and quality of the product, which applies to dairy products in general. However, some products, like milk or cream, may still require refrigeration even when stored in a Butter Keeper.

Always refer to the product's specific storage guidelines before storing it in a Butter Keeper. This will help ensure that your dairy products remain fresh and safe to consume. Generally, storing dairy products in a Butter Keeper can help prolong their freshness and provide a more natural and convenient storage option in your kitchen.


### What Should You Avoid Putting in a Butter Keeper?

To guarantee the best possible results and maintain the freshness of your dairy products, avoid storing certain items in a Butter Keeper. Firstly, refrain from storing products with expiration dates or those that have been opened for an extended period, as these items may have already started to spoil and could contaminate other stored items.

Secondly, it is also not recommended to use the Butter Keeper for storing products with strong smells or flavors. These odors and flavors may transfer to other stored dairy products. The primary purpose of using a Butter Keeper is to maintain the freshness of dairy products, and introducing anything that could compromise this freshness would defeat the purpose.


### What Materials Are Commonly Used to Make a Butter Keeper?

Butter Keepers are typically crafted from materials that provide effective insulation and airtight sealing properties. Common materials include ceramic, glass, and stainless steel. These materials are chosen for their ability to maintain temperature, maintain airtight sealing, and resist odor absorption.

Ceramic and glass Butter Keepers rely on their insulating properties to maintain the butter's temperature. These containers often have a heavy, tightly sealed lid and a wide base that allows the butter to remain in contact with the ceramic or glass material, which helps keep it fresh. Stainless steel Butter Keepers, on the other hand, offer a more durable and easier-to-clean option. They often have a vacuum seal to create an airtight environment, which helps extend the butter's freshness.
