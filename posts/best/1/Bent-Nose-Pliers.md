However, there's one thing I wish wasn't a part of this package â€“ the jaws' smoothness.

The soft cushioned foam grips are a nice touch though, making the pliers comfortable to grip and use for extended periods. 

Overall, the Excelta Pliers are a handy tool to have in your toolbox, but I can't help but feel that they could benefit from a bit more grip and security.

### [Pittsburgh 45Â° Bent Nose Long Reach Pliers](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Bent+Nose+Pliers?utm\_term=pittsburgh-45-bent-nose-long-reach-pliers)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Bent+Nose+Pliers?utm_term=pittsburgh-45-bent-nose-long-reach-pliers"><img alt="pittsburgh-11-in-45-bent-nose-long-reach-pliers-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/pittsburgh-11-in-45-bent-nose-long-reach-pliers-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a car owner, I have had to deal with a number of annoying tasks that required long-reach pliers. Recently, I stumbled upon these Bent Nose Long Reach Pliers from Pittsburgh, and I have to say, they have been a game changer. The first thing that stands out is their construction. They are made of high strength steel, which ensures they are sturdy and built to withstand daily use. 

One of my biggest frustrations with traditional needle nose pliers is the difficulty of getting into tight, narrow spaces. These pliers, however, have a 45-degree bent nose that allows for much greater reach. It's a small feature but has made a big difference in my ability to complete tasks without breaking a sweat. 

Another great feature of these pliers is their 9-inch long handle. This means I can keep my hands a safe distance away from whatever I'm working on, reducing the risk of injury. There are times when I need to apply a lot of pressure, especially when dealing with stubborn nuts and bolts. The long handle allows me to do this without putting too much strain on my hands. 

However, no product is perfect. I've found that the Bent Nose Long Reach Pliers from Pittsburgh are not the best choice when it comes to heavy-duty tasks. The pliers can bend quite easily under pressure and are not the most durable. Additionally, some users have found the quality of the product to be questionable, with variations in the shape and finish of the pliers. 

In summary, these Bent Nose Long Reach Pliers from Pittsburgh are a handy tool to have around the house or garage. They are durable enough for most tasks but may not be the best choice for heavy-duty usage.

Constructed of high-quality, drop-forged steel, they provided a smooth and reliable operation, thanks to their interlocking spring mechanism. The nonslip comfort grips were a nice touch, making the tool easier to handle and maneuver in tricky situations. 

One of the standout features of these pliers was their ability to access obstructed fasteners with ease. Their bent design allowed me to reach tight spaces and awkwardly positioned screws that I would have struggled with using standard needle nose pliers. However, I did notice that the size of the pliers was slightly larger than I expected, which might make them less ideal for some smaller tasks. 

While the pliers performed well in most situations, I did encounter a few hiccups along the way. On a few occasions, the pliers seemed to bind up or became difficult to operate, requiring some extra effort to loosen them. Additionally, I found that the comfort grips started to wear off after extended use, leading to a less comfortable grip. 

Overall, these bent long nose pliers were a useful addition to my toolbox, and I appreciated their ability to tackle tasks that would have been more challenging with standard needle nose pliers.

### What materials are Bent Nose Pliers made of?

Bent nose pliers come in a variety of materials, each with its own advantages. The most common materials include steel, which provides strength and durability, and nickel, silver, or gold-plated alloys that can reduce friction and enhance the pliers' appearance. Copper is another material used for bent nose pliers, offering both strength and resistance to corrosion. 

While steel is generally the most affordable option, it may not be the best choice for everyone. Those working with delicate materials or in corrosive environments may prefer nickel, silver, or gold-plated alloys, which tend to be more resistant and easier to work with. Ultimately, the choice of material will depend on the user's needs, budget, and intended application. 


### Are there any safety concerns when using Bent Nose Pliers?

As with any hand tool, there are certain safety precautions to take when using bent nose pliers. First and foremost, always wear protective gloves to prevent any cuts or blisters from sharp edges or points. Ensure that the pliers are clean and free of any oils or contaminants that may transfer onto the material being worked on. 

When using bent nose pliers to cut or de-solder components, be mindful of the soldering iron's tip temperature. Overheating the tip can lead to burns or damage to the pliers themselves. Additionally, take care when twisting or bending wires, as excessive force may cause the wire to break or become damaged. Finally, always store your bent nose pliers in a safe and designated location to prevent accidents or damage in storage. 


### How do I choose the right Bent Nose Pliers for my needs?

To choose the right bent nose pliers, consider the following factors: the type of material you will be working with, the size of the pliers (in relation to the objects you need to manipulate), and the desired level of pressure for your application. For example, if you will be working with delicate materials, you may prefer nickel, silver, or gold-plated alloys that are less likely to scratch or mar the surface. 

Additionally, consider the overall size of the pliers in relation to the objects you need to manipulate. If you will be working on small, intricate designs, you may prefer a smaller-sized plier with a narrower jaw. For larger components or in situations where more pressure is needed, a larger plier with a wider jaw and thicker, stronger material may be more appropriate. 


### Are there any Bent Nose Pliers that are suitable for left-handed users?

Yes, bent nose pliers are available in a variety of designs to suit both left-handed and right-handed users. Look for pliers with an adjustable handle or one that is designed to work in both directions. Some manufacturers even offer specific lines of bent nose pliers that are designed for left-handed users. When choosing the right pair of pliers, be sure to read the product descriptions to understand the handle design and ensure it will be comfortable and effective for your needs. 

In addition to considering the handle design, pay attention to the overall shape and size of the pliers. Some bent nose pliers have a straight handle that is suitable for both left-handed and right-handed users, while others have an angled handle that may be more comfortable for some users. Choose a plier that fits your hand well and provides the necessary grip and control for your work. 


### How do I care for and maintain my Bent Nose Pliers?

To keep your bent nose pliers in good working condition, it is essential to provide regular maintenance and care. Always clean your pliers before and after use to remove any dirt, oil, or debris that may have accumulated on the surface. This will help prevent damage to the material and ensure a safe working environment. 

Additionally, regularly check your pliers for any signs of wear, such as cracks, rust, or a loosening of the handle. If you notice any issues, have your bent nose pliers repaired or replaced as necessary to maintain their functionality. Finally, store your bent nose pliers in a safe, dry location when not in use to prevent damage or contamination from exposure to moisture or other elements.
