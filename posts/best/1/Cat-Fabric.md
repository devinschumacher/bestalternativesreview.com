### How do I clean cat hair off of my cat fabric products?

Cat hair can be a bit of a challenge to remove from cat fabric products, but there are a few methods you can try to get it off. Here are some tips on how to clean cat hair off of your cat fabric products: 
1. Use a lint roller, which is specifically designed for removing pet hair from fabrics. Simply roll the lint roller over the cat hair, and it will lift the hair off the fabric. Be sure to clean the lint roller after use, as the hair may stick to it. 

2. Use a vacuum with a brush attachment, which can help to suck up and remove cat hair from fabric surfaces. Make sure to use a soft-bristle attachment to avoid damaging the fabric or design. 3. If you don't have a lint roller or vacuum, you can try using a damp, soft-bristled brush or a rubber glove to gently remove the cat hair. Rubber gloves are particularly good for removing cat hair, as the texture of the glove helps to lift the hair off the fabric. 4. Another option is to use a sticky tape, such as a painter's tape or a tape measure, to gently lift and remove cat hair from the fabric. Make sure to remove the tape after use, as cat hair may stick to it.
