Imagine soaring through the air with the Flywoo BNF Firefly, a pocket-sized drone that's perfect for those on-the-go adventures. I recently tried it out for myself, and let me tell you – it was no small feat! The first thing I noticed upon receiving it was its compact size, fitting neatly into the palm of my hand – a true testament to modern drone technology. 

One of the main features that stood out to me was the redesigned canopy. Not only does it enhance the aesthetic appeal of the drone, but it also adds an extra layer of protection for its built-in camera. It was refreshing to have both style and substance working in harmony. 

As I began my first flight, I was immediately impressed by its stability in the air, a feat I attribute to the sturdy bottom plate with extended motor protection corners.

However, there were a few aspects I'd like to see improved. The drone's 20°C~+60C Work Humidity range and 40%~80% weight should ideally be adjusted to cater to a wider temperature and weight spectrum to accommodate a broader user base. Additionally, compatibility with external transmitters and better connectivity options would be an added bonus.
