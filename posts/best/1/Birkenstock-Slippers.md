Moreover, despite my initial struggles with the size, they seemed to conform perfectly to my feet over time. This process took a couple of weeks, but the final product was worth the wait. The footbed, despite being thick and plush, never felt too soft or too hard on my feet, just right.

As a Birkenstock enthusiast, I was excited to try their first true slipper, the Zermatt. The blend of soft genuine wool, cozy cork latex footbed, and genuine shearling lining promised a luxurious and warm experience for winter slipper wearers. The first thing that caught my attention was the classic look of the slipper, which was true to Birkenstock's iconic style. 

However, what stood out to me the most was the comfortable and supportive design of the footbed.

The removable cork and latex footbed also gave my feet some much-needed relief as I walked around the house. 

One downside I encountered was the noise level of the slippers. Since they are slip-on shoes, my footsteps were quite loud on hard surfaces, which wasn't exactly ideal for my household. However, this issue was relatively minor compared to the overall comfort that the Zermatt slipper provided. 

Another feature that I appreciated was the durability of the product. Despite wearing the slippers regularly, they remained in excellent condition, not showing signs of wear and tear that some other slippers I have had in the past would show. 

Overall, the Birkenstock Zermatt Shearling Slipper is a comfortable, supportive, and durable slipper option that I would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone seeking an elegant yet practical pair of slippers for the winter season.

I was pleasantly surprised when I first wore these Birkenstock slippers. The soft, yet durable suede upper felt like a warm hug around my feet, while the lambskin fur inner gave me a sense of luxury.

This feature came in handy when I had to work at my desk for long hours â€“ the arch support and cushioning kept my feet feeling great. 

However, there was one downside that eventually became noticeable: the shearling started to wear down quite quickly. It's a shame because the slippers looked and felt fantastic when they were new. I also noticed that some users had issues with sizing, with some finding them too big.

### [Birkenstock Andermatt Wool Felt Slippers in Green](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Birkenstock+Slippers?utm\_term=birkenstock-andermatt-wool-felt-slippers-in-green)

### [Comfortable Birkenstock Mocha Zermatt Felt Slippers with Cork-Latex Footbed](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Birkenstock+Slippers?utm\_term=comfortable-birkenstock-mocha-zermatt-felt-slippers-with-cork-latex-footbed)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Birkenstock+Slippers?utm_term=comfortable-birkenstock-mocha-zermatt-felt-slippers-with-cork-latex-footbed"><img alt="birkenstock-mocha-zermatt-felt-slippers-41-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/birkenstock-mocha-zermatt-felt-slippers-41-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

These Birkenstock slippers have been a great addition to my daily routine. The wool felt uppers are super soft and cozy, making them perfect for lounging around the house. The suede lining also adds to the comfort, creating a snug fit without any irritation. However, the cork-latex footbed takes some getting used to, as it's quite different from the typical foam insoles most slippers come with. 

One of the defining features of these slippers is their ability to switch between three different footbed options: Standard, Soft, and Shearling. It's a great feature for those who want to customize their footbed experience. However, the Shearling footbed seems to be quite durable, as it wore away after only a month of use. While Birkenstock says it's normal because the material is natural, I found it disappointing considering the price. 

The slippers are made in Germany, which adds to their prestige and quality. They're lightweight, so walking around the house is effortless, and they provide enough traction on hard floor surfaces. Unfortunately, the noise level is a bit high, as the slippers make a squeaking sound when walked on. 

Overall, these Birkenstock slippers were a comfortable and supportive choice for my daily life. The ability to switch footbeds is a great feature, but the durability of the Shearling option was a letdown. I would recommend them for those who want a cozy, supportive slipper, but may want to consider a different option for the footbed.

## FAQ


### Are Birkenstock slippers your best footwear option?

Indeed, Birkenstock slippers have gained quite a reputation for their comfort. Among the features that make them popular is their cork footbed, molded with natural contours to provide top-notch arch support. This design aspect makes them a suitable choice for all-day wear. Moreover, the slippers are made from soft and breathable materials that contribute to their overall comfort.

Thanks to this feature, you can achieve a snug and comfortable fit that adjusts to your unique foot shape.

Birkenstock slippers may be renowned for their comfort, but they also come with additional perks. The cork footbeds are designed to maintain good posture and foot alignment, potentially reducing problems like plantar fasciitis or heel spurs. Additionally, they are made of eco-friendly materials, free from toxic chemicals found in many slippers, making them a healthier choice. Furthermore, they have excellent moisture-wicking properties, keeping your feet dry and comfortable, and preventing bacteria and fungus buildup.

No, they are versatile and suitable for all situations. They can be used in semi-formal settings, and even dressed up for a more elegant look. The brand provides various designs and colors to cater to different fashion preferences. Their comfortable design and functionality make them suitable for both indoor and outdoor activities.
