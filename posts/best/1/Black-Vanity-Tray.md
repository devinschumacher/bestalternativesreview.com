Size is an essential factor when selecting a black vanity tray. Consider not only the dimensions of your available counter space but also how much space you need for your everyday items. A larger tray will accommodate more items, while a smaller one will suit a minimalist approach. Measure the space where you plan to place the tray to determine the size that is most appropriate for your bathroom.

### Style

Black vanity trays come in a variety of styles, from simple and minimalist to ornate and elaborate. Consider the design of your bathroom and whether a more elaborate tray or a simpler, sleeker design would be more appropriate. If your bathroom has a country or vintage theme, opt for a tray with a classic or rustic design. For a more modern bathroom, a sleek and minimalist design would be more fitting. 


### Shape

Black vanity trays come in various shapes, including rectangular, oval, and round. The shape you choose will depend on the space you have available and the items you plan to store on the tray.
