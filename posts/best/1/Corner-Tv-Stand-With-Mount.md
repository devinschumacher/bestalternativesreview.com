### [Furniture of America Astro Wood Corner TV Stand](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Corner+Tv+Stand+With+Mount?utm\_term=furniture-of-america-astro-wood-corner-tv-stand)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Corner+Tv+Stand+With+Mount?utm_term=furniture-of-america-astro-wood-corner-tv-stand"><img alt="furniture-of-america-astro-wood-42-corner-floating-tv-stand-in-cappuccino-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/furniture-of-america-astro-wood-42-corner-floating-tv-stand-in-cappuccino-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently decided to jazz up my living room with a stylish TV stand and came across this Furniture of America Astro Wood 42" Corner Floating TV Stand in Cappuccino. It offers a modern, space-saving solution for my tight corner and a TV stand that's easy to mount on the wall. 

Crafted with a combination of MDF and veneers, it has a contemporary, sleek look to it. The wall-mounted style provides a clean and uncluttered appearance that would complement any living room decor. The mount also makes it an easy task to install and it comes with clear, user-friendly assembly instructions. 

The design features a convenient cable management system. It has a cut-out hole in the back panel for you to hide those unsightly cables. The unit's dimension, 7.5 inches in height, 46.5 inches wide, and 15.5 inches deep, makes it ideal for holding a 46-inch flat-screen TV. 

A major highlight for me is the three open cubbies that not only house my TV but also provide added bonus storage and display space. The fact that it can hold a TV up to 50 inches in size is a big plus, considering the current trend of larger TVs. And the best part is, it doesn't break the bank. 

However, I must mention that after assembly, I found a few wood chips around the stand. It's minor, but could have been avoided with a proper cleaning post-assembly. Additionally, I must highlight that customer service is not as responsive as one would hope, which is a letdown, especially considering the price tag. 

Overall, for someone in the market for a stylish TV stand offering efficient use of wall space and additional storage, this Furniture of America Astro Wood 42" Corner Floating TV Stand in Cappuccino is worth a shot. Just make sure to be patient with the customer service. 


### [Solid Wood Corner TV Stand with Adjustable Mount](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Corner+Tv+Stand+With+Mount?utm\_term=solid-wood-corner-tv-stand-with-adjustable-mount)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Corner+Tv+Stand+With+Mount?utm_term=solid-wood-corner-tv-stand-with-adjustable-mount"><img alt="boltongate-solid-wood-corner-tv-stand-for-tvs-up-to-40-rosalind-wheeler-color-dark-blue-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/boltongate-solid-wood-corner-tv-stand-for-tvs-up-to-40-rosalind-wheeler-color-dark-blue-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've had the pleasure of using the Boltongate Solid Wood Corner TV Stand in my home for a couple of months now, and I must say, it's made a significant difference in the way our television setup looks. The stand itself is sturdy and well-built, with a dark blue hue that adds a touch of class to any living space. 

One of the standout features of this corner TV stand is the raised panel doors that provide an extra layer of protection for your TV. They're designed to keep the elements at bay, which is especially important if you live in an area with harsh weather conditions. Moreover, the arched base is both a stylish and functional addition, providing stability to the unit. 

However, there are a few aspects that could use some improvement. For instance, the entertainment unit is quite tall, which means it might not be the best fit for smaller spaces or if you're looking for something more compact. Additionally, the assembly process can be a bit challenging, particularly if you're not the handiest person around. It might take a bit longer than expected to put everything together. 

All in all, though, I'm quite happy with the Boltongate Solid Wood Corner TV Stand. It's a reliable and stylish option for anyone looking to elevate their TV setup. Despite the minor drawbacks, the pros certainly outweigh the cons, making it a worthwhile investment for anyone in the market for a new TV stand.

However, I must say that the mounting process was a bit of a challenge. The included instructions were rather unhelpful and lacked detail. I found it crucial to consult a few online hints before I could tackle the installation by myself. It's definitely a two-person job, especially considering the product's weight. 

[Overall, I'd say this wall mount is an excellent choice if you need to open up space in your living room and wish to mount a TV in the corner.](https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativereviews.com/https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativesreview.com/blob/main/posts/best/3/Tv-Wall-Mounts.md) Despite the installation being a bit more complicated than expected, I'm quite pleased with the overall product and its features.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Corner+Tv+Stand+With+Mount?utm_term=sleek-corner-tv-stand-with-swivel-mount-for-large-displays-50-80-inches"><img alt="fitueyes-floor-tv-stand-with-swivel-mount-for-50-80-inch-large-lcd-led-tvs-tall-corner-tv-stands-for-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fitueyes-floor-tv-stand-with-swivel-mount-for-50-80-inch-large-lcd-led-tvs-tall-corner-tv-stands-for-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

My spacious living room needed a statement piece that wouldn't take up too much room, and this corner TV stand seemed like the perfect solution. Little did I know, the ease of assembly and versatility would make my life so much easier. 

Upon reaching the product, I was surprised by the weight and sturdiness. The stand supports TVs between 50 to 80 inches, and it took me only a few minutes to put it together using the provided assembly manual. The stand also features two shelves made of MDF and black tempered glass, providing ample storage space for my DVDs, sound systems, and other components. 

Placing my TV on the swivel mount allowed me to have the perfect view and the 30-degree tilting feature proved to be beneficial when guests visit. The minimalist design of the product has become a statement piece in my living room and the small space size has proven to be ideal. 

One negative aspect is that the channel to hide wires is quite narrow, making it challenging to conceal all cords. However, despite this minor flaw, the Fitueyes Floor TV Stand has exceeded my expectations in terms of ease of use, versatility, and visual appeal. It's a sturdy and elegant option that has become an integral part of my modern living space.

Last weekend, I decided it was time to upgrade my TV stand. I needed something that would look great in my living room but also serve as a functional addition to my entertainment space. That's when I stumbled upon this beautiful Furinno Jensen Corner TV Stand with Fireplace. 

First impression? It was a must-have! The wood material with the simple yet modern styling just fit perfectly into the corner of my living room. It also supported my TV quite well, which was an added bonus. 

But wait, there's more! This stand came with an electric fireplace insert. Now, I've had my fair share of stands with fireplaces, and I must say, the heating feature was surprisingly functional. However, it would benefit from a remote control. The flame could be switched on with or without the heat, but there was no mechanism to change the intensity or temperature. 

Assembly was a breeze, thanks to the instruction and hardware pack that came with it. It took me a few hours to finish, but it was well worth the time. The only hiccup was when I had trouble with a few stripping screws, but luckily, there were extras provided. 

The only drawback I found in this product was the construction. The stand felt somewhat flimsy, and I wish it was a bit taller. Overall, though, this was a fantastic find, especially considering the price difference from other retailers. I'd definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a sleek and stylish TV stand with a built-in fireplace.
