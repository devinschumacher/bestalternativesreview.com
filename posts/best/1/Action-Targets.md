The Action Target Ice Qt Target is the 2009 version of ICE's Immigration and Customs Enforcement full-sized target. It's designed to look like a man holding a gun, with printed scoring rings for a realistic and engaging experience. I personally found it interesting, as it promotes shooting at the chest area instead of lower down. 

Plus, it's budget-friendly, making it a great value for the hours of practice you'll get from it. However, be aware that it only features one figure and no other lines to separate upper and lower body.

The targets are impressively accurate and detailed, which was great for honing my target acquisition skills. However, there was one major issue - the paper is way too dark, making it difficult for me to see my shots. 

While the overall design is impressive, I can't overlook this issue and it holds me back from giving these targets a wholehearted recommendation.

### [Cabela's Rimfire Dueling Target for Shooting Practice](https://serp.ly/amazon/Action+Targets?utm\_term=cabelas-rimfire-dueling-target-for-shooting-practice)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Action+Targets?utm_term=cabelas-rimfire-dueling-target-for-shooting-practice"><img alt="cabelas-rimfire-dueling-tree-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cabelas-rimfire-dueling-tree-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

During my recent visit to the shooting range, I decided to give the Cabela's Rimfire Dueling Tree a try. I was immediately drawn to its unique design and the challenge it presented for me and my fellow shooting enthusiasts. The 8 spring-loaded targets flipping for that exhilarating "ding" sound added a whole new level of fun to our session. 

One of the aspects that made the Rimfire Dueling Tree stand out was its versatility in terms of the target sizes available. I really appreciated being able to choose from diameters of 1.5", 2", 2.5", and 3", as it allowed us to tailor our experience to our skill levels. However, I did notice that the plastic covers protecting the spring mechanisms seemed a bit flimsy, and they occasionally got damaged during our sessions. 

Another feature that I found quite useful was the wide base and stakes included with the tree. It provided stability to the target, allowing us to set it up almost anywhere on the range. While the targets themselves appeared quite sturdy, I noticed that the welds on three of them broke after being hit just a few times with. 22 rimfire bullets. This was quite disappointing, as I had expected a more durable build considering the affordable price point. 

All in all, the Cabela's Rimfire Dueling Tree did provide a fun and challenging shooting experience for me and my friends. However, its durability concerns left me a little unsatisfied, as the product felt a bit pricey for its current build quality. If some improvements could be made to reinforce the welds and protect the spring mechanisms, I believe this target would be a fantastic addition to any shooting range.

The ease in transportation and setup was greatly appreciated. And the best part? It's super easy to use with your range equipment. 

However, there's one thing to note: the packaging is quite minimal. It would have been helpful if they included better instructional material with it. That said, once you get the hang of it, the Target B29 becomes a trusty companion for any target shooting enthusiast. 

All in all, the Action Target B29 in black is a fantastic addition to any target shooting range, offering a bit more difficulty at a smaller size. With its durable construction and lighter weight design, you'll wonder why you ever used anything else.
