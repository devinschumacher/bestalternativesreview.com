When it comes to purchasing boat trailer fenders, the material they are made of is a vital factor to consider. The three most prevalent materials are rubber, foam, and plastic.

Foam fenders offer excellent protection and are often more affordable than rubber ones, however, they tend to wear out more rapidly. Plastic fenders are lightweight and economical, but they may not possess the same durability as rubber or foam fenders. 


### Design

The design of boat trailer fenders is another crucial factor to consider. It is essential to find models that provide a secure fit on your boat and trailer, as well as ones that can withstand the force of traveling at high speeds.

If the fenders are still structurally sound, you can repair the damage by sanding down the affected area and applying a high-quality marine-grade sealant or adhesive. For extensive decay or unrepairable damage, replacement of the fenders is necessary. Measure the trailer's arms and repeat the selection process to ensure a proper fit for your new fenders.
