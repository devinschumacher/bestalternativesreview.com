When it comes to purchasing boat trailer fenders, the material they are made of is a vital factor to consider. The three most prevalent materials are rubber, foam, and plastic.

Foam fenders offer excellent protection and are often more affordable than rubber ones, however, they tend to wear out more rapidly. Plastic fenders are lightweight and economical, but they may not possess the same durability as rubber or foam fenders. 


### Design

The design of boat trailer fenders is another crucial factor to consider. It is essential to find models that provide a secure fit on your boat and trailer, as well as ones that can withstand the force of traveling at high speeds. Additionally, some fenders come with adjustable mounting brackets, allowing you to customize the fit and height according to your unique needs. For curved or angled hulls, this feature can prove particularly advantageous.

Some foam fenders are watertight, making them ideal for marine environments. 


### How can I measure my boat trailer for fenders?

To get an accurate measurement for your boat trailer fenders, you need to determine the length, height, and curved shape of the trailer arms. This can be achieved by following these simple steps:

If your boat trailer fenders get damaged, inspect them for any signs of wear or punctures. If the fenders are still structurally sound, you can repair the damage by sanding down the affected area and applying a high-quality marine-grade sealant or adhesive. For extensive decay or unrepairable damage, replacement of the fenders is necessary. Measure the trailer's arms and repeat the selection process to ensure a proper fit for your new fenders. Maintain the fenders in good condition by regularly inspecting them for wear or damage during transportation.
