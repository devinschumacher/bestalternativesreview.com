Just a quick twist when needed, then it locks into place. And don't forget about the Axcel AV-41 scope that comes with it! It's a top-notch addition to this already impressive setup. 

Now, let's talk about weight. At just 1.1 lb, it's not going to weigh you down. And let's not forget that it's designed to work perfectly with a suppressor. So, whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting out, this Accutouch Carbon Pro Sight has got you covered. Highly recommended!
