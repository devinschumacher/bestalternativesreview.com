I recently tried out the Cuisinart Round Belgian Waffle Maker, and let me tell you, it did not disappoint. This waffle maker is incredibly easy to use and creates perfect, thick Belgian waffles that are crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside.

One feature that stood out to me was the built-in LED light, which indicates when the unit is ready for batter and when the waffle is done. It's a game-changer when it comes to ensuring your waffles turn out just right every time. 

However, there were a couple of downsides. Firstly, the waffle grids were difficult to clean thoroughly, especially around the edges.

My favorite feature, though, is that the product stores upright, saving precious counter space. 

While the waffle iron makes crispy waffles, I also found that it was a bit tricky to clean initially. Sometimes, the batter would stick to the non-stick cook plate more stubbornly than I'd like. However, this issue was resolved with a bit of persistence and consistency in my cleaning routine. 

Recently, I tried making savory waffles - cheesy egg biscuits - and the result was impressive.

Plus, the non-stick baking plates were a lifesaver, making clean-up a breeze. 

I must admit, it took me a few tries to figure out the best way to add my favorite mix-ins, but once I got the hang of it, I was able to create some delicious, custom waffles. The locking handles make the process even more convenient, as I could easily switch between vertical and horizontal cooking without any fuss. 

Unfortunately, there were a couple of downsides, too. First, the size of the waffles was not exactly what I was expecting. It only bakes one large Belgian-style waffle, so it's not great for serving a large group. Second, the temperature control seemed a bit unpredictable, which meant I had to fiddle with it a bit to get the perfect browning on the waffles. 

Overall, the Cuisinart Convertible Belgian Waffle Maker VWM-800 definitely has its pros and cons, but if you're a fan of homemade waffles and are looking for a fun, innovative way to make them, it could be worth giving it a try.

Cleaning your waffle maker is essential for maintaining its performance and lifespan. After each use, let any residual batter cool down and then remove it with a spatula. For a deep clean, use a mixture of warm water and dish soap, and disassemble any removable parts for thorough scrubbing. Avoid using abrasive materials, as they can damage the non-stick finish.
