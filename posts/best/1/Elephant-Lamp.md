### [Safavieh Ellie Blue Elephant Lamp](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Elephant+Lamp?utm\_term=safavieh-ellie-blue-elephant-lamp)

The lamp had a charming, elephant-themed design; the blue ceramic finish accentuated its darling details. I found myself eager to plug in the lamp and bask in its warm glow. The lamp was compact and not too heavy, so it was relatively safe for my child in his nursery. 

When my baby finally stepped into his new room, complete with our latest addition, he couldn't contain his excitement. "Look at the big, lovable elephant, " he exclaimed, pointing at the lamp. We turned it on together, and it created a warm, inviting ambiance in his little sanctuary. I loved the fact that the LED bulb not only made the lamp efficient, but it also added convenience to our lives. 

Despite being impressed with the product, there was a small flaw I discovered after a while. The switch, located under the shade of the lamp, was somewhat hard to reach. It required a bit of an awkward maneuver to switch the light on or off, which occasionally left my little one's hands covered in dust that accumulated at the base of the lamp. 

To overcome this issue, I replaced the switch with a push button from another product. This simple modification solved the problem and ensured my baby could turn the lamp on and off effortlessly. All in all, I was thrilled with the purchase and highly recommend this cute little elephant lamp to anyone looking to light up a child's room.

This lamp not only adds a warm glow to the room but also matches the Urban Jungle Collection theme from Lambs & Ivy. The construction is sturdy, with a high gloss paint finish that gives the elephants a shiny appearance. The tapered lamp shade with the charming zig-zag pattern is a lovely touch.
