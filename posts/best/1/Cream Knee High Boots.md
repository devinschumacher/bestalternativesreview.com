### [Journee Collection Extra Wide Calf Boot in Cream, Size 11](https://serp.ly/amazon/Cream+Knee+High+Boots?utm\_term=journee-collection-extra-wide-calf-boot-in-cream-size-11)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Cream+Knee+High+Boots?utm_term=journee-collection-extra-wide-calf-boot-in-cream-size-11"><img alt="journee-collection-wide-width-rhianah-extra-wide-calf-boot-womens-ivory-size-11-boots-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/journee-collection-wide-width-rhianah-extra-wide-calf-boot-womens-ivory-size-11-boots-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Rhianah boot by Journee Collection quickly became a staple in my wardrobe. As someone with wide calves, finding comfortable and fashionable boots can be a challenge, but Rhianah exceeded my expectations. 

The extra-wide calf and wide-width footbed of the Rhianah boot provided a perfect fit, ensuring that I felt cozy and supported all day long. The combination of the 1 1/2-inch block heel and 4 mm Tru Comfort Foam insole made for an incredibly comfortable step. 

The vegan leather material and square toe design added an elegant touch to the boot, while the buckle detail and center seam provided a fashionable accent. The inside zip and strap also made it easy to slip on and off, making the Rhianah boot a practical choice for various occasions. 

However, a minor drawback was that the heel seemed to be susceptible to wear and tear. After some use, the heel started to separate from the boot, which was quite disappointing. Despite this issue, the Rhianah boot's combination of comfort, style, and fit made it a go-to for various outfits in my wardrobe. 


### [Steve Madden Ally Knee High Cream Leather Boots](https://serp.ly/amazon/Cream+Knee+High+Boots?utm\_term=steve-madden-ally-knee-high-cream-leather-boots)

I've been wearing these Steve Madden Ally Cap Toe Knee High Boots in Bone Leather for quite some time now, and I must say, they've become a staple in my wardrobe. The chic and classy design with shining grid detailing caught my eye when I first laid eyes on them, and the knee-length silhouette has been a great addition to my outfits. I especially love the half zipper closure at the side, which makes it easy to slip in and out of. 

One noticeable feature of these boots is their 4-inch heel height, which provides a bit of a boost and adds a touch of elegance to my overall look. However, I did find that the fit was a bit snug initially, but after wearing them around the house for a few hours, they stretched a little and now fit perfectly. 

Overall, I'm quite happy with these boots. They're comfortable, chic, and a great addition to my wardrobe. Just be sure to order the right size to ensure a comfortable fit.

### [Coconut Cream Glazed Croco Over-The-Knee Dress Boots](https://serp.ly/amazon/Cream+Knee+High+Boots?utm\_term=coconut-cream-glazed-croco-over-the-knee-dress-boots)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Cream+Knee+High+Boots?utm_term=coconut-cream-glazed-croco-over-the-knee-dress-boots"><img alt="vince-camuto-womens-minnada-over-the-knee-dress-boots-coconut-cream-glazed-croco-size-5-5m-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vince-camuto-womens-minnada-over-the-knee-dress-boots-coconut-cream-glazed-croco-size-5-5m-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

One of the best aspects of the Minnada boots was their versatility. I could easily dress them up or down, depending on the occasion. I also appreciated how the boots hugged my legs and stayed in place without requiring any additional support. 

However, I noticed that the boot shafts were not very stretchy, which might cause a snug fit for those with larger calves. Additionally, the sizing seemed to be a bit small, so I would recommend going up half a size for a better fit. 

Overall, I had a great experience with the Vince Camuto Women's Minnada Over-The-Knee Dress Boots. Their luxurious finish, comfortable fit, and versatile design make them a worthy addition to any fashionista's wardrobe.

### [Journee Collection Extra Wide Calf Cream Boots for Women (Size 11)](https://serp.ly/amazon/Cream+Knee+High+Boots?utm\_term=journee-collection-extra-wide-calf-cream-boots-for-women-size-11)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Cream+Knee+High+Boots?utm_term=journee-collection-extra-wide-calf-cream-boots-for-women-size-11"><img alt="journee-collection-wide-width-ameylia-extra-wide-calf-boot-womens-bone-size-11-boots-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/journee-collection-wide-width-ameylia-extra-wide-calf-boot-womens-bone-size-11-boots-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who often struggles to find comfortable and stylish boots that fit my wide calf, I was excited to try the Journee Collection Ameylia extra-wide calf boot. Upon receiving them, I was immediately impressed by their chic design, complete with a pointed-toe and eye-catching center seam detail. Slipping my foot into the boot, I appreciated the thoughtfulness of the wide-width footbed, offering a comfortable fit from heel to toe. 

However, one downside I encountered was the somewhat bulky style of the boot, which made it a bit difficult to fit under jeans and skirts. Another aspect I would have preferred was a slightly lower block heel â€“ while it didn't hinder my ability to walk comfortably, it felt a bit high for my taste. 

While I experienced both pros and cons in my journey with the Ameylia boots, I ultimately found them to be a worthwhile investment for their comfort and unique design. Though there were a few adjustments I'd have liked to see, the overall experience was a positive one, and I believe these boots would be a great addition to any wardrobe due to the wide calf option.

These Steven by Steve Madden Calda Knee-High Boots have been a game-changer in my everyday fashion routine. They perfectly complement my outfits with their statement-making design, made from bone faux leather with tonal hardware that adds a touch of elegance. The smooth man-made sole, although not real leather, makes for comfortable walking, and the lightly padded insole ensures a cushioned wear all day. 

However, I should mention that there's a bit of room for improvement. I found the boots to be a bit too small for my taste, which was slightly disappointing given the brand's reputation. Additionally, I would recommend purchasing these with a slightly thicker sock to make them more comfortable right out of the box. Overall, the boots are durable, fashionable, and worth considering for a staple piece in your wardrobe, but always be mindful of sizing when making your purchase.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Cream+Knee+High+Boots?utm_term=alohas-east-off-white-cream-leather-high-boots-for-day-to-night"><img alt="alohas-east-boots-white-eu-36" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alohas-east-boots-white-eu-36/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

However, as much as I loved the look and comfort of the boots, I did encounter a tiny issue with the sizing. I usually wear a size 10, but a size 35 fit me perfectly. But the boots felt a bit snug with thick socks, so I'd recommend going for a size that provides optimal comfort with thin socks. 

Overall, I'm thoroughly satisfied with the Alohas East Boots. They're the perfect addition to any day-to-night outfit and make a statement wherever you go. If you're in the market for a versatile and stylish pair of high boots, look no further than these beauties!
