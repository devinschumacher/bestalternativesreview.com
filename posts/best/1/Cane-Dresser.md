With its classic design and warm walnut finish, it brings a touch of style to your space.

However, assembly can be quite the challenge and requires patience. The pieces are not labeled, and there may be some disassembly needed to align everything correctly. The synthetic rattan drawer faces contribute to the dresser's retro charm, but their alignment can also be difficult to achieve. 

Another aspect to consider is the materials used.

Additionally, the strong chemical smell can be off-putting and take time to dissipate. 

Despite these drawbacks, the Baxton Studio Barrett Mid-Century Modern Walnut Brown Finished Wood and Synthetic Rattan 6-Drawer Dresser is an affordable and stylish option for any bedroom. Just be prepared for the assembly process and to address any potential material issues.
