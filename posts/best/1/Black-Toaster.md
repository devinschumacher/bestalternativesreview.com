### [KitchenAid Sleek Black 4-Slice Toaster](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Black+Toaster?utm\_term=kitchenaid-sleek-black-4-slice-toaster)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Black+Toaster?utm_term=kitchenaid-sleek-black-4-slice-toaster"><img alt="kitchenaid-4-slice-toaster-onyx-black-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/kitchenaid-4-slice-toaster-onyx-black-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the KitchenAid 4-Slice Toaster (Onyx Black) and I must say, it's a game-changer in my kitchen. The first thing that stood out to me was the sleek black finish. It really ties in with the rest of my appliances and makes for a stylish addition to my countertop. But, of course, appearance isn't everything. 

One feature that I absolutely love is the four extra-wide slots. With two kids in the house, we go through a lot of toast. This toaster can easily handle bagels, English muffins, and even wider artisan breads. It's so nice to not have to constantly make adjustments. Plus, the all-metal construction just feels sturdy, like it can withstand daily use without breaking down. 

However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. There are a couple things that could be improved. Firstly, the bagel button doesn't seem to work as well as I would have liked. My bagels often pop out half-toasted. And while I appreciate the high lift lever, it can sometimes be a little too eager to let go of the toast, causing it to slide right out of the slot. 

Another quirk I've noticed is the noise. The toaster makes a pretty loud beep at the end of each cycle. It's nothing terrible, but in a household with light sleepers, it might be a bit of an issue. 

Overall, the KitchenAid 4-Slice Toaster (Onyx Black) has been a reliable and functional addition to my kitchen. It's not without its flaws, but it does its job well enough that I'm willing to overlook them. 


### [Compact Black Stainless Steel 2-Slice Toaster with 6 Shade Control and Gluten-Free Mode](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Black+Toaster?utm\_term=compact-black-stainless-steel-2-slice-toaster-with-6-shade-control-and-gluten-free-mode)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Black+Toaster?utm_term=compact-black-stainless-steel-2-slice-toaster-with-6-shade-control-and-gluten-free-mode"><img alt="crux-2-slice-toaster-with-6-setting-shade-control-black-stainless-steel-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crux-2-slice-toaster-with-6-setting-shade-control-black-stainless-steel-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

With a reasonable price and excellent performance, the Crux 2-Slice Toaster is worth considering as a reliable and stylish addition to your kitchen. 


### [Black + Decker 2-Slice Toaster with Extra-Wide Slots and 7 Toast Shades](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Black+Toaster?utm\_term=black-decker-2-slice-toaster-with-extra-wide-slots-and-7-toast-shades)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Black+Toaster?utm_term=black-decker-2-slice-toaster-with-extra-wide-slots-and-7-toast-shades"><img alt="blackdecker-tr1278bd-2-slice-toaster-black-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackdecker-tr1278bd-2-slice-toaster-black-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had a chance to try out the Black+Decker TR1278BD 2-Slice Toaster, and boy, it sure has made my mornings more convenient! The first thing that caught my attention was the special functions for bagels and frozen items. As someone who enjoys a warm bagel with their coffee, I was delighted to find that this toaster does an excellent job in toasting every bite of my bagel to perfection. 

One of the main highlights for me was the extra-wide slots which allowed me to toast thick slices of bread or even bagels without any hassle. The self-adjusting guides also made it easier to ensure that my toast turned out perfectly each time, and the extra lift lever kept my toast safely within reach. So far, so good. 

However, there were a few things I noticed that could be improved. The manual instructed me to press the bagel button for only the middle elements to be toasted, but I found that it indeed toasted the entire bagel. It would be great to have a separate function for just the cut side of the bagel. 

Another minor issue, I encountered was the toaster's unreliability. There were instances where the setting didn't stick, and the toast would come out either too cold or too hot. Although it's not a dealbreaker, it would be nice to have a more consistent performance. 

All in all, the Black+Decker TR1278BD 2-Slice Toaster is a great option for those who enjoy toasting a quick breakfast, especially if you're a fan of bagels or thick bread slices. Despite the occasional unreliability, it's performed fairly well in my daily routine, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable toaster option.

And you know what I love even more? The pop-up function – oh, that lift! It takes all the guesswork out of knowing when your bread is done, making toasty mornings a breeze.

### [Mid-Century Modern Retro 2-Slice Toaster - Black](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Black+Toaster?utm\_term=mid-century-modern-retro-2-slice-toaster-black)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Black+Toaster?utm_term=mid-century-modern-retro-2-slice-toaster-black"><img alt="swan-2-slice-retro-toaster-black-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/swan-2-slice-retro-toaster-black-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Swan 2-Slice Retro Toaster in black, and let me tell you, it's a real winner when it comes to adding a vintage vibe to your kitchen design. The first thing I noticed was the chic, mid-century modern lines – a definite style upgrade from my old toaster. 

One of the key features that stood out to me was the adjustable browning control. The six levels of browning are easy to set, thanks to the sleek adjustable knob. I also appreciated how auto-centering ensured even toasting every time – no more uneven slices! 

Now, onto the not-so-great part. The push knob, while transparent and adding to the aesthetic, felt a bit flimsy in my hands. Plus, there's that plastic lever issue some users have been experiencing – not exactly a feature you want to see break on your brand-new toaster. 

Another tiny drawback is the size of the slots. If you're working with larger slices of bread, you might find yourself trimming them down to fit. And, speaking of trimming, some users have mentioned difficulties with cleaning the crumb tray. It's not a major issue, but it's something to keep in mind. 

Despite these minor setbacks, the Swan 2-Slice Retro Toaster has definitely been a game-changer in my kitchen. The stylish design, coupled with its functional features, makes it a top contender for anyone looking to add a touch of retro elegance to their kitchen appliances.

The extra-lift carriage lever has made removing toast a breeze without having to worry about any singed fingers. 

Cord storage is also a thoughtful feature, keeping my kitchen counter looking tidy. I must say I appreciate the instruction booklet included as it came in handy at first use. However, I noticed that the exterior can get quite hot during extended use, which I had to be mindful of to avoid any accidental burns. 

Overall, the Cuisinart's 4-Slice Metal Classic Toaster (Black Stainless) has been a reliable and functional appliance in my daily life. The combination of style and practicality makes it a worthy investment.

Overall, the Cuisinart 4 Slice Touchscreen Toaster is a reliable and user-friendly addition to my kitchen. The touchscreen interface and QuickView feature make my mornings a little easier, but I do wish the removable crumb tray and size were a bit more convenient.

[I've had quite a few toaster ovens in the past, and this one stands out for its simplicity and ease-of-use.](https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativereviews.com/blob/main/posts/best/3/Restaurant-Toaster.md) The moment you plug it in, it's ready to go – no fancy settings or complicated menus to navigate. Plus, I love that the toaster fits perfectly on my countertop without taking up too much space. 

One of the aspects that really caught my attention is the extra-wide design of the toaster. It can fit a whole 13x9 pan, which is fantastic when you're baking large items like lasagna or even a 12-inch frozen pizza. The multiple functions, like convection bake and broil, provide a lot of versatility. The 60-minute timer and stay-on feature are great, allowing you to keep an eye on your food without having to constantly check the progress. 

However, there were a couple of drawbacks I encountered. First, the toaster is quite bulky, and I had to make sure I had enough counter space for it. I also noticed that the toaster dial doesn't work for regular baking, only for toasting. It's a bit inconvenient, but I managed to work around it. 

Overall, I'm quite satisfied with the Black Decker Toaster. It's straightforward, easy to use, and the extra-wide design is a game-changer for large baking tasks. Just make sure you have enough space for it and prepare for a noisy toasting experience.
