### [Concealment Express Adjustable IWB Kydex Holster for Beretta APX](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Concealment+Express+Holsters?utm\_term=concealment-express-adjustable-iwb-kydex-holster-for-beretta-apx)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Concealment+Express+Holsters?utm_term=concealment-express-adjustable-iwb-kydex-holster-for-beretta-apx"><img alt="concealment-express-iwb-kydex-holster-fits-beretta-apx-right-black-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/concealment-express-iwb-kydex-holster-fits-beretta-apx-right-black-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Last week, I decided to give the Concealment Express [IWB Kydex Holster](https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativesreview.com/blob/main/posts/best/2/Iwb-Kydex-Holster.md) a try. This holster promises to offer a comfortable fit, easy concealability, and adjustable retention. 

Upon receiving the holster, I was impressed by the quality craftsmanship and the precise way it was molded to fit the Beretta APX. With a simple adjustment of the retention, I was able to ensure my firearm stayed securely in place, regardless of my movement. 

One of the things that I appreciated most about this holster was its lightweight nature, thanks to its Kydex material. This material also prevented moisture from harming my firearm and provided an extra layer of durability. 

However, there was one drawback to this holster - the belt clip seemed a bit bulky to me. When I wore a t-shirt or tucked in a button-up shirt, the clip would sometimes print through the fabric, making it harder to hide. 

In conclusion, I am overall pleased with the Concealment Express IWB Kydex Holster and its performance in maintaining a comfortable and secure fit for my Beretta APX. While there is a slight aesthetic concern related to the belt clip, the pros outweigh the cons, making this an excellent choice for daily carry. 


### [Concealment Express IWB Kydex Plus Line Holster for Optic Ready Glock Pistols](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Concealment+Express+Holsters?utm\_term=concealment-express-iwb-kydex-plus-line-holster-for-optic-ready-glock-pistols)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Concealment+Express+Holsters?utm_term=concealment-express-iwb-kydex-plus-line-holster-for-optic-ready-glock-pistols"><img alt="rounded-by-concealment-express-iwb-kydex-plus-line-holster-for-optic-ready-w-claw-monoblock-clip-glo-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rounded-by-concealment-express-iwb-kydex-plus-line-holster-for-optic-ready-w-claw-monoblock-clip-glo-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to use the Concealment Express Kydex Plus Line Holster. This holster is designed for inside the waistband (IWB) carry and is specifically crafted for Glock 19, 19X, 23, 32, and 45 Gen 1-5 pistols. I was impressed by its slim design and lightweight feel, making it a great option for everyday carry. 

One of the standout features of this holster is the combination of a claw and a monoblock clip for added concealment. I found that it efficiently tucked my Glock 19 into my pants without noticeable bulging. Additionally, the monoblock clip provided a secure grip, preventing the holster from moving out of place. 

However, there was a small hiccup with the holster I received. I noticed that it did not come with the promised monoblock clip, but instead, it had two thin metal clips. While this didn't affect the holster's functionality, I was a bit surprised by the discrepancy between the advertised and received product. 

But overall, I'm a fan of this Kydex Plus Line Holster. It's comfortable, easy to use, and does a great job of hiding my pistol without being too constrictive. If you're looking for a reliable IWB option for your Glock, this might just be the one.

As someone who's used a Concealment Express IWB Kydex Holster for my Glock 34, I can say that this holster really makes a difference. The user-adjustable cant from -5 to +20 degrees allows me to customize the fit and carry, while the posi-click retention provides a secure hold. The minimalist inside the waistband design is perfect for everyday concealed carry, and the 1.5" fiber reinforced stealth belt clip keeps things snug and secure. 

However, one thing I noticed is that the claw kit can be a little tricky to set up. But once it's in place, it really helps push the handle of the gun back, making it more comfortable to wear. Overall, I'm really happy with this holster. It's lightweight, durable, and comfortable enough for everyday use. And with the lifetime warranty, I have peace of mind that it's made to last. It's a great choice for anyone looking for a reliable, comfortable, and discreet way to carry their Glock 34.

I recently tried out the Concealment Express OWB Kydex Belt Loop Holster for The S&W M&P 4.25" 9/40 and I was pleasantly surprised by its sleek and comfortable design. One of the great features of this holster is that it's compatible with slide-mounted optics, making it an ideal choice for those who prefer their firearm with mounted optics like MOS, RMR, or red dot sights. 

The holster feels very lightweight, which is a crucial aspect when you're carrying it around on a daily basis. I appreciate that it holds my weapon securely while still being minimal and compact. Its precision-molded construction ensures that the holster fits my specific firearm perfectly, providing a smooth and natural draw every time. 

However, there were some areas where the holster could use improvement. While the fit is impressive, I found that the holster can sometimes pull the gun away from my body, which can be a bit uncomfortable during daily wear. This was especially noticeable when I wore the holster for extended periods of time. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend the Concealment Express OWB Kydex Belt Loop Holster for those in search of a reliable, minimalistic, and comfortable outside the waistband holster. Just make sure to keep its limitations in mind for optimal concealment and comfort.

Concealment Express Holster Belt Clip

I've been using the Concealment Express Holster Belt Clip for a while now, and I must say, it's pretty impressive. The materials used to make this little piece are on point; it's sturdy, but not overly rigid. The fiber reinforced nylon blend is a great fit for the job, as it's not too soft and not too hard, making it perfect for daily use. 

One of the things I really appreciate about this belt clip is its versatility. It's compatible with a wide range of holsters and belt sizes. The 1.5 inch clip is a standard replacement for most of their holsters, and if you need something bigger, the 1.75 inch tactical clip is available too. For those who prefer an over-the-waist holster, the 1.5 inch paddle clip is also an excellent option. 

However, using this belt clip has its downsides too. Despite its versatility, there have been times when it didn't work as expected. The hook attachment needs to be longer for improved security, especially when using an extreme cant position. It's also frustrating when the clip isn't the correct size, as happened to a fellow user who was sent a smaller clip than ordered twice. 

Overall, the Concealment Express Holster Belt Clip is a reliable and functional piece of equipment. With a few tweaks and improvements, it could be even better. But for now, it works well, and it's a great choice for anyone looking for a high-quality, versatile belt clip for their holster.

Its ambidextrous design means it is suitable for both left-handed and right-handed users, making it a versatile choice. The Kydex material ensures durability and sturdy construction, which can stand up against frequent use. 

One of the standout features of this product is its adjustable magazine retention. The MRD makes it possible to customize the retention level to match individual preferences.

Moreover, the 1.5-inch belt clip on the mag holster provides convenience and practicality for everyday use. 

Like any product, the Concealment Express MRD Magazine Holster boasts its pros and cons. While its durability, versatility, and adjustability make it a valuable purchase for anyone in need of a magazine holster, it is not without its flaws. Specifically, some users have reported difficulties with its compatibility with specific magazine models or issues with belt clip retention. 

Despite these minor concerns, the Concealment Express Magazine Holster is an attractive option for those seeking a reliable and customizable solution for their magazine carrier needs. Its high rating and large number of positive reviews reflect the value that many customers have found in this product.

The custom fit and design, combined with the hardware options, made it so easy to adjust and adapt. I've been using it for a couple of weeks now, and it's definitely made a difference in the way my holster fits. 

The best part for me? The elimination of printing. Before using this claw kit, I was constantly aware of bulges on my waist. But with this attachment, I could hide my firearm seamlessly - a game-changer for my lifestyle. 

Not everything is perfect, though. The holster claw itself felt a little oversized, and I had to make some adjustments to ensure the optimal fit with my specific firearm. And while I appreciate the variety in hardware that comes with the kit, some of the pieces felt a bit unnecessary. 

Overall, though, I would definitely recommend this claw kit to anyone looking for a more comfortable and discreet solution for their concealed carry holster. It just goes to show that the right tools make all the difference.

Each holster is made with high-quality materials and designed for comfort and concealability. 

Additionally, Concealment Express holsters come in different styles and finishes, such as leather, kydex, and hybrid materials. This allows customers to choose the holster that best fits their style and budget while still providing the security and reliability they need for their firearm. The company also offers customization options, such as color choices or accessory add-ons, to further personalize each holster. 


### What is the return policy for Concealment Express holsters?

### How do I choose the right holster size for my firearm?

Choosing the right holster size for your firearm is crucial to ensure a proper fit and retention. Concealment Express provides a size chart on their website, which includes measurements for popular handgun models. To determine the correct size for your specific firearm, you'll need to know its barrel length and width. These dimensions can usually be found on the manufacturer's specification sheet or on the barrel itself. 

Once you have the barrel length and width, refer to the size chart on the Concealment Express website. This chart lists the corresponding holster size based on the given firearm dimensions. If your firearm does not have a specific barrel length listed, you can choose a holster size that is closest to the measurements of your gun. This may not provide the exact fit you desire, but it will at least offer a good starting point for your choice. Remember, it's always best to consult with a knowledgeable salesperson or customer service representative when selecting a holster for your firearm to ensure the best fit and retention. 


### What materials are used in Concealment Express holsters?

Concealment Express holsters are made using high-quality materials such as leather, kydex, and hybrid materials. Leather holsters are typically preferred for their durability and natural feel, while kydex holsters are favored for their rigidity, which helps maintain the firearm's shape and retention. Hybrid holsters combine the best of both worlds, offering the flexibility and comfort of leather combined with the rigidity of kydex. 

These materials are chosen for their ability to provide a secure and comfortable fit for your firearm, while still maintaining a low profile for concealed carry. Additionally, each material offers its own set of benefits, such as quicker draw times, reduced wear on the firearm's finish, and long-lasting durability. Customers have the option to choose the material that best suits their needs and personal preferences when selecting a Concealment Express holster.

### What is the price range for Concealment Express holsters?

Concealment Express offers a variety of holsters at different price points to accommodate various budgets. While some of their more basic holsters are available for as little as $20, others can be priced significantly higher. Pricing depends on several factors, such as the type of material used, the specific model selected, and any additional customization options that the customer chooses. 

It's essential to consider both the price and the value offered when selecting a holster from Concealment Express or any other brand. While more expensive options may come with increased features or durability, a less expensive holster may still provide the basic functionality needed for a concealed carry solution. Customers should also factor in the potential long-term savings, as a high-quality holster with a longer lifespan may ultimately be more cost-effective than replacing a lower-priced option multiple times. 


### How long does it take for a Concealment Express holster to ship?

Concealment Express typically processes and ships orders within 1-3 business days after receiving them. Shipping times depend on the chosen shipping method, whether it's standard or expedited. Once the order is shipped, customers can expect to receive their holster within 2-5 business days for standard shipping or 1-2 business days for expedited shipping. These shipping times are estimates and may vary slightly based on certain factors, such as holidays or unforeseen circumstances. 

Concealment Express provides customers with tracking information to track their orders and monitor the shipping progress. This transparency allows customers to have peace of mind knowing when their holster will arrive and enables them to make any necessary adjustments if needed. It's always best to check the company's website or contact their customer service team for the most up-to-date information regarding shipping times and any potential delays.
