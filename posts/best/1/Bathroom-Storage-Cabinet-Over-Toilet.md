Additionally, the assembly process can be frustrating and time-consuming, as some reviewers have experienced misaligned pre-drilled holes and confusing instructions.

When I first got the Better Homes & Gardens Harborough Bathroom Space Saver, I was initially hesitant about how sturdy it would be. But once I started assembling it, I was impressed with the ease of which it came together. The assembly instructions were clear and easy to follow, and I only had a few setbacks along the way. 

One of the things that stood out to me about this space saver was its versatility. There were multiple shelves to accommodate a variety of items, perfect for storing toiletries, bath accessories, and more. And the frosted glass doors added an element of privacy and style. But what really set this space saver apart was the latch-style hardware, which ensured that the doors stayed shut when I needed them to. 

Despite the ease of assembly and the functional aspects of the product, I did notice a few drawbacks. The material used for the shelves was a bit flimsy and felt like it might not be able to hold much weight. I also found that the hardware needed to secure the space saver to the wall was a bit difficult to work with. But overall, I was happy with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone in need of a bit more storage in their bathroom.
