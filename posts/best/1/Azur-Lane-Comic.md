### [Limited Edition Azur Lane Vol.6 Comic](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Azur+Lane+Comic?utm\_term=limited-edition-azur-lane-vol-6-comic)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Azur+Lane+Comic?utm_term=limited-edition-azur-lane-vol-6-comic"><img alt="azur-lane-vol-6-limited-edition-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/azur-lane-vol-6-limited-edition-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Ever since I picked up the Azur Lane Vol. 6 Limited Edition, it's been a pleasant addition to my collection. I must say, their attention to detail is impressive. The case feels sturdy, and the design is sleek, which reflects well on Toho Studio's workmanship. 

As a fan of Ishikawa Yui's acting, I was excited to see her performance in this limited edition. Director Tensho managed to keep up with the franchise's charm, keeping me engaged in this 47-minute journey with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio. 

The unrevised and revised version of Volume 2 share the same product number, which you should be aware of if you're planning to purchase it. Aside from that, there wasn't much I found to complain about. The Japanese language option is a plus for anime aficionados, and the 2020 release year adds another element of freshness to the series. 

Overall, this limited edition release met my expectations and more, thanks to the high-quality production from Gamers Ltd. Zenmaki. And even though I haven't wrapped up my viewing yet, I'm excited to continue engaging with the Azur Lane Comic experience. 


### [Azur Lane Comic Anthology Book](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Azur+Lane+Comic?utm\_term=azur-lane-comic-anthology-book)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Azur+Lane+Comic?utm_term=azur-lane-comic-anthology-book"><img alt="------------------book-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/------------------book-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Azur Lane Comic Anthology VOL. 5" is a hefty addition to the Azur Lane series, weighing in at a mighty 400g. Released in November 2018, it features 130 pages of fascinating content exclusive to the Japanese market. 

I took it with me on my daily commute, hoping it would provide a reprieve from the humdrum of my routine. However, the weight became a nuisance, quickly turning it into more of a workout tool than a leisurely read. 

The high-quality images were certainly a definite plus, adding an appealing aesthetic to the pages. However, being limited to the Japanese language has been a drawback for me personally. It would have been great to have an English translation available for a broader audience. 

Despite these minor issues, "Azur Lane Comic Anthology VOL. 5" stands out in the series for its engaging stories and remarkable visuals. It's just a shame you need to know how to read Japanese to fully enjoy them. 


### [Azur Lane Vol.2 Limited Edition Blu-ray](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Azur+Lane+Comic?utm\_term=azur-lane-vol-2-limited-edition-blu-ray)

As an anime fan, the Azur Lane Vol. 2 Blu-ray Limited Edition captures my attention with its exclusive features. The original soundtrack CD is an excellent addition for fans who want to immerse themselves in the show's musical elements. The special 20-page booklet provides a deeper look into the world of Azur Lane, making it a must-read for those who want to learn more about the series. 

The special outer case and digipack specifications showcase the Blu-ray's limited edition status, making it a standout addition to any collection. However, I wish the runtime was longer, as it's slightly on the shorter side. 

Overall, the Azur Lane Vol. 2 Blu-ray Limited Edition is a great purchase for fans looking to expand their collection of limited-edition special editions.
