The metal probe is another feature I really appreciated. It's sharp and durable, which means it can handle a variety of tasks without breaking down or getting damaged. And, when I needed to test some wires in tight spaces, the probe's pointy tip was invaluable. 

However, there were a couple of downsides to using this tester. For one, the red and green LED lights used to indicate positive and negative charges, respectively, were a bit on the dim side. Unfortunately, this made them difficult to read in certain lighting conditions, especially when I was working outside in the bright sun. I'd love to see them incorporated into a larger, more visible design at some point. 

Another minor issue I encountered was when I first started using the tester. It took me a bit to wrap my head around the fact that the red light indicated a positive charge, while the green light meant negative. I found myself accidentally touching live wires a couple of times before I understood which color corresponded to which charge. So, as much as I love the tester, I think it might be helpful to include a quick guide or instructions on how to interpret the LED lights, especially for first-time users. 

All things considered, though, the EverStart 6/12 Volt Circuit Tester has been a godsend for someone like me who's always diving into electrical issues. Its portability, sturdy metal probe, and ability to test for low voltage circuits make it a must-have for anyone whose vehicle or home sees a lot of DIY maintenance.
