### [Conair Styling Essentials Professional Barber Shears](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Barber+Scissors?utm\_term=conair-styling-essentials-professional-barber-shears)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Barber+Scissors?utm_term=conair-styling-essentials-professional-barber-shears"><img alt="conair-styling-essentials-barber-shears-5-1-2-inch-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/conair-styling-essentials-barber-shears-5-1-2-inch-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Recently, I had the chance to use the Conair Styling Essentials Barber Shears, and let me tell you, it was quite the experience. I was using these shears for a haircut and I must say, the sharpness of the blades really stood out. They cut smoothly and evenly, making my haircut look clean and precise. 

However, the durability of the product was a bit of a concern. Despite the sharp blades, I noticed that they started to dull after a few uses. Additionally, the comb included with the set felt a bit cheap and didn't hold up well to thicker hair. It's a shame, as the scissors themselves are quite well made and comfortable to use. 

Overall, I think the Conair Styling Essentials Barber Shears are a solid choice for anyone looking for precision and comfort in their hair cutting experience. Just remember to take care of your shears, as they might not hold up as long as you'd like. 


### [Cricket Route 66 Barber Shear for Precision Haircuts](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Barber+Scissors?utm\_term=cricket-route-66-barber-shear-for-precision-haircuts)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Barber+Scissors?utm_term=cricket-route-66-barber-shear-for-precision-haircuts"><img alt="cricket-route-66-barber-shear-7-6" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cricket-route-66-barber-shear-7-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to give the Route 66 by Cricket 7.5" barber shear a try, and let me tell you, it's quite the unique experience. With a stainless steel material that's resistant to corrosion, I found these shears to be quite sturdy and long-lasting. 

One of the most striking elements of this shear is its beveled edge, which allows for precision and a sharp, clean professional haircut. Its small cutting scissors for kids and even serving as a split-end cutter makes it a versatile tool in my hands. 

However, just like any other shear, it did require some sharpening. Although it can be a bit tedious, once sharpened, it functions exceptionally well. And the added bonus of a removable finger rest makes the entire experience even more comfortable while working. 

In conclusion, the Route 66 by Cricket 7.5" barber shear offers a blend of both traditional artistry and modern precision, making it a solid tool for professionals and beginners alike. Its durability and versatility make it well worth the investment, even for those looking for a haircut at home.

However, I must admit that my experience with the product's packaging wasn't as stellar. The initial package received was a bit sloppy, which could be off-putting for potential buyers who appreciate a premium-looking presentation.

Despite these minor concerns, I think that the ice tempered scissors prove to be a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to style their hair at home or keep their locks in optimal condition between salon visits.

However, there are a few minor downsides. While the scissors come well-sharpened, I would have appreciated a pre-oiled pair to maintain their edge more effectively. Additionally, the product does not come with a case or holder for storage, which could be a convenient addition. 

Overall, though, I am impressed with the performance and quality of these hair cutting scissors. They have made a significant difference in the way I cut hair, and I would definitely recommend them to anyone in the market for a high-quality, professional-grade pair of scissors.

Choosing the best pair of scissors requires an understanding of what features to look for and how they can impact your work. In this buyer's guide, we'll cover the important aspects of barber scissors, helping you make the right decision for your professional needs. 


### Fundamentals of Barber Scissors

There are several factors to consider when purchasing a pair of barber scissors: width, length, handle design, weight, and materials. Let's dive into each factor to help you make a well-informed decision on your next purchase. Width refers to the space between the blades, and this will vary depending on the specific style of scissor. Longitudinal scissors are known for their wider gap, while concaves offer a more closed gap for precision work. The length of the scissor handles will also affect your comfort during use. Longer handles may provide more control, but can be more difficult to store. Handle designs also differ, with some featuring angled or ergonomic grips for added comfort. Lastly, the materials used to make the scissors have an impact on the price point, durability, and maintenance. Stainless steel is a common choice, offering a balance of affordability and performance.

### Ergonomics and Comfort

Comfort is essential for sustained use, and it's crucial to consider the ergonomics of a pair of scissors before making a purchase. Pay attention to the grip, ensuring the handles are comfortable and non-slip. A well-designed grip prevents strain on your hand and joints while keeping the scissors in place during precision work. Some handles may be adjustable to accommodate different hand sizes or preferences. Overall, prioritizing ergonomics will help you perform your best work without discomfort or fatigue. 


### Maintenance and Longevity

Maintaining your scissors is critical for their longevity, safety, and performance. Proper care includes cleaning the scissors after each use, oiling the blades, and storing the scissors in a dry, organized place. For optimal sharpness, it's recommended to sharpen your scissors every 6-12 months. This investment in maintenance will ensure your scissors remain in excellent condition, continue performing well, and ultimately preserve your investment. A good pair of barber scissors should last you a long time; however, choosing the right blade thickness and material combination is also essential for lasting performance.

### Do barber scissors require frequent sharpening, and how can I maintain their sharpness?

Barber scissors, like knives, need regular sharpening to prevent any dullness. Depending on usage, their sharpness may wear down in a matter of weeks to a few months. Sharpening your scissors can protect clients from minor accidents and ensure a cleaner and more efficient cutting process. It also prolongs the life of the scissors and ultimately saves money on costly replacements. 

 To maintain the sharpness of your barber scissors, ensure proper closing after each usage and do not store them with open blades. Clean the scissors regularly with a cloth or tissue during your working day. There are many tools available, such as sharpening stones or specialized sharpening machines, that can help you keep your scissors in pristine condition. Investing in a trusted sharpening instrument will save time and money in the long run. 


### How should I care for and clean my barber scissors?

Cleaning should happen regularly during the working day. After each client, use a cloth or tissue to wipe the blades and body of the scissors. If any hair is caught in the blades, gently remove it without twisting the scissors, as this can damage the blades or loosen the bolts. Some barber scissors come with a protective cap that can be used to secure the blades after each use, which can prevent any dirt or debris from getting inside and save cleaning time. 

 When not in use, store your scissors in a protective case or pouch, and place them in a secure location away from direct sunlight and other external factors that can cause damage over time. Periodically inspect your scissors for any signs of wear and tear, and address any repair needs as necessary to extend the life of your investment.
