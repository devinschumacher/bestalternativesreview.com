### [Panasonic RB-M500B-K: Immersive Bass Wireless Over-Ear Headphones with Closed Back Design](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Closed+Back+Headphones?utm\_term=panasonic-rb-m500b-k-immersive-bass-wireless-over-ear-headphones-with-closed-back-design)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Closed+Back+Headphones?utm_term=panasonic-rb-m500b-k-immersive-bass-wireless-over-ear-headphones-with-closed-back-design"><img alt="panasonic-rb-m500b-k-immersive-bass-wireless-over-ear-headphones-black-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/panasonic-rb-m500b-k-immersive-bass-wireless-over-ear-headphones-black-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've had the Panasonic M500 Deep Bass Wireless Headphones in my possession for the past week, and I must say, they've been a delight to use. The best thing about these headphones is their powerful bass. It's not just a little boom that you might hear from some cheaper headphones, but a deep and satisfying rumble that makes you feel like you're listening to your music on a concert stage. 

One of my favorite features is the Free Edge drive system, which features a highly elastic nanofibre diaphragm that isn't directly attached to the speaker frame. This results in smoother diaphragm movements, which ensure low dynamic and high-resolution sound. And the XBS DEEP extra bass system, along with the Bass Reactor function, works together to create a bass experience that's so realistic, it feels like you're in the middle of a live concert. 

However, there are a few drawbacks to these headphones. The first one is the button placement. It was a bit of a struggle for me to figure out which button was which, and I often unintentionally pressed the wrong button while trying to adjust the volume or skip tracks. Additionally, the headphones themselves are quite large, which might be a bit of an issue for some people, especially those with smaller heads or who don't want to look like they're wearing a pair of oversized hearing aids. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I have to say that the Panasonic M500 Deep Bass Wireless Headphones have been a breath of fresh air. They offer a comfortable fit, excellent sound quality, and a bass experience that's hard to beat. If you're someone who enjoys thumping beats and immersive music, these headphones are definitely worth giving a try.

One of the highlights of my experience with these headphones is their frequency response. With a range of 5Hz-23kHz, they manage to provide an immersive and dynamic listening experience. This really comes to life when connected to portable audio players, offering zero resonance and excellent soundproofing. 

However, there were a few areas where the Focal Elegia could use some improvement. The bass could've used a bit more punch, as it felt light on some songs. Additionally, the midrange could have benefited from a slight boost in presence, as vocals sometimes sounded a bit too far back in the mix. Despite these minor setbacks, I found the headphones to offer an overall enjoyable listening experience. 

In conclusion, the Focal Elegia is a top-tier closed-back headphone that offers a premium build, excellent sound quality, and stunning aesthetics. While there might be a few areas where it could be better, overall it's a great choice for those looking for a polished listening experience.

## Buyer's Guide

Welcome to our exhaustive guide on how to choose the ideal closed back headphones for your needs. We delve into the fundamental aspects, ponderings, and general counsel to aid you in making an educated decision when selecting the perfect pair of closed back headphones for your preferences. 


### What are Closed Back Headphones?

Closed back headphones, also referred to as closed-cup headphones, are a category of headphones that entirely encircle the ear. This design attribute reduces unwanted external noise, often referred to as ambient noise, allowing for a consistent and unaltered sound quality throughout the entire frequency spectrum. These headphones are popular for their compactness, making them an excellent companion for commuting, traveling, or any other mobile listening scenarios.

### Pivotal Features to Take into Account

1. Noise Cancellation: In pursuit of a headphone that effectively cancels out extraneous noise, seek out models with active or passive noise cancellation technologies. These mechanisms suppress unwanted noise, offering a more engaging listening experience. Active noise cancellation operates by employing electronic signals to counteract and counteract ambient noise, while passive noise cancellation depends on the physical properties of the headphone's design to obstruct sound. 


### Considerations for Selecting the Most Suitable Closed Back Headphones

1. Fit and Comfort: Given their direct contact with the ear, fit and comfort are paramount. Opt for lightweight headphones that feature adjustable ear cups or headbands to ensure a snug and comfortable fit. Certain models may even come equipped with memory foam ear pads, offering additional comfort and noise isolation.

### General Advice for Picking the Ultimate Closed Back Headphones

1. Evaluate the Impedance: Impedance denotes the resistance a headphone offers. If you plan on using your closed back headphones with portable electronic devices, look for models with low impedance (typically around 32 ohms or lower). This ensures that your device has the capacity to deliver sufficient power to the headphones, contributing to a superior listening experience.

### What are closed back headphones?

Closed back headphones are a type of headphone that have a solid or closed-off back cup, which fully encloses the earpiece. This design helps to reduce outside noise entering the headphones and prevents sound leakage, making them suitable for both studio and everyday use. The closed-off back also offers better bass response and a more immersive listening experience. However, they may also increase the risk of ear overheating and discomfort during extended periods of wearing. 

Closed back headphones are available in a wide range of price points, with premium options providing enhanced sound quality and comfort. Some notable features of closed back headphones include their exceptional noise-cancelling capabilities and the ability to provide a personalized audio experience for different listeners. However, they may not offer the same level of sound isolation and dynamic range as open back headphones. 


### What is the difference between closed back and open back headphones?

The key difference between closed back and open back headphones lies in their earcup design. Closed back headphones feature a solid or closed-off rear cup that fully encloses the earpiece, while open back headphones have an open earcup design that allows for more sound dispersion into the surrounding environment. This open-back design provides better sound isolation and a more natural sound stage, making them a preferred choice for audiophiles and those who seek a more immersive listening experience. 

However, closed back headphones offer some advantages as well. They minimize sound leakage, making them less noticeable in public settings, and they can provide better bass response due to their ability to fully enclose the earpiece. Additionally, closed back headphones are often more lightweight and comfortable for day-to-day use, as they don't require as robust construction materials as open back headphones. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Closed+Back+Headphones"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Closed-Back-Headphones-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Closed-Back-Headphones-5" height="540"></a></div>


### Are closed back headphones good for listening to music in the studio?

Yes, closed back headphones can be an excellent choice for studio use, particularly for music production and mixing tasks. Their noise-cancelling capabilities and sound isolation make them well-suited for studio environments where precision and accuracy are essential. The solid earcups of closed back headphones also help reduce external noise, making it easier for the listener to accurately hear and judge the music being played. The closed back design also provides a more immersive listening experience, giving producers and audio engineers a more detailed and balanced sound representation. 

Some closed back headphones specifically designed for studio use feature multiple driver configurations or adjustable sound settings, allowing users to fine-tune their listening experience based on individual preferences and requirements. However, it is essential to choose a closed back headphone that offers a frequency response suitable for your intended purpose, as some models may have a narrower frequency range that may not be ideal for all types of music and sound production tasks. 


### What are some key benefits of closed back headphones?

Closed back headphones offer several benefits compared to other types of headphones. Their noise-cancelling capabilities allow users to listen to music without being disturbed by external noise. The closed earcups also help to prevent sound leakage, keeping the audio experience more private for the listener. This makes them ideal for use in public spaces, such as transportation, or in situations where you want to minimize the impact of your audio on others. 

Moreover, closed back headphones tend to be more lightweight and comfortable to wear for extended periods compared to open back headphones, due to their solid earcups and closed-off design. The closed earcups of closed back headphones also provide better bass response, offering a more immersive listening experience with a fuller and more pronounced low-end frequency range.

### Which closed back headphones are best for high-fidelity audio?

When it comes to high-fidelity audio, the choice of closed back headphones can be subjective, as it depends on individual preferences and requirements. Some high-quality closed back headphones with excellent sound quality include: Sennheiser HD 660 S, DT 770 PRO, and Beyerdynamic DT 880 Pro. These headphones are renowned for their accurate frequency response, excellent imaging, and impressive dynamics, making them ideal for high-quality music listening and studio use. 

However, it is crucial to consider factors such as personal budget, build quality, and wearability when selecting a closed back headphone. Some high-end models may have a more expensive price tag but may offer longer-lasting durability and superior comfort that can make the purchase worthwhile in the long run. 


### What is the right frequency response for the best closed back headphones?

The right frequency response for closed back headphones depends on the specific model and personal preferences. However, a well-balanced closed back headphone should have a frequency response that covers a wide range, typically from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. This range ensures that the headphones can accurately reproduce the full spectrum of audio frequencies found in music, movies, and other sound sources. 

While a higher frequency response is generally preferred for the most accurate and dynamic sound quality, it is essential to consider other factors such as the headphone's noise-cancelling capabilities, imaging, and dynamics. Moreover, individual preferences and ear sensitivities may alter the optimal frequency response for some listeners, so it is crucial to listen to various headphones and choose the one that provides the best overall audio experience.
