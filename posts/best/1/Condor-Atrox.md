### [Condor Australian Army Walnut Handle Machete](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Condor+Atrox?utm\_term=condor-australian-army-walnut-handle-machete)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Condor+Atrox?utm_term=condor-australian-army-walnut-handle-machete"><img alt="condor-australian-army-18-25-machete-walnut-handle-sheath-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/condor-australian-army-18-25-machete-walnut-handle-sheath-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Lately, I had the opportunity to test the Condor Australian Army Machete, which features a walnut handle and sheath. This robust tool delivers a powerful blow with its 12.875-inch 1075 high carbon steel blade, meticulously hand-finished and honed to razor-sharp precision. The walnut handle not only adds an air of sophistication but also contributes to the machete's durability for long-lasting performance.

The accompanying heavy-duty canvas sheath acts as a reliable ally, securing the machete during travel while keeping it lightweight and easy to carry, even during extended hikes in the wilderness.

Now, let's address the drawbacks. The machete's blade measures slightly over 12 inches in length, which may be somewhat short for some individuals' preferences. Nonetheless, it strikes an ideal balance between strength and maneuverability. However, the handle, made of premium walnut, is relatively lightweight, a factor to consider if you're seeking a sturdy machete for demanding tasks.

In summary, the Condor Australian Army Machete is a reliable option for those venturing into the wilderness. It boasts a sharp blade, an elegant walnut handle, and a durable sheath for secure storage. Remember, though, that its lightweight nature may not be suitable for heavy-duty work.

The full-flat grind ensures reliability and sharpness, while the polished finish adds that classic touch. The chopper's handle, made from micarta, is comfortable even during enduring outdoor activities.
