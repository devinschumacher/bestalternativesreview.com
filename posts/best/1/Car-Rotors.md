<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Car+Rotors?utm_term=raybestos-66565r-car-disc-brake-rotors"><img alt="raybestos-66565r-disc-brake-rotor-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/raybestos-66565r-disc-brake-rotor-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When it comes to finding a reliable disc brake rotor for your car, it can be a challenge, especially when you're looking for a high-quality product at an affordable price. I recently had the opportunity to try out the Raybestos 66565R disc brake rotor, and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. 

One of the highlights of this rotor is the G3000 qualified material used in its construction, ensuring a long-lasting, dependable performance. It's safe to say that I put this rotor through its paces during my daily commutes, and it never let me down. The non-directional ground finish made installation a breeze, and the tight lateral runout reduced pedal pulsation and brake noise, making for a smoother driving experience. 

However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. I did encounter a few minor issues, such as some thickness variation leading to slight vibrations. But overall, the pros far outweigh the cons, and I have no qualms recommending this disc brake rotor to fellow drivers in search of a reliable and high-performance product.

Symmetric vane and split-core castings provide uniform heat distribution, ensuring optimal performance and longevity. The black e-coat anti-corrosive coating offers superior protection compared to competitors' spray paint options, contributing to overall durability. 

However, there are some drawbacks to this brake rotor. Users have reported issues with corrosion resistance in certain conditions, such as prolonged storage or exposure to moisture. Additionally, while the product has received positive reviews from most users, a few have encountered problems with the disc ground friction surface, which could impact overall performance. 

Considering the pros and cons, the Centric 120.63072 Premium Disc Brake Rotor is a well-engineered product that delivers a reliable and dependable braking experience. Users appreciate its reasonable price and compatibility with various vehicles, making it a solid choice for those in need of replacement disc brake rotors.

I recently tried out the PowerStop Z36 Extreme Truck and Tow brake pad and rotor kit. As someone who does a lot of towing and hauling, I was looking for a product that could handle the added stress on the brakes. Let me tell you, this kit exceeded my expectations! 

First off, I was impressed with the low-dust ceramic formula brake pads, reinforced with carbon fibers to strengthen the compound. Not only were they dust-free, but they also provided increased braking power without sacrificing everyday drivability. I noticed a significant difference in my overall braking performance after installing these pads and rotors. 

The PowerStop Z36 kit also came with drilled & slotted performance rotors for maximum cooling. This feature kept my brakes cool even during long, steep inclines or high-speed highway driving. I was also pleased to see that the rotors were cast using the finest G3000 metallurgy with strict OE tolerances, ensuring a perfect, bolt-on upgrade without any modifications needed. 

One thing I appreciated about this kit was the inclusion of stainless steel installation hardware and high-temperature ceramic brake lubricant. This made the installation process a breeze and ensured that my brakes were properly lubricated for optimal performance. 

However, one downside I encountered was that the rotors warped after just a year of use. I had to replace them, which was disappointing considering the high price point. 

Despite this minor setback, I would definitely recommend the PowerStop Z36 Extreme Truck and Tow brake pad and rotor kit to anyone looking for a reliable, durable, and high-performance solution for their towing needs.

Overall, I'd highly recommend the Bosch Brake Disc Rotor for its excellent performance, rust-resistant coating, and reliable operation.
