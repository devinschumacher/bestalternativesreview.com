### [Revitalizing Dial Basics Hypoallergenic Bar Soap Set](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dial+Soap+Bar?utm\_term=revitalizing-dial-basics-hypoallergenic-bar-soap-set)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dial+Soap+Bar?utm_term=revitalizing-dial-basics-hypoallergenic-bar-soap-set"><img alt="dial-basics-hypoallergenic-bar-soap-2-count-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/dial-basics-hypoallergenic-bar-soap-2-count-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Dial Antibacterial Soap Bar - Spring Water Scents & Squeaky Clean Feel](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dial+Soap+Bar?utm\_term=dial-antibacterial-soap-bar-spring-water-scents-squeaky-clean-feel)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dial+Soap+Bar?utm_term=dial-antibacterial-soap-bar-spring-water-scents-squeaky-clean-feel"><img alt="dial-antibacterial-soap-bar-4-oz-select-scent-spring-water-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/dial-antibacterial-soap-bar-4-oz-select-scent-spring-water-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using Dial Soap Bar in my daily routine for a while now and I must say, it's a game-changer. The scent of spring water infused in it gives my skin a fresh and revitalizing wash every time. One thing that stood out to me is its "Squeaky Clean rinsing" ability - I don't have to scrub my skin off, it just effortlessly cleans it. It also leaves my skin feeling moisturized, which is a bonus. 

However, there are a couple of things that could use some improvement. The soap bar can be quite tricky to hold in wet hands due to its shape. Another issue I've noticed is that the bar tends to disintegrate quite fast after a few uses, which is not very economical. 

Overall, the Dial Soap Bar with its unique scent and moisturizing properties is a winner in my book. It's just a bit of a bummer about the shape and durability.

Dial's soap bar has become a part of my daily routine - it's rich, creamy lather that leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized, without any itchiness. The classic scent, reminding me of a fresh morning, is a pleasant surprise. However, I must admit the soap doesn't lather as much compared to some other products I've tried. 

But overall, it gets the job done and has even helped me clean my makeup brushes efficiently.

### [Dial Antibacterial Personal Soap: Long-lasting & Fresh Creamy Lather - 6 Pack](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dial+Soap+Bar?utm\_term=dial-antibacterial-personal-soap-long-lasting-fresh-creamy-lather-6-pack)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dial+Soap+Bar?utm_term=dial-antibacterial-personal-soap-long-lasting-fresh-creamy-lather-6-pack"><img alt="dial-deodorant-soap-antibacterial-personal-size-bar-gold-6-pack-3-2-oz-bars-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/dial-deodorant-soap-antibacterial-personal-size-bar-gold-6-pack-3-2-oz-bars-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who has been using Dial's Gold Soap for a good chunk of their life, I am always on the lookout for a new soap that can make them feel clean and smell amazing at the same time. After all, isn't that what soap is all about? 

When I came across this 6-pack of Personal Size Bars, I couldn't resist giving it a try. I was immediately impressed by the packaging - it's sleek and modern while still reminding me of the classic Dial bar soap that I've used for years. But enough about aesthetics, let's talk about what really matters - the soap itself. 

The first thing that stood out to me is the rich creamy lather that the soap creates. It's not too thick, not too thin, just right. And to my surprise, the lather didn't leave any residue on my skin or bathtub, which is a plus. 

Now, let's talk about the scent. As someone who isn't particularly fond of strong scents, the "Fresh Clean Scent" sounded a bit intimidating to me. But I was pleasantly surprised to find that the soap had a clean, refreshing aroma without being overpowering. I've been using it as a hand soap and shower soap, and it has left my skin feeling clean and smelling great. 

However, there is one thing that did get to me - the soap definitely has a strong scent to it. I found myself reaching for a fragrance-free soap when I needed a break from the powerful aroma. It's a good thing to note for those who prefer soaps with a more subtle scent. 

Overall, I am definitely a fan of the Dial Gold Bar Soap. It checks all the boxes for a good soap - it's effective at cleaning my skin, leaves no residue, and has a pleasant scent. But if you're looking for a more subtle scent, this soap might not be the best choice for you.

Overall, I'd say that the Lagasse Dial Antibacterial Deodorant Bar Soap is a great product for anyone looking for a mild and refreshing soap option. It's easy to use and perfect for any occasion.
