I love how the drawers glide effortlessly thanks to the metal runners. And despite my initial skepticism, the wooden frame gives this furniture piece a modern and functional look that fits well in my compact living space. 

However, there are a few things that I couldn't help but notice. The three-quarter extension is not as easy to use as one would expect, especially when trying to place bigger items into the drawers. And the wooden peg situation, I must say it was frustrating! When I was assembling this nightstand, it felt like a never-ending task due to the tight screws that just wouldn't cooperate. 

Despite the tiny drawbacks, overall, the Eloy nightstand is a functional and attractive addition to my home. And the low price point doesn't hurt either.

The included 3-in-1 USB charging cable was convenient and versatile, making it easy to charge a variety of devices. 

One downside I experienced was the fairly short cord that came with the nightstand. It was only long enough to reach a standard wall outlet, which meant I had to keep the nightstand close to the wall for the charging station to work. This could be a limitation for some users. 

Overall, the Casual Home Vanderbilt Nightstand with USB Port proved to be a functional and attractive addition to my bedroom. The 3-in-1 USB charging cable and smooth metal glides on the drawers were standout features.
