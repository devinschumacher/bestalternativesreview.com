### [Retro Blue 3.2 Cu ft Mini Fridge with Side Bottle Opener](https://serp.ly/amazon/Blue+Refrigerator?utm\_term=retro-blue-3-2-cu-ft-mini-fridge-with-side-bottle-opener)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Blue+Refrigerator?utm_term=retro-blue-3-2-cu-ft-mini-fridge-with-side-bottle-opener"><img alt="frigidaire-3-2-cu-ft-retro-mini-fridge-with-side-bottle-opener-efr376-blue-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/frigidaire-3-2-cu-ft-retro-mini-fridge-with-side-bottle-opener-efr376-blue-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently decided to add a Frigidaire Retro Mini Fridge to our game room, hoping it would be a stylish and functional addition. After using it for a few weeks, I have to say it was a bit of a mixed experience. 

On the positive side, the fridge looks absolutely beautiful in our space! I love the vintage-inspired design and the built-in bottle opener is a perfect touch. It's also relatively compact, making it a great fit for the limited space we have. And, despite its small size, it's got a decent amount of storage space for its price point. 

However, there were a few disappointments along the way. Firstly, the build quality felt a bit flimsy when I was putting it together. It might just be me, but I had a hard time believing that this little fridge could handle the weight of our regular stock of drinks and snacks. 

Now, let's talk about the functionality. Despite the advertised side bottle opener, I found myself trying to use it blindly a few times, accidentally breaking off a chunk of the handle in the process. Not a great start. 

The temperature control is also a bit of a struggle. It seems like it takes longer to reach its desired temperature and stays that way a lot less than one would hope. This led to a few unexpectedly warm beverages a few times. 

Finally, one thing that really caught me off guard was the noise level. I thought a mini fridge would be super quiet, but this one seems to struggle in this regard. It might not be so noticeable during typical use, but it's definitely made a few of my friends jump when they've walked into the room while it's running. 

All in all, while the Frigidaire Retro Mini Fridge has some definite pros, I'd recommend doing some serious research before buying one. It might not meet your expectations in terms of durability, functionality, and even noise level.
