I recently had the pleasure of using the AICO Hudson Ferry Driftwood 6-Drawer Chest, and it exceeded my expectations in many ways. The Acacia wood solids and veneer finish give it a natural, rustic look that exudes elegance. The matte silver diamond-shaped drawer pulls were a nice touch and added a sophisticated feel to the piece. 

The velvet-lined drawers with ball bearing glides made it easy to access my belongings and ensure they stay protected. I appreciate the cedar-lined bottom drawer, which helped keep my items fresh. However, I did notice a few small issues, such as a drawer guide that was slightly shorter than expected, some splinters, and difficulty cleaning the cedar-lined drawer. 

Fortunately, Wayfair's customer service was helpful in addressing these concerns. Overall, the AICO Hudson Ferry Driftwood 6-Drawer Chest was a beautiful and functional addition to my home, and I highly recommend it.

The Hudson 5-drawer dresser from Joss & Main is a stylish addition to my bedroom. Its medium oak finish blends well with the rest of my decor while its sleek design catches the eye.
