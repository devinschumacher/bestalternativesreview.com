When dealing with the discomfort of eczema and psoriasis, it's essential to find a product that not only helps relieve the symptoms but also calms the skin. That's where Salve-ation comes in - a 10ml bottle packed with potent essential oils that do just that. 

I remember the first time I tried it. The soothing scent hit me right away, filling the air with a comforting aroma. But that's not all it did. The lightweight formula moisturized my dry, red patches, and the antiseptic properties left my skin feeling cleansed and fresh. 

What stood out to me the most was the blend's ability to protect sensitive skin from infection as it healed. It was like a gentle, balancing hand on my skin, calming it down and inspiring a sense of tranquility. 

But like any product, there have been some minor cons. For instance, it took a couple of days for me to see a marked improvement, and I had to be extra cautious about avoiding allergic reactions. 

Overall, though, I'm glad I found Salve-ation. It's one of those products that you can rely on to help soothe eczema and psoriasis symptoms while also providing peace of mind. So, if you're someone who struggles with these skin conditions, give Salve-ation a try. It just might be the game-changer you need.

This oil is the ultimate multitasker, capable of soothing grief, boosting immunity, and even aiding with skin concerns. Not only does it have those fantastic benefits, but it also features a green, balsamic, lemon-wood scent that's simply irresistible.

It's always great to know exactly what's going onto and into your body, right? And this is not just some generic claim - it's USDA certified organic, ensuring that this oil is free from GMOs, grown without synthetic fertilizers, and not tampered with by harmful pesticides.

The only downside, if you can even call it that, is the scent of this oil. Although it's a rich, earthy balsamic aroma, some might find it a tad overpowering, akin to a spicy pine scent. But personally, it adds to its character for me.

The Lavender scent is another crowd-pleaser, creating a calming atmosphere wherever it's used. 

I also appreciate that SACATR ensures the oils maintain their original fragrance by bottling them with care. Their packaging – comprised of brown bottles with a dropper– aids in preserving the oils' potency and preventing degradation caused by light.

The Rosemary oil's uplifting scent has become a regular feature in my morning yoga sessions, serving as both a motivator and mood-booster. 

In terms of its practicality, these high-quality oils have found their place in my home's many spaces—be it the living room, kitchen, or even the car. Their widespread appeal also extends to massage facilities, spas, and beauty businesses.

## Buyer's Guide

If you're dealing with psoriasis, you might have heard about essential oils as a potential natural treatment. But with so many options available, it can be challenging to know which oils are suitable for your needs. This buyer's guide will provide you with essential features, considerations, and general advice for selecting the right essential oils for psoriasis. 


### Understanding Psoriasis

Psoriasis is an autoimmune condition that causes skin cells to grow and die too rapidly, leading to itchy, red, and sometimes scaly patches on your skin. It can be triggered by a variety of factors, such as stress, infections, and certain medications. While there is no cure for psoriasis, managing the symptoms can help improve your quality of life. Essential oils have been found to offer relief for some individuals, but it's essential to choose the correct one based on your specific needs and skin type.

### Choosing the Right Essential Oil

Not all essential oils are created equal when it comes to treating psoriasis. Here are some general guidelines to follow when selecting the right oil for your needs: 
1. Focus on therapeutic-grade oils: Ensure the essential oil you choose is high quality and therapeutic-grade, as these are more potent and effective for treating health issues. 


### Safety Considerations

While essential oils can be an effective treatment for psoriasis, they should be used with caution. Some oils can be irritating to the skin or cause an allergic reaction. Always do a patch test before applying any essential oil to a large area of skin, and dilute the oil with a carrier oil, such as coconut oil or jojoba oil, before use.

### Understanding Psoriasis and Its Effects on the Skin

Psoriasis is a persistent autoimmune skin condition that triggers accelerated skin cell growth. This results in rough, scaly, red patches on the skin, commonly referred to as plaques. Although the exact cause of psoriasis remains unknown, researchers believe that genetic and environmental factors play crucial roles. While essential oils are often suggested as a natural remedy for psoriasis, proper application is key to avoid adverse effects.

Psoriasis can affect various parts of the body, with common areas including the elbows, knees, scalp, and lower back. Triggers may include stress, infections, and specific medications. Although a cure for psoriasis does not exist, managing symptoms is essential for maintaining skin health and overall comfort. Research suggests that essential oils hold potential in alleviating psoriasis symptoms; however, further studies are required to confirm their effectiveness and safety.


### What Are Essential Oils and How Do They Operate?

Essential oils are concentrated plant extracts obtained from various parts of trees, flowers, seeds, and other plants. They are renowned for their unique fragrances and healing properties. Essential oils can be employed to improve mental well-being, reduce stress, promote relaxation, and even address skin conditions such as psoriasis. The oil is typically diluted with a carrier oil before application to the skin.

The therapeutic effectiveness of essential oils for psoriasis is attributed to their anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antioxidant properties. Some oils may assist in strengthening the skin's natural barrier, preventing moisture loss and alleviating the dryness associated with psoriasis. Essential oils can also be utilized to tackle other factors contributing to psoriasis, such as stress and certain environmental triggers. It is essential to consult a healthcare professional before using essential oils to treat psoriasis, as they may interact with medications or exacerbate certain health conditions.

### Which Essential Oils Are Advised for Psoriasis Alleviation?

Multiple essential oils are considered beneficial in managing psoriasis symptoms. These include: 
1) Lavender Oil - valued for its soothing and anti-inflammatory characteristics; 
2) Tea Tree Oil - an antibacterial and antifungal agent; 
3) Frankincense Oil - an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant oil; 
4) Patchouli Oil - aiding in regulating sebum production in the skin; and 5) Bergamot Oil - an oil with anti-inflammatory properties. Essential oils for psoriasis may be employed individually or blended with other compatible oils. However, avoid using natural products on inflamed skin, as certain essential oils may cause irritation or worsen the condition. Conduct a patch test before using a new essential oil to ensure there are no adverse reactions. Consult with a healthcare professional or a trained aromatherapist for recommendations tailored to your specific skin type and needs.


### How Should Essential Oils Be Applied for Psoriasis Relief?

Correct application of essential oils for psoriasis relief requires dilution and safety precautions. Always dilute essential oils with a carrier oil, such as coconut oil, olive oil, or jojoba oil. As a general guideline, use one to three drops of essential oil per teaspoon of carrier oil. This ratio can be adjusted based on individual skin sensitivity and the recommended usage instructions for the specific essential oil.

When applying essential oils for psoriasis relief, gently rub the diluted oil mixture onto the affected areas, avoiding skin scratching. Avoid using scented or fragranced products on the skin, as they may cause irritation or intensify psoriasis symptoms. If any redness, itching, or other adverse reactions occur, cease use and consult a healthcare professional.

### Can Essential Oils Be Used in Conjunction with Traditional Psoriasis Treatments?

Essential oils can function as a supplementary treatment alongside conventional psoriasis care. In some instances, patients may experience relief from using essential oils in managing their symptoms. However, it is crucial to consult with a physician before incorporating essential oils into your psoriasis treatment plan to ensure they do not interact with any medications or exacerbate your condition.

Furthermore, essential oils should never be employed as a sole treatment for psoriasis, as they do not address the underlying cause of the autoimmune disorder. Adopting a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, stress reduction, and regular exercise, can also contribute to overall skin health and psoriasis management.


### Are There Any Potential Side-Effects or Risks When Using Essential Oils for Psoriasis Alleviation?

Although essential oils are generally safe when used appropriately, improper use may result in side effects. Some essential oils, such as citrus oils, are photosensitive, meaning they can cause skin irritation or heighten the risk of sunburn upon exposure to sunlight. It is essential to avoid using these oils before sunbathing or utilizing a tanning bed.

Furthermore, essential oils should be kept away from the eyes, nose, and ears. Ingesting essential oils can lead to toxicity, as their concentration is high. Always store essential oils in a cool, dark location and away from children. If uncertain about using a specific essential oil or blend, consult with a trained aromatherapist or healthcare professional.
