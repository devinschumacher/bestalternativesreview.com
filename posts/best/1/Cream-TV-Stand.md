I've been using the Hudson TV Stand from Joss & Main for a while now, and I must say, I'm quite impressed with its design and functionality. The cream-colored finish adds a touch of elegance to my living space, while the modern style makes it a statement piece. It's perfect for my 58-inch TV, with ample storage space that keeps all my electronics neatly organized. 

One of my favorite features is the cable management cutouts; no more tangled mess of cords behind the TV. The drawers are spacious enough for everything, and the overall construction is sturdy. However, I did notice that some of the screws weren't tight enough, making the stand slightly wobble. But once I fixed that, it was as stable as ever. 

The best part is the excellent customer service - my items were delivered efficiently, and the white glove service ensured that everything was placed exactly where I wanted it, with zero mess or packaging. If you're looking for a stylish yet functional TV stand, this one might just be the perfect fit.

This Manhattan Comfort Hampton TV Stand in Maple Cream is a stylish and functional addition to any living room or bedroom. I recently assembled it, and it was a breeze to put together thanks to the easy-to-follow instructions and helpful video. The stand measures 53.54 inches long, 26.57 inches high, and 15.75 inches deep, making it a perfect fit for a 46-inch TV, which I happen to own. 

One of the standout features of this TV stand is the media and wire management grommets. These handy little holes keep your cables organized and hidden from sight, ensuring your setup stays as neat as the day you installed it. The stand includes two open shelves and two concealed cubby spaces, providing ample storage for your soundbar, gaming console, and other accessories. 

The retro style cut-out handles add a touch of elegance and charm to the piece, while the splayed legs made from solid wood offer extra durability. I appreciate the combination of a painted finish and finished pine wood, which gives the stand a sophisticated, modern look. 

However, there were some minor drawbacks to consider. Home assembly was required, which took a bit longer than anticipated. Additionally, the off-white color has a bit of a grey tint, which isn't immediately obvious from the product photos. Overall, I'm happy with this Manhattan Comfort TV Stand and would recommend it to anyone looking for a stylish and functional piece to showcase their TV.

I recently came across the Living Skog Mid-Century TV Stand in my search for a stylish and functional piece of furniture for my living room. I was drawn to its clean Scandinavian design and promised durability. 

Upon assembly, I quickly realized that while it did look attractive, the build quality wasn't as solid as I hoped. Even with two people helping, we faced some challenges during assembly and noticed a few imperfections in the hardware. 

As for the finishing lines, there is a somewhat stark contrast between the TV stand's color and the brown finish of the doors. It's not necessarily a deal-breaker, but it was worth mentioning. 

The storage space proved to be quite convenient, with the cabinet being roomy enough for all my items. However, the doors were a disappointment. They didn't close snugly, which meant that their contents were still visible. Additionally, the doors are fairly thin and felt quite flimsy, which didn't give me much confidence in their long-term durability. 

Despite its drawbacks, the Living Skog Mid-Century TV Stand does offer a unique and attractive addition to my living space. If you're in the market for a stylish piece that can meet your multimedia storage needs, it might be worth considering—just be prepared for the minor imperfections that come with it.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cream+TV+Stand?utm_term=oswald-68-in-alder-white-modern-tv-stand-for-75-in-hdtvs-and-below"><img alt="oswald-68-in-alder-white-tv-stand-fits-tvs-up-to-75-in-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/oswald-68-in-alder-white-tv-stand-fits-tvs-up-to-75-in-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As I've been using the Oswald TV stand in my living room, I've grown quite fond of its stylish design and functionality. The alder white finish, combined with the sturdy MDF materials, gives off a polished yet warm feel. The large doors with enclosed cabinets provide ample storage space for my remotes and game controllers, while the adjustable shelves keep everything neatly organized. 

The stand's versatility in accommodating TVs up to 75 inches makes it a great choice for entertainment spaces of all sizes. However, I must admit that the lower shelves would benefit from a higher weight capacity. This, in turn, made it a bit challenging to set up consoles that weigh more than 20 pounds. And lastly, I found that the weight capacity of the top shelf was lower than expected at 75 pounds. But, the easy assembly process made up for it. Overall, the Oswald TV stand has become an essential part of my living room, blending function and style seamlessly.

I appreciated the push-to-open system that made it easy to store and access my TV in a smooth manner. There were three closed sections in the cabinet for storage, which was quite useful in keeping things organized. 

However, there were a couple of downsides to this product. The doors didn't close evenly, which seemed to be a recurring issue. Unfortunately, the app was also not very helpful in processing returns, which can be a frustrating experience for customers. 

Overall, the Selline TV stand is an attractive option for those looking to upgrade their viewing experience, but be prepared for a few minor drawbacks.
