### [Forte 33" Freestanding All Refrigerator with No Frost Technology and Spill-proof Glass Shelves](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Crosley+Refrigerator?utm\_term=forte-33-freestanding-all-refrigerator-with-no-frost-technology-and-spill-proof-glass-shelves)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Crosley+Refrigerator?utm_term=forte-33-freestanding-all-refrigerator-with-no-frost-technology-and-spill-proof-glass-shelves"><img alt="forte-33-inch-freestanding-all-refrigerator-with-21-cu-ft-capacity-f21are-stainless-steel-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/forte-33-inch-freestanding-all-refrigerator-with-21-cu-ft-capacity-f21are-stainless-steel-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Forte freestanding refrigerator, and I must say, it's a game-changer for my daily life. My favorite feature was the No Frost Technology, which completely eliminates the dreaded task of manually defrosting. And let's be real, who wants to do that in the summer heat? 

The adjustable legs and easy-rolling wheels made it a breeze to place this beauty in my kitchen, and it's been a lifesaver during those unpredictable Chicago weather fluctuations. No more food thawing out in record time! 

While I enjoy having the option to convert between refrigerator and freezer, I do find myself reaching for the freezing compartment more often than not. And did I mention the spill-proof glass shelves? They make cleanup a breeze, and I can't remember the last time I mopped up a spill mess on my kitchen floor! 

Of course, no product is perfect, and although this fridge has been a joy to use, I do wish it had a more discreet temperature and door alarm. I think these alerts can be a bit of an eyesore in an otherwise sleek design. But hey, you can't have it all, right? 

In the end, the Forte freestanding refrigerator is a solid choice for anyone looking for a functional and stylish appliance. I might be biased, but I'd highly recommend it to a friend. It's quickly become a staple in my home, and I hope it brings the same convenience to yours! 


### [Forte F21SBS250SS 36-inch Stainless Steel Side-by-Side Refrigerator with Spill-proof Glass Shelves and LED Lighting](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Crosley+Refrigerator?utm\_term=forte-f21sbs250ss-36-inch-stainless-steel-side-by-side-refrigerator-with-spill-proof-glass-shelves-and-led-lighting)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Crosley+Refrigerator?utm_term=forte-f21sbs250ss-36-inch-stainless-steel-side-by-side-refrigerator-with-spill-proof-glass-shelves-and-led-lighting"><img alt="forte-f21sbs250ss-250-series-36-inch-stainless-steel-side-by-side-refrigerator-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/forte-f21sbs250ss-250-series-36-inch-stainless-steel-side-by-side-refrigerator-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Forte has thoughtful features that cater to your specific requirements. With its adjustable legs, placing this sleek unit in your home feels effortless, an important factor when transitioning from one apartment or home to another. Spilling is something we try to avoid, not just in the kitchen, and the Forte's Spill Proof Glass Shelves ensure that your groceries remain safely in place, even during vigorous restocking sessions. 

The LED lighting is not only aesthetically pleasing but also energy-efficient, leaving a smaller carbon footprint for you and the planet. The fridge takes convenience to a whole new level by containing spills and preventing them from leaking, making cleanup an absolute breeze. 

The Forte's total capacity ensures it can cater to all your refrigeration needs. But what stood out most about this unit is its built-in Internal Twist Icemaker, truly a game-changer for those who enjoy the cool, refreshing crunch of a homemade ice cube. 

However, as with all appliances, the Forte isn't without its drawbacks. Some users have reported an initial difficulty in assembly, but nothing that a bit of patience and the manufacturer's instructions can't resolve. And while the stainless steel exterior might be prone to fingerprints and smudges, a simple wipe-down can keep it gleaming for days. 

Ultimately, the Forte F21SBS250SS is an investment that delivers not just convenience but also a bit of luxury right at your fingertips. So why not treat your kitchen and your taste buds to this sleek, efficient, and reliable refrigerator? After all, you only live once, so you might as well live it comfortably and refreshed!

### [Vintage Retro Crosley Cool Refrigerator](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Crosley+Refrigerator?utm\_term=vintage-retro-crosley-cool-refrigerator)

I recently got my hands on the Commercial Cool retro fridge, and let me tell you, it's a game-changer. The fridge's unique blend of vintage style and modern efficiency was a breath of fresh air. One of the standout features for me was the separate true freezer compartment. It's not every day you get a fridge with its own designated space for frozen goods. 

Another highlight was the 2 full-width slide-out glass shelves. They made organizing my fridge a breeze, and I could easily see everything I had stored. The crisper and glass crisper cover were a thoughtful addition, perfect for keeping my fruits and veggies fresh for longer. 

However, there were a few areas where the fridge could use some improvement. The 6 can dispenser rack was a bit tricky to operate, and I found myself manually opening it most of the time. Additionally, the tall bottle door storage could be a bit more accommodating for larger bottles. 

Despite these minor setbacks, the Commercial Cool retro fridge has been a reliable and stylish addition to my home. Its vintage charm combined with its practical functionality has made it a staple in my daily life.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Crosley+Refrigerator?utm_term=modern-3-door-french-door-refrigerator-in-white"><img alt="18-cu-ft-smart-counter-depth-3-door-french-door-refrigerator-in-white-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/18-cu-ft-smart-counter-depth-3-door-french-door-refrigerator-in-white-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Galanz Single Door Compact Refrigerator](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Crosley+Refrigerator?utm\_term=galanz-single-door-compact-refrigerator)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Crosley+Refrigerator?utm_term=galanz-single-door-compact-refrigerator"><img alt="galanz-gl27s5-single-door-compact-refrigerator-2-7-cu-ft-stainless-steel-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/galanz-gl27s5-single-door-compact-refrigerator-2-7-cu-ft-stainless-steel-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Galanz compact refrigerator and it's been a game-changer for me. First of all, the sleek stainless steel look is absolutely attractive, making it a great addition to any living space. It fits perfectly in my dorm room and has become a lifesaver for keeping my drinks and snacks cold. The 2.7 cu ft size is just right, offering enough space to store a variety of items without taking up too much room. I love how the two-liter bottle storage keeps bottles upright, which saves me space and makes it easy to grab a cold drink whenever I need it. 

However, there's one aspect that could use some improvement - the freezer compartment. I found that it's quite small and limited in terms of storage capacity. While I can fit two small items, I wish there was more space to store larger items or even more shelves to utilize the available space better. Another minor downside is the noise level when the refrigerator is running. It's not super loud, but it's noticeable enough to warrant mention. 

Despite these small drawbacks, I'm really happy with the performance of this compact refrigerator. It keeps my items cold and close at hand, which is exactly what I need on busy days. The easy-to-clean design is appreciated as well, making maintenance a breeze.

Additionally, the AutoFill Water Pitcher ensures you always have fresh, filtered water. 

One aspect I wasn't a fan of is the hinge design. The fridge door is wider than the opening, so you might need to modify your surrounding structure to accommodate it. The shelf adjustments are also something to consider; they might not meet everyone's needs. 

Overall, this refrigerator is practical and stylish, with some minor drawbacks. It's made a great addition to my kitchen and is a solid choice for families who prioritize convenience and organization.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Crosley+Refrigerator?utm_term=galanz-compact-refrigerator-stainless-steel-look-2-door-estar-model"><img alt="galanz-4-6-cu-ft-stainless-steel-look-2-door-estar-compact-fridge-with-freezer-silver-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/galanz-4-6-cu-ft-stainless-steel-look-2-door-estar-compact-fridge-with-freezer-silver-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who has been using the Galanz compact fridge for a few weeks now, I must say that I've been impressed by its sleek design and convenient features. The stainless steel look not only adds a touch of elegance to my space but also seems to be holding up well against accidental knocks and smudges. 

One of the first things that struck me about this fridge was its spacious interior. I've managed to fit everything I needed, from chilled drinks to frozen treats, without any issues. The adjustable thermostat has made it easy to maintain the ideal temperature, and the separate freezer compartment has been a lifesaver when it comes to storing ice packs and frozen snacks. 

However, there have been a couple of downsides to using this fridge. For one, it tends to make quite a bit of noise when the compressor kicks in, which can be a bit disruptive, especially during late-night snacks. Additionally, the door seals seem to need a bit of adjustment at times, as I've noticed some frost buildup on the back wall. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I've been quite satisfied with the Galanz compact fridge overall. It's easy to clean, quiet when in use, and has been a reliable addition to my living space.
