Recently, I had the chance to try on the Bape Blue Sk8 Sta #1 sneakers, and let me tell you, they are worth every penny. The leather uppers and embroidered branding make these shoes stand out in a crowd. I really appreciate how comfortable they are, considering their timeless and wearable retro style.

### [Bape Bapesta #5 Light Grey Shoe](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Bape+Shoes?utm\_term=bape-bapesta-5-light-grey-shoe)

I can't get enough of these Bape Bapesta #5 sneakers in Light Grey. The sleek and minimalistic design is a refreshing change from most other shoes in my collection. The smooth leather upper has a timeless appeal that catches the eye, and the subtle details, like the tonal Sta logo and the embossed Ape Head graphic, give the sneaker a unique personality. I particularly like the branding on the woven tongue tag and back tab, which adds a touch of exclusivity. The Ape Head emblem on the cupsole is a fun touch that really ties the whole look together. 

While I've had these sneakers for a few weeks now, one thing that has stood out to me is the robustness. I didn't think the cupsole would add as much durability as it has, but so far, I've seen no evidence of wear. So far, these have been a reliable and stylish choice for my everyday wear.

The leather upper felt both durable and breathable, giving my feet a comfortable fit.

One thing that stood out to me was the attention to detail in the design. The green camouflage pattern was not only eye-catching, but it also provided a unique touch to these shoes. The rubber sole provided excellent grip, making them a reliable choice for both indoor and outdoor activities. 

However, I will admit that the sizing seemed a bit off for me, as I had to exchange them for the perfect fit. The exchange process was smooth, but it was a minor inconvenience nonetheless. 

Overall, these Bape sneakers are a great addition to any streetwear enthusiast's collection. Their timeless design, coupled with the comfort and durability they offer, make them an excellent investment for anyone looking to elevate their style. 


### [Adidas Bape Stan Smith Collaboration](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Bape+Shoes?utm\_term=adidas-bape-stan-smith-collaboration)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Bape+Shoes?utm_term=adidas-bape-stan-smith-collaboration"><img alt="adidas-stan-smith-x-bape-in-white-size-12-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/adidas-stan-smith-x-bape-in-white-size-12-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on a pair of the BAPE x adidas Stan Smith in white, size 12. This sneaker is not only a collaboration between two iconic brands, but it also celebrates Bape's 30th anniversary. The shoe is made out of white leather, which is accompanied by an embossed Bape camouflage print on the upper. I was particularly drawn to the gold lettering on the lateral side that reads "Stan Smith, " and the co-branded tongue tag that showcases Bape's unique STA logo. 

The shoe's design also includes a woodland blend of green, brown, and tan hues on the heel tab, providing a classic look. The shoe rests on a vintage off-white-finished rubber cupsole, which felt quite durable. However, using this shoe in my daily life, I came across a couple of issues. Firstly, the quality control on StockX seemed off, as I received a shoe with a dirty appearance and a torn box. This led to a bit of disappointment. 

All in all, the BAPE x adidas Stan Smith in white, size 12, is an interesting blend of two influential brands. While the shoe itself has its unique charm, the StockX delivery left me feeling unsatisfied. Nonetheless, if you are a fan of Bape's iconic STA logo and enjoy the heritage of Stan Smith sneakers, this could be a shoe to add to your collection.
