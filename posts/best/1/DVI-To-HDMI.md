## FAQ


### What is DVI to HDMI conversion?

DVI to HDMI conversion refers to the process of connecting a DVI display (digital visual interface) to an HDMI-compatible device (high-definition multimedia interface). This conversion allows older devices with DVI ports to be connected to newer devices with HDMI ports. DVI to HDMI converters are used to bridge the gap between the two incompatible interfaces. 

These converters come in various types, including passive and active. Passive converters only require a cable, while active converters need an external power source. The choice between the two depends on the specific device and the distance between the DVI and HDMI devices being connected. Active converters may be necessary for longer distances or to support higher resolutions or faster refresh rates. 


### What is the difference between an active and passive DVI to HDMI converter?

The primary difference between active and passive DVI to HDMI converters lies in their ability to convert and transmit signals. Passive converters only provide a physical connection via a cable and rely on the existing DVI signal to be compatible with HDMI. Active converters, on the other hand, convert the DVI signal to HDMI via a built-in chip and may require an external power source. 

Passive converters are generally less expensive and simpler to use, making them suitable for shorter distances and basic video applications. Active converters can be more versatile, providing a more reliable connection and support for higher resolutions and faster refresh rates over longer distances. It is essential to choose the appropriate type of converter based on the specific needs and requirements of your setup. 


### What are some common issues with DVI to HDMI converters?

Some common issues that users may encounter with DVI to HDMI converters include signal loss, compatibility problems, and poor audio quality. Signal loss can occur due to the distance between the DVI and HDMI devices or the use of passive converters when a stronger signal is required. Compatibility issues can arise if the DVI to HDMI converter is not compatible with the specific device or if the converter does not support the required resolution or refresh rate. 

Poor audio quality can be an issue with some converters, especially when using passive converters. In these cases, the audio may be transmitted through the DVI cable, which may not offer the best sound quality. It is essential to choose a high-quality converter that supports HDMI audio to ensure optimal audio performance. 


### How do I choose the right DVI to HDMI converter?

To choose the right DVI to HDMI converter, consider the following factors: the distance between the DVI and HDMI devices, the required resolution and refresh rate, the presence of an audio signal, and compatibility with the connected devices. Passive converters are generally less expensive, but they may not support longer distances or higher resolutions. Active converters offer better performance but may require an external power source and can be more expensive. 

It is essential to read the specifications of the converter carefully and ensure that it is compatible with the connected devices. Selecting a reputable brand and checking customer reviews can also help to ensure that you choose a high-quality converter that meets your requirements and provides reliable performance. 


### What are some good DVI to HDMI converter brands?

Some well-regarded brands for DVI to HDMI converters include Monoprice, UGREEN, and StarTech. Monoprice offers a wide range of affordable converters with various features, while UGREEN offers both passive and active converters in various resolutions and lengths. StarTech provides high-quality active converters with a focus on compatibility and reliability. 

It is essential to read customer reviews and check the specifications of the converter before purchasing to ensure that it meets your needs. Additionally, checking compatibility with your specific devices and considering their requirements is crucial in selecting the right brand and product for your setup. 


### Can DVI to HDMI converters support 4K resolution?

Yes, some DVI to HDMI converters can support 4K resolution, depending on the specific model and manufacturer. 4K resolution refers to a higher resolution screen (3840 x 2160 pixels) than the standard 1080p (1920 x 1080 pixels) used by most HDMI devices. To ensure that the converter supports 4K resolution, it is essential to check the specifications and compatibility with the connected devices. 

It is also crucial to ensure that the connected devices support 4K resolution, as some may require a firmware update, while others may have compatibility issues with specific converters. Reading customer reviews and checking the manufacturer's specifications can help determine if a particular converter supports 4K resolution and will work with your specific devices.
