### [Renewable Rain Water Scented Candle by Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Clean+Candles?utm\_term=renewable-rain-water-scented-candle-by-mrs-meyers-clean-day)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Clean+Candles?utm_term=renewable-rain-water-scented-candle-by-mrs-meyers-clean-day"><img alt="mrs-meyers-clean-day-7-2-oz-rain-water-soy-scented-candle-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mrs-meyers-clean-day-7-2-oz-rain-water-soy-scented-candle-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day Rain Water Soy Scented Candle for some time now, and I must say, it's a delightful addition to my daily life.

However, there is one minor issue that I should mention: the wick can be a bit stubborn when it comes to igniting. But once it's lit, the flame is small and doesn't release as much scent as expected. This might not be an issue for everyone, but it's something worth mentioning. 

Overall, the Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day Rain Water Soy Scented Candle is a great choice for those who appreciate a clean and fresh scent with a touch of nature. It's a lovely addition to your home, and its eco-friendly nature is a bonus. 


### [Pleasant Orange Clove Soy Candle for a Cozy Home](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Clean+Candles?utm\_term=pleasant-orange-clove-soy-candle-for-a-cozy-home)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Clean+Candles?utm_term=pleasant-orange-clove-soy-candle-for-a-cozy-home"><img alt="mrs-meyers-clean-day-orange-clove-soy-candle-7-2-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mrs-meyers-clean-day-orange-clove-soy-candle-7-2-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've had the pleasure of trying out Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day Orange & Clove Soy Candle, and let me tell you, it's much more than just a candle. This 7.2 oz beauty is not only a fantastic scent for your home, but it also comes with a touch of holiday magic. 

First off, the scent is absolutely exquisite. It's a delightful combination of orange, clove, and warm, spicy notes that make this candle perfect for the holiday season. It's not one of those overwhelming scents that you either love or hate; it's just the right balance of citrus and spice, making it a crowd-pleaser. 

The reason I chose this particular candle is because of its ingredients. Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day candles are made from soy wax, a non-toxic, renewable resource. But it's not just the wax that's eco-friendly; the entire product is. The glass jar is recyclable, the formula is cruelty-free, and the brand is committed to keeping animals safe. This is a candle you can feel good about using. 

However, like any product, it's not all rosy. The candle does burn for 35 hours, so if you're looking for a long-lasting scent, you'll get that. But, it's not as strong or persistent as I would have liked. On a few occasions, I had to light it twice to get the same amount of scent. 

Despite the minor drawback, I'm still glad I chose the Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day Orange & Clove Soy Candle. It's a fantastic addition to my home, and the scent has been a wonderful surprise. I've used soy candles before, but none quite like this one. If you're looking for a warm, delightful, and eco-friendly candle to enhance your holiday spirit, this one's a winner. 


### [Eco Candle Co. 8oz Mason Day Clean Sheet Candle](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Clean+Candles?utm\_term=eco-candle-co-8oz-mason-day-clean-sheet-candle)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Clean+Candles?utm_term=eco-candle-co-8oz-mason-day-clean-sheet-candle"><img alt="eco-candle-co-8oz-mason-clean-sheet-day-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/eco-candle-co-8oz-mason-clean-sheet-day-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who loves to appreciate the scent of natural products, I recently stumbled upon the Eco Candle Co. 's 8oz Mason Clean Sheet Day candle. The moment I opened the package, I was greeted with a faint aroma of mango and honey, just as promised, but as I lit it up, the scent transformed into something unexpected and unpleasant. 

One of the highlights of this candle is its eco-friendly nature, with a 100% soy wax, it's a great choice for those who are environmentally conscious. The packaging, a vintage looking mason jar, is a pleasant touch and adds a rustic charm to my living space. 

However, despite these pros, there was also a rather significant con. Upon lighting the candle, the smell turned into a rather strong scent of super glue. To say it was unbearable would be an understatement. I was disappointed as the initial scent was promising, but the final scent was not what I, or the reviewers, had in mind. Despite this, I still appreciate the company's dedication to using quality, natural ingredients. 

Despite my unfortunate experience with the scent, I wouldn't dismiss the brand entirely. The Eco Candle Co. 's mission to create unique, eco-friendly products is commendable. For others, the positive reviews of the other scents could indicate an overall satisfactory product. It's just a pity that the Clean Sheet Day didn't deliver for me in terms of its scent.

### What are Clean Candles?

Clean Candles are a new concept of candles that have been designed with eco-friendly and non-toxic materials. They are made from natural soy wax and lead-free cotton wicks, which make them free from toxins, carcinogens, and allergens. These candles are perfect for people who want to enjoy candles without the negative side effects. They burn cleanly and evenly, providing a pleasant fragrance without producing toxic smoke or soot.

### What makes Clean Candles different from traditional candles?

Clean Candles are different from traditional candles in several ways. Firstly, they are made from natural soy wax, which is a renewable resource, and contains no petroleum products. This makes them a far more sustainable choice compared to traditional paraffin candles, which are derived from petroleum products. 

Another major difference is that Clean Candles have lead-free cotton wicks, which burn cleaner than traditional candle wicks. Lead is a toxin that is often found in candle wicks, and it can be harmful to human health. Clean Candles do not contain any lead, making them a healthier choice for your home.

### How do Clean Candles burn?

Clean Candles burn cleanly and evenly, providing a long-lasting and sustainable glow. The natural soy wax used in Clean Candles has a lower melting point than paraffin wax, which allows the candle to melt evenly. This results in a slower and more even burn, which reduces the risk of the candle tunneling or burning unevenly. 

Clean Candles also have a slower burn rate compared to traditional candles, which means they last longer. This is because soy wax has a lower melting point, which allows the wax to liquefy and release the fragrance more slowly. This results in a more pleasant and prolonged scent experience. Overall, Clean Candles provide a sustainable, clean, and healthy way to enjoy candles. 


### What are the benefits of using Clean Candles?

Clean Candles offer several benefits compared to traditional candles. Firstly, they are made from natural and renewable resources, which makes them a more sustainable and eco-friendly choice. This is particularly important for people who are concerned about climate change and the environment. Clean Candles also do not contain any toxic materials, which makes them a healthier choice for people who suffer from allergies or respiratory issues. 

Clean Candles also have a lower carbon footprint compared to traditional candles. This is because soy wax is a renewable resource, and its production has a smaller environmental impact compared to petroleum-based products. Additionally, Clean Candles have a slower burn rate, which means they last longer, reducing the need for frequent replacements.
