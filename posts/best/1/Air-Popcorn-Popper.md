I recently tried out the Presto Hot Air Popper and I must say, it's been a game-changer for my popcorn needs. First of all, it's so much healthier than using a pot on the stovetop - no oil required! I've been using it with regular popcorn and it's worked wonderfully well. The butter melter doubles as a measuring cup, which is a thoughtful touch. 

However, there are a couple of things that could use some improvement. For starters, it does not preheat like some other poppers, which might be due to the lack of an on/off switch. Also, the popcorn chute can be a bit messy if you don't catch the kernels in the right bowl. But overall, it's been a satisfying experience so far and the health benefits make it worth it.

However, while the popcorn was indeed hot and flavorful, sometimes the popcorn would not all come out of the air part, leaving some behind.

One of the standout features of this popcorn maker was its small, compact design. It easily fit under my kitchen cabinets and took up minimal counter space. I love how convenient it is to use in my busy daily life. 

However, I did notice a few minor drawbacks with this product. The capacity is quite small, producing only about 8 cups of popcorn at a time, which might not be ideal for larger gatherings.

Cleaning up was easy too - just wipe it down with soap and water. The only downside I found was the countertop size. While it's convenient, it's also quite small which might limit the amount of popcorn you can make at once.
