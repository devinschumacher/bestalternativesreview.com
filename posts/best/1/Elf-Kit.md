### [ELF Luxe Lash Kit: Starstruck Edition](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Elf+Kit?utm\_term=elf-luxe-lash-kit-starstruck-edition)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Elf+Kit?utm_term=elf-luxe-lash-kit-starstruck-edition"><img alt="elf-luxe-lash-kit-starstruck-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/elf-luxe-lash-kit-starstruck-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently gave the ELF Luxe Lash Kit, Starstruck, a try and was pleasantly surprised by the results. The set includes double layer, crisscross lashes that give your eyes a naturally smoky liner effect while opening them wide. The lash band is made of soft, flexible material that moves easily with every eye shape, making it comfortable to wear. The expertly tapered hairs blend seamlessly into your natural lashes, giving you a flattering look. 

One of the things I appreciated the most about this lash kit is the precision applicator included in the package. It made applying the lashes a breeze, even for a lash novice like me. The applicator allowed for easy placement, ensuring that the lashes were evenly distributed on my lash line. 

However, one downside I encountered was the need to break in the lashes. On my first try, the inner portion of the lash kept popping up, making it difficult to achieve a smooth, natural look. But with a bit of persistence, I managed to break them in, and they stayed in place for the entire day. 

Overall, I'm glad I tried the ELF Luxe Lash Kit, Starstruck. The pros definitely outweigh the cons, and I look forward to using this product in my makeup routine again.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Elf+Kit?utm_term=elf-on-the-shelf-polar-props-cooking-school-kit"><img alt="elf-on-the-shelf-polar-props-cooking-school-set-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/elf-on-the-shelf-polar-props-cooking-school-set-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Say Goodbye to Shine Elf Kit for Oily Skin](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Elf+Kit?utm\_term=say-goodbye-to-shine-elf-kit-for-oily-skin)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Elf+Kit?utm_term=say-goodbye-to-shine-elf-kit-for-oily-skin"><img alt="e-l-f-say-goodbye-to-shine-mini-kit-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/e-l-f-say-goodbye-to-shine-mini-kit-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried the "Say Goodbye to Shine Mini Kit" from e. l. f. It consists of the "Oil Control Pink Powder Mask, " "Oil Control Pore Minimizing Serum, " and "Oil Control Liquid Lotion. " The highlight for me was the "Oil Control Pink Powder Mask. " I applied it on my T-zone and let it dry for ten minutes before rinsing it off. I must say, it made a significant difference in the appearance of my pores. 

One thing I noticed was that these are ideal for all skin types, but especially beneficial for those with oily skin. After using this kit for a month, I've seen a considerable reduction in the amount of shine on my skin, which has made my makeup look flawless for much longer than usual. 

However, there was one issue I faced - the "Oil Control Pore Minimizing Serum" seemed a bit too thin for my taste. I needed just a drop of it to cover my entire T-zone, and while it did control shine, it didn't feel as thick or nourishing as I expected. But overall, these are great products for the price, and I'd definitely recommend them to friends experiencing the same struggles with oil control.

Delight in festive self-care this holiday season with the Elf-Care Kit from Pinch Provisions. This playful package offers a cozy night in with eight cheerful essentials.

### [E.L.F. Hello Hydration Kit - Essential Beauty Essentials](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Elf+Kit?utm\_term=e-l-f-hello-hydration-kit-essential-beauty-essentials)

I was pleasantly surprised by the affordable and dermatologist-developed e. l. f. Pure Skin Back to Basics Mini Kit. It includes a gentle, non-foaming cleanser that works well on my sensitive oily skin, a lightweight toner, and a moisturizer with a slight matte finish. 

The key ingredients, such as oat milk and niacinamide, give my skin a soft and supple appearance. However, the toner didn't wow me, and the moisturizer was slightly heavier than expected for my dry skin type. 

Overall, the e. l. f. Pure Skin Back to Basics Mini Kit is a great value for those looking for an affordable and effective skincare line for oily and sensitive skin. 


### [Elf Skin Hit Kit: Ultimate Makeup Essentials](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Elf+Kit?utm\_term=elf-skin-hit-kit-ultimate-makeup-essentials)

I recently tried the e. l. f. Skin Hit Kit and I'm impressed with the variety of products included. It's a great value at around $15 and you can often find it on sale for even less. The hemp-derived Cannabis sativa lip balm is a standout feature, as it leaves my lips soft, smooth, and hydrated without being too greasy. The mini Puff Puff Primer is a creamy consistency that absorbs quickly, leaving my skin hydrated and my makeup looking smoother and lasting longer. The Happy Hydration Cream is lightweight and goes on easily, leaving my skin feeling soft and hydrated. 

One downside is the All The Feels Facial Oil is a bit heavy on scent for my personal taste, but it does absorb quickly and leaves my skin feeling moisturized. Overall, I'd highly recommend this kit for anyone looking for a versatile, hydrating skincare collection, especially since all e. l. f. products are cruelty-free and vegan. 


### [e.l.f. Cosmetics Flawless Concealer Brush & Sponge Set](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Elf+Kit?utm\_term=e-l-f-cosmetics-flawless-concealer-brush-sponge-set)

One of the standout features of this set is the brush's softness and ease of use. I also appreciate its versatility - the different shapes and bristles make it convenient for various makeup tasks. However, there's one issue that I've noticed - shedding. Some bristles do fall out occasionally, which can be a bit frustrating. 

Despite this minor drawback, I'm overall quite satisfied with the e. l. f. Cosmetics Brush & Sponge Set for its affordability and the way it enhances my makeup application. The set is easy to clean and I've had no trouble with smells or drying times. The shape retention is solid, which is a relief.

The water cream, on the other hand, is a soothing and moisturizing treat for my acne-prone skin, keeping it hydrated and balanced. 

While the scent of this skincare set is quite pleasant, I've noticed that my skin can feel a bit drier than usual after using the products, especially when I use them all together.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Elf+Kit?utm_term=e-l-f-17-piece-ultimate-brush-kit-for-makeup-enthusiasts"><img alt="e-l-f-cosmetics-17-piece-ultimate-makeup-brush-set-travel-roll-vegan-and-cruelty-free-makeup-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/e-l-f-cosmetics-17-piece-ultimate-makeup-brush-set-travel-roll-vegan-and-cruelty-free-makeup-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the e. l. f. Ultimate Makeup [Brush Set](https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativesreview.com/blob/main/posts/best/1/Brush-Set.md) & Travel Roll, and I must say, it's been a game-changer in my daily makeup routine. As someone who's always on the go, the compact and easy-to-carry case is a major plus in my book. 

Opening the set, I was impressed by the variety of brushes it contains. From the Flawless Face Brush to the Concealer Brush and the Small Precision Brush, there's a brush for every step of the makeup process. I particularly love the Eyeshadow "C" Brush; it's perfect for blending and diffusing eyeshadow to create a seamless look. 

What really stands out, though, is their commitment to being vegan and cruelty-free. It's great to see a brand that not only creates high-quality products but also thinks about the wellbeing of animals. 

The only downside I've found is the fan brush. While it's cute and serves its purpose, I find that it doesn't hold powder as well as some of my other brushes do. But overall, the e. l. f. Ultimate Makeup Brush Set & Travel Roll has made my morning routine so much easier and hassle-free.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Elf+Kit?utm_term=elf-skincare-hydrated-ever-after-mini-kit-moisturizing-gentle-and-effective"><img alt="e-l-f-skincare-mini-kit-hydrated-ever-after-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/e-l-f-skincare-mini-kit-hydrated-ever-after-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Trying out the E. L. F. Skincare Mini Kit, Hydrated Ever After, introduced some exciting skincare elements to my daily routine. The mini kit combines a face cream, eye cream, makeup melting cleansing balm, daily cleanser, and hydrating booster drops in a single, travel-friendly box. 

As someone with dry skin, the face cream stood out as the star product. It offered just the right amount of hydration without leaving residue under my makeup. The makeup melting balm had a learning curve but eventually became a go-to for removing stubborn makeup. It was also nice to include an eye cream in the kit, providing a gentle solution for refreshing my skin. 

On the negative side, I found the soap not as appealing and the packaging slightly confusing. The scent of the eye cream also gave me pause, as it reminded me of an expired foundation. However, the other products in the kit made up for these minor drawbacks. 

In conclusion, the E. L. F. Skincare Mini Kit, Hydrated Ever After offered a mix of gentle, effective skincare products. While not every product was a home run, overall the kit delivered on its promise to hydrate and improve skin texture. As a daily skincare enthusiast, I found the set a great addition to my routine, and would recommend it, especially for those beginners looking to try a variety of skincare products.
