### [Energy Star Certified Dehumidifier for Home Basement Up to 3,500 sq.ft (35 Pints) with WiFi Control](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dehumidifier?utm\_term=energy-star-certified-dehumidifier-for-home-basement-up-to-3500-sq-ft-35-pints-with-wifi-control)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dehumidifier?utm_term=energy-star-certified-dehumidifier-for-home-basement-up-to-3500-sq-ft-35-pints-with-wifi-control"><img alt="dehumidifier-for-home-basementup-to-3000-sq-ft-35-pints-50-pints-2012-doe-standard-dehumidifierenerg-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/dehumidifier-for-home-basementup-to-3000-sq-ft-35-pints-50-pints-2012-doe-standard-dehumidifierenerg-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

It's been a few months since I got my hands on the Duracomfort Dehumidifier, and let me tell you, it has been a game-changer in my home! I have a pretty large basement, about 3000 sq. ft, and this bad boy removes up to 35 pints (50 pint 2012 Doe Standard) of moisture per day. Talk about a life-saver! 

Honestly, I've been in so many damp, musty basements in my life that I was dreading going down there after getting this dehumidifier. But as soon as I started using it, everything changed. Gone were the days of my basement looking and feeling like a swampy jungle. Now, it's much more like a calm, cozy cave with this Duracomfort Dehumidifier managing the humidity levels. 

Now, let's talk about some of the key features. First, it's got these built-in wheels and handles, making it easy as pie (and slightly more complicated than pie! ) to move it around. Plus, this sleek, clean look is a design win for me. Oh, and the fact that it's Energy Star certified? That's a big win for the environment too. 

The WiFi function is probably my favorite feature. I'm the kind of person who can't always remember things, so knowing I can control my dehumidifier from my smartphone is such a relief. And let's not forget about that smart warning system. It tells you when your filter needs cleaning and your tank is full. It's like having a little robot butler for your dehumidifier! 

Now, I'm not going to say this dehumidifier has been perfect. It's not the quietest thing in the world, especially on the highest settings, and it can be a bit intimidating to deal with. But with a little bit of patience and some learning, I'm glad I made the investment. 

Overall, the Duracomfort Dehumidifier has been a total game-changer for me, taking my basement from a swampy mess to a comfortable and cozy haven. Highly recommended! 


### [Maximum Coverage Dehumidifier: 6,000 Sq. Ft. Bucket](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dehumidifier?utm\_term=maximum-coverage-dehumidifier-6000-sq-ft-bucket)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dehumidifier?utm_term=maximum-coverage-dehumidifier-6000-sq-ft-bucket"><img alt="120-pt-maximum-coverage-area-6000-sq-ft-bucket-dehumidifier-in-whi-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/120-pt-maximum-coverage-area-6000-sq-ft-bucket-dehumidifier-in-whi-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Waykar dehumidifier for the past few months, and it's been a game-changer for my home. As someone who lives in a humid area, the 120 pint maximum coverage has been a lifesaver for maintaining a comfortable living space. The smart touch control panel is incredibly user-friendly, with an easy-to-read humidity readout that makes it simple to adjust levels as needed. 

One of the standout features of this dehumidifier is its energy efficiency. As an ENERGY STAR certified product, it's a great option for those looking to reduce their energy consumption and environmental impact. Plus, the automatic defrost and self-drying functions ensure that this machine operates at optimal performance, even in colder environments. 

But don't get me wrong, it's not flawless. While the whisper-quiet operation is a definite plus, the unit's portability could use some improvement. The 360-degree wheels are a great feature in theory, but in practice, they don't seem to roll as smoothly as I'd like. However, the stowable top handle does make it more manageable when moving it from room to room. 

Overall, the Waykar dehumidifier has been a reliable addition to my home. While there's certainly room for improvement, its energy efficiency, easy-to-use controls, and impressive moisture removal capacity make it a worthwhile investment for those in search of a high-quality dehumidifier. 


### [Waykar 34-Pint Smart Dehumidifier for Large Spaces](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dehumidifier?utm\_term=waykar-34-pint-smart-dehumidifier-for-large-spaces)

I recently tried the Waykar Smart Home Dehumidifier in my humid basement, and let me tell you, it made a considerable difference. This dehumidifier is super easy to move around thanks to its casters and recessed handle. It's not a small machine either, but it's surprisingly lightweight, making it effortless to move from room to room. 

The unique design of this dehumidifier looks right at home in modern spaces. It offers impressive coverage, and I've noticed a significant improvement in air quality and a more comfortable environment. The touch control makes it a breeze to adjust settings, even for someone like me who isn't tech-savvy. 

However, it's worth mentioning that the drain hose isn't included, which can be a bit of a hassle. But overall, I'm quite pleased with this dehumidifier's performance and easy use. It's a worthwhile investment for anyone dealing with humidity issues. 


### [Meaco Low Energy Dehumidifier with Air Purifier and HEPA Filter](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dehumidifier?utm\_term=meaco-low-energy-dehumidifier-with-air-purifier-and-hepa-filter)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dehumidifier?utm_term=meaco-low-energy-dehumidifier-with-air-purifier-and-hepa-filter"><img alt="meaco-low-energy-dehumidifier-with-air-purifier-and-hepa-filter-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/meaco-low-energy-dehumidifier-with-air-purifier-and-hepa-filter-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the opportunity to try out the Meaco Low Energy Dehumidifier with Air Purifier and HEPA Filter. This little dehumidifier has been a lifesaver in my household, dealing with dampness and mold in our basement. 

One of the standout features is its advanced HEPA filtration system, which not only removes moisture effectively but also cleanses and purifies the air. And the laundry mode has proved incredibly handy for drying clothes, ensuring they come out evenly dried without any hassle. 

What's more, this dehumidifier's modern intelligent design is quite impressive. Its unique 2-in-1 mode allows for year-round utility, making it a versatile choice for any home, while the child lock and automatic cut-outs add an extra layer of safety. Not to mention, it operates incredibly quietly at only 46dB, perfect for using while sleeping or working from home. 

However, I did notice that despite it being designed specifically for the UK climate, it can take a bit more energy to get it to a suitable level of dehumidification and air purification, compared to some other models available in the market. Nonetheless, it remains an excellent investment for those needing a reliable dehumidifier with a touch of luxury. 

To sum up, the Meaco Low Energy Dehumidifier with Air Purifier and HEPA Filter is a powerful, efficient, and quiet addition to any home, especially for those in the UK looking to combat dampness issues. Its intelligent design and additional features definitely make it stand out in a crowded field of similar products.

I recently started using the Midea Cube 50Pint Dehumidifier and it has been a game-changer for my home. The unique lift-and-twist design allows it to be flexible in form, offering an extended capacity when in extended mode. I've appreciated not having to constantly empty the tank, as a busy schedule can be hectic. 

The dehumidifier is versatile and quiet, making it perfect for my home. The patented sensor and Wi-Fi enabled app make it easy to monitor humidity levels at my fingertips. I've noticed the difference in the comfort of my home, as it maintains the desired humidity without being loud. 

The multi-directional air intake and up to three different fan speeds work well to dehumidify the room. However, I did notice that it is not as energy-efficient as I had hoped. My utility bill seems to have increased since I started using the dehumidifier. 

Overall, the Midea Cube 50Pint Dehumidifier is a convenient and effective addition to my home, but I've found its energy efficiency to be lacking, which is a downside.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dehumidifier?utm_term=ktaje1220x-dehumidifier-large-2000-sq-ft-solution-for-basements-and-garages"><img alt="50-pt-2000-sq-ft-dehumidifier-with-bucket-and-drain-hose-for-basement-garage-with-auto-defrost-24h-t-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/50-pt-2000-sq-ft-dehumidifier-with-bucket-and-drain-hose-for-basement-garage-with-auto-defrost-24h-t-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

AIRPLUS's 50 Pt. dehumidifier is a game-changer for those battling damp basements or muggy garages. 

This dehumidifier stands out from the rest, offering a range of humidity levels from 40% to 80% RH. The 50 pint capacity is perfect for areas up to 2,000 square feet, making it a strong contender for living rooms, bathrooms, and bedrooms. 

The adjustable temperature setting is a major bonus, while the auto-defrost and 24-hour timer bring added convenience. As an ETL Certified and ENERGY STAR-compliant model, it's environmentally friendly. Overall, a standout choice in a sea of humidity fighters. 


### [GeneralAire 100-Pint Whole House Dehumidifier](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dehumidifier?utm\_term=generalaire-100-pint-whole-house-dehumidifier)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dehumidifier?utm_term=generalaire-100-pint-whole-house-dehumidifier"><img alt="general-aire-100-pint-whole-house-dehumidifier-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/general-aire-100-pint-whole-house-dehumidifier-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried the General Aire 100 Pint Whole House Dehumidifier, and let me tell you, it was a game-changer for my living spaces. I live in a humid climate, and it's challenging to keep the air fresh and comfortable. This dehumidifier stood out to me because of its LCD Touch Screen with Wi-Fi control, which allowed me to set and monitor the humidity levels at the touch of a button. 

The air flow of the dehumidifier is impressive, moving 220 cubic feet of air per minute. It effectively circulates the air and helps to quickly lower the humidity to a comfortable level. One downside; however, is the high energy consumption. It draws 10.8 amps, so I'd recommend running it during the day when your electricity bill isn't as high. Other than that, the dehumidifier has performed superbly in my home and is a must-have for those looking to battle humidity issues in their living spaces. 


### [Mini Dehumidifier with LED Light and 24/7 Operation](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dehumidifier?utm\_term=mini-dehumidifier-with-led-light-and-24-7-operation)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dehumidifier?utm_term=mini-dehumidifier-with-led-light-and-24-7-operation"><img alt="kloudic-700ml-small-dehumidifiers-with-led-light-2200-cubic-feet-215-sq-ft-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/kloudic-700ml-small-dehumidifiers-with-led-light-2200-cubic-feet-215-sq-ft-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

It's not just a handy device, but it has an added touch of aesthetic appeal. I placed it in my bathroom, a room that often feels stuffy, and within moments, it began to show signs of improvement. 

One of the things that stood out for me was the machine's silent operation. It uses Peltier technology that ensures a whisper-soft operation, allowing me to run it 24/7 without any disruption. 

As for its compact size, it is perfect for small spaces like my bathroom. It's easy to move around and doesn't take up much space, which adds to its overall convenience. Plus, its modern design with a colored LED night light makes it a stylish addition to any room. 

However, it's not all perfect. The water tank can be quite heavy when full, and it requires regular emptying. Also, while it works efficiently, the coverage area is limited, making it less suitable for larger rooms. 

In conclusion, the Kloudic small dehumidifier is a handy and silent device that helps rid humidity from small spaces. With its eye-catching design and quiet operation, it's a worthwhile investment for those looking to improve their indoor air quality. 


### [Costway 1500 Sq. ft Portable 24 Pints Dehumidifier for Large Rooms](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dehumidifier?utm\_term=costway-1500-sq-ft-portable-24-pints-dehumidifier-for-large-rooms)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dehumidifier?utm_term=costway-1500-sq-ft-portable-24-pints-dehumidifier-for-large-rooms"><img alt="costway-1500-sq-ft-portable-24-pints-dehumidifier-to-large-room-with-3-color-led-light-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/costway-1500-sq-ft-portable-24-pints-dehumidifier-to-large-room-with-3-color-led-light-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I had the chance to try out the Costway 24 Pint Dehumidifier myself and let me tell you, it was a game-changer for my humid living room. As soon as I plugged it in and turned it on, I could already hear the difference. I was pleased by how quiet it was, even on the highest setting, making it perfect for late-night use without disturbing my sleep. The dehumidifier fits perfectly in my space, efficiently catering to the 1,500 sq. ft area. 

One of the standout features that I appreciated was the LED light. It adds a cozy touch to the room and was a pleasant surprise. The touch panel was user-friendly and easy to navigate, even for someone like me who isn't tech-savvy. The water tank indicator saved me from numerous trips up and down the stairs to check the water level. 

However, the process of emptying the water tank can be a bit more labor-intensive as it required me to use a plastic pitcher, which I had to clean and dry afterward. Also, the manual wasn't clear enough about the child-lock feature, which I wished I could have used to keep my curious toddler from playing with it. 

Overall, the Costway 24 Pint Dehumidifier was a significant improvement in my living environment, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to control humidity in their space. 


### [GE 22-Pint Energy Star Smart Dry Dehumidifier - White](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dehumidifier?utm\_term=ge-22-pint-energy-star-smart-dry-dehumidifier-white)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dehumidifier?utm_term=ge-22-pint-energy-star-smart-dry-dehumidifier-white"><img alt="ge-22-pint-energy-star-portable-dehumidifier-with-smart-dry-for-damp-spaces-white-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ge-22-pint-energy-star-portable-dehumidifier-with-smart-dry-for-damp-spaces-white-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

In a humid environment, I often found myself struggling with musty odors and damp surfaces. That's when I discovered the GE - 22-Pint Energy Star Portable Dehumidifier with Smart Dry. This little gem has been a game-changer in my home, especially for the basement. 

The Smart Dry feature is truly a smart decision. It automatically adjusts the fan speed based on the humidity levels in the room, making it effortless to maintain optimal humidity levels. Moreover, the Empty Bucket Alarm is a lifesaver, alerting me when it's time to empty the bucket without the hassle of constant checking. 

On the downside, I wished the Continuous Drain Connect came with a drain hose. While the Digital LED Controls are easy to manage, I find that there are only two fan speeds which might not cater to everyone's comfort. The built-in pocket handles and easy-roll wheels make moving it a breeze, but they seem a bit flimsy. 

Despite these small drawbacks, I wholeheartedly recommend the GE - 22-Pint Energy Star Portable Dehumidifier with Smart Dry for anyone looking to keep their damp spaces comfortable and dry. It may not be perfect, but it's proved to be a reliable addition to my home.

I've had the chance to use this Costway Dehumidifier in my home, and I must say, it's been a game-changer in terms of creating a comfortable living environment. The dehumidifier can remove up to 24 pints of moisture from the air in no time, making it ideal for medium rooms up to 1,500 sq. ft. 

One feature I particularly appreciate is the adjustable humidity range between 30-80 percent. It's been incredibly easy to find the perfect humidity level for my home using the intelligent touch control panel. And not only does it help regulate the air quality, but the reusable and washable filter is an added bonus that's kept the air in my home fresh and clean. 

As for the negatives, I've noticed that the dehumidifier can be quite heavy due to its large capacity, which can make it a bit difficult to move around. However, the 4 universal wheels do help with its portability. 

Overall, this dehumidifier has offered me a comfortable and healthy living environment, which has been worth the investment. I highly recommend it for anyone looking to create a similar atmosphere in their home, office, or other medium to large spaces. 


### [hOmeLabs 1,500 Sq. ft. Energy Star Dehumidifier for Moist Rooms & Basements](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dehumidifier?utm\_term=homelabs-1500-sq-ft-energy-star-dehumidifier-for-moist-rooms-basements)

I recently tried out the hOmeLabs 1,500 Sq. ft Energy Star Dehumidifier in my large living room and found it to be quite efficient. The most noticeable feature was its ability to effectively remove moisture from the air, reducing odors and making breathing easier. However, I did notice that the surrounding air temperature increased slightly during use, so I had to adjust the thermostat accordingly. 

One of the highlights of this dehumidifier is its easy-to-use interface, which allows you to set your desired moisture level and let it run continuously without worrying about overfilling the tank. I also appreciated the drain hose outlet feature, which allowed for continuous draining during operation. Additionally, the built-in pump compressor and Turbo mode were great for controlling the fan speed and ensuring maximum moisture removal. 

While the dehumidifier was mostly effective, I did encounter a couple of drawbacks. First, the humidity control seemed less accurate than I would have liked, causing the fan to run constantly instead of stopping when the desired humidity level was reached. Second, the unit emitted heat while in use, making it unsuitable for rooms with existing evaporative coolers. 

Overall, I found the hOmeLabs 1,500 Sq. ft Energy Star Dehumidifier to be a useful tool in managing moisture levels in my home. Its portability and ease of use make it an appealing option for those looking to improve the air quality in medium to large living spaces.

## Buyer's Guide

When it comes to maintaining a healthy and comfortable home environment, many homeowners have turned to dehumidifiers. These appliances are specifically designed to remove excess moisture from the air, helping to alleviate mold and mildew growth. 


### Important Features to Consider

Selecting the right dehumidifier for your needs means considering several important features. Here are a few key aspects to think about, including capacity, noise level, energy efficiency, and control options. By understanding these features, you will be better equipped to make an informed purchase decision.

### Capacities and Sizing

One of the most crucial factors in choosing a dehumidifier is its capacity or what's referred to as a 'pints' or 'liters per day' rating. Capacity ranges from small units suitable for small areas (less than 1,000 square feet) to large models capable of tackling thousands of square feet. Ensure that the unit you select can handle the size of the area you want to dehumidify. 


### Noise Levels

Noise levels can also be important when considering a dehumidifier, especially if it will be located in your living space. Units with rotating fan blades tend to be noisier than those with more efficient compressor-based designs. Look for units that provide a noise rating or a decibel range so that you can determine which one best suits your needs.

### Energy Efficiency

Dehumidifiers can consume significant amounts of electricity, so energy efficiency should be a top concern. It's not only better for your wallet but also for the environment. Look for models that use less energy without sacrificing performance – Energy Star ratings can be a helpful tool in this regard.

### What are dehumidifiers used for?

Dehumidifiers are designed to remove excess moisture from the air, making them ideal for use in spaces with high humidity levels. They are frequently used in basements, crawl spaces, and other areas with damp conditions. By reducing humidity, dehumidifiers help prevent mold and mildew growth, protect wood furniture and structures from decay, and improve overall air quality. 

Dehumidifiers come in various sizes, capacities, and features, allowing you to choose the best option for your specific needs. Some models can even be used to dehumidify larger spaces, like garages and storage rooms, or to tackle moisture issues in small apartments or offices with limited ventilation. 


### How do dehumidifiers work?

Dehumidifiers use one of two primary methods to remove moisture from the air: compression cooling or absorption refrigeration. Compression cooling works by compressing a refrigerant gas, which causes it to evaporate and absorb moisture from the air. This moist gas, now in its liquid state, is then condensed back into a liquid and drained from the unit. Absorption refrigeration, on the other hand, uses a desiccant or absorbent material to attract and hold moisture from the air. The process creates a pressure differential that drives the damp air through the dehumidifier, trapping excess moisture in the desiccant. Once the absorber becomes saturated, it's normally heated to release the moisture. 

Additionally, most dehumidifiers have a built-in fan that circulates air, improving the distribution of moisture removal throughout the room it's in. Some models also features a built-in humidistat, which allows for automatic shutoff once the desired humidity level is reached. Overall, dehumidifiers are designed to make it easier to maintain a comfortable and healthier indoor environment by reducing moisture levels.

### What is the best dehumidifier for a small space or apartment?

For smaller spaces, like apartments or bedrooms, a compact, portable dehumidifier with a lower capacity (up to 50 pints) would be a suitable choice. These models are easy to move and store, making them ideal for spaces with limited floor space. A dehumidifier with a built-in humidistat is also useful, as it can help maintain a consistent and comfortable humidity level in your home. 

Consider a unit with lower noise levels as well since these spaces are likely to be occupied by individuals seeking a quiet, comfortable living environment. Brands known for producing quality portable dehumidifiers include Frigidaire, Honeywell, and Whirlpool. Reading reviews and looking for efficient appliances can also help you pick the best dehumidifier for your small space needs. 


### What is the efficiency of a dehumidifier?

The efficiency of a dehumidifier is determined by its moisture removal rate, usually expressed in pints per hour (pph). Higher capacity dehumidifiers can remove more moisture from the air in a given time, making them more efficient for larger spaces or tougher moisture issues. Pints per hour should be considered when choosing the right size dehumidifier for your space. Most dehumidifiers range from 20-70 pints per hour, with professional-grade models often reaching higher capacities. 

Another factor affecting dehumidifier efficiency is the compressor size, which can impact its ability to remove moisture quickly. Generally, larger-sized compressors are more powerful and efficient, allowing for faster moisture removal. Energy efficiency is also an important factor to consider, as a unit that consumes less energy will run more cost-effectively over longer periods of use. Dehumidifier efficiency varies between brands and models, but you can expect top-tier units to be both high-capacity and energy-conscious, delivering the best performance for your investment.

### Can a dehumidifier protect my home against mold and mildew?

Yes, a dehumidifier can help protect your home from mold and mildew growth by reducing indoor humidity levels. High humidity provides a suitable environment for mold and mildew to thrive, while low humidity levels help minimize the risk of their growth. A well-chosen dehumidifier can effectively maintain comfortable indoor humidity, reducing the risk of mold and mildew formation in your home. 

It's essential to properly ventilate your home by opening windows, using exhaust fans, or ensuring good air circulation around vents to avoid the buildup of excessive moisture. However, even with proper ventilation, there may still be areas with high humidity or moisture problems, like crawl spaces or damp basements. In these cases, adding a dehumidifier can help bring moisture levels down and create a healthier indoor environment for you and your family. 


### Are there any dehumidifiers designed for outdoor use?

Yes, there are dehumidifiers specifically designed for outdoor use. These devices can handle environmental factors like humidity, rain, and varying temperature more effectively than indoor-only models. Outdoor dehumidifiers are typically more durable and have features like corrosion-resistant materials, weatherproof casings, and UV protection to cope with different conditions. 

An outdoor dehumidifier can be particularly useful for tackling humidity issues in covered outdoor living areas, large workshops, or garages. However, it's essential to ensure the model you choose is suitable for the specific outdoor space and climate. Consult the manufacturer's specifications or consult with a specialist to find the best outdoor dehumidifier for your needs.
