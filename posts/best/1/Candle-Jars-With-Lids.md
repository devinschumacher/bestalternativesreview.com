### What materials are used to create candle jars and lids?

Candle jars and lids can be made from a variety of materials, depending on aesthetics, functionality, and cost. Some common materials include glass, plastic, ceramic, and metal, such as stainless steel or brass.

Glass jars are visually appealing and durable but can be fragile and heavy. Plastic jars are lightweight and affordable, but their elegance and longevity may not compare to other materials.
