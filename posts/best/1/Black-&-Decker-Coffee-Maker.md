### [Black+Decker 12 Cup Switch Coffee Maker](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Black+%26+Decker+Coffee+Maker?utm\_term=blackdecker-12-cup-switch-coffee-maker)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Black+%26+Decker+Coffee+Maker?utm_term=blackdecker-12-cup-switch-coffee-maker"><img alt="blackdecker-12-cup-switch-coffee-maker-big-lots-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blackdecker-12-cup-switch-coffee-maker-big-lots-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a regular coffee enthusiast, I've used the Black+decker 12 Cup Switch Coffee Maker for some time now, and I've come to appreciate the quick and easy brewing experience it offers. The machine's ability to heat water to the optimal brewing temperature before hitting the coffee grounds guarantees maximum flavor extraction, a feature that I find truly impressive. However, there's a minor inconvenience - the Sneak-a-Cup function, while useful, can sometimes lead to the brewed coffee spilling over the burner and ending up on the counter. 

Additionally, the handle on this coffee maker leaves something to be desired. Unfortunately, it has a sharp, hollow construction that occasionally scrapes your skin when you grab it. To prevent any accidents, I'd recommend wrapping the handle with some [electrical tape](https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativesreview.com/blob/main/posts/best/1/Electrical-Tape.md), which should provide a comfortable grip. 

That minor handle issue aside, the Black&Decker Coffee Maker manages to deliver a hot, flavorful brew each time, and I'd gladly recommend it to fellow coffee lovers seeking a dependable and efficient brewing companion in their busy lives.

However, there were a couple of issues I encountered. The first one was the lid not closing fully, which made me doubt the product's build quality.

### [Black & Decker Gray Programmable 12 Cup Coffee Maker](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Black+%26+Decker+Coffee+Maker?utm\_term=black-decker-gray-programmable-12-cup-coffee-maker)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Black+%26+Decker+Coffee+Maker?utm_term=black-decker-gray-programmable-12-cup-coffee-maker"><img alt="black-decker-12-cup-programmable-gray-coffee-maker-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/black-decker-12-cup-programmable-gray-coffee-maker-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Black & Decker 12 Cup Programmable Gray Coffee Maker, and I must say, it's been a game-changer in my morning routine. The QuickTouch Programming feature was a breeze to use and allowed me to set the 24-hour auto brew time effortlessly. 

One standout feature for me was the Sneak-a-Cup function, which temporarily halted the coffee flow during brewing, letting me pour my first cup without making a mess or waiting for the whole pot to finish. This was particularly useful on those mornings when I was in a rush or just wanted a quick cup of coffee before heading out. 

Another noteworthy detail was the 2-hour auto shutoff feature, providing an added safety measure and peace of mind with every use. And the Easy-View Water Window on the front of the coffee maker allowed me to see the exact water level for my coffee, ensuring an accurate and consistent brew every time. 

Now, there were a couple of things I noticed that could be improved. The build quality seemed a bit flimsy compared to some other coffee makers I've used, which left me slightly concerned about its durability in the long run. Additionally, the gray color of the coffee maker was a bit harder to clean than I expected, especially around the buttons and the water window area. 

Overall, I found the Black & Decker 12 Cup Programmable Gray Coffee Maker to be a practical and user-friendly addition to my kitchen. Despite some minor drawbacks, the convenience and ease of use made it a worthy investment. Would I recommend this coffee maker to others? Definitely.

## Buyer's Guide

A good cup of coffee starts with the right coffee maker, and Black & Decker offers a wide range of options to choose from. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned brewer, this guide will help you find the perfect coffee maker for your needs. Let's dive in and explore the features, considerations, and advice for the Black & Decker Coffee Maker product category. 


### Choosing the Right Size

One important factor to consider when purchasing a Black & Decker coffee maker is the size. Coffee makers come in various sizes, ranging from single-serve to full-sized carafes that can brew multiple cups at once. Determine how many cups of coffee you'll need in the morning, and choose a coffee maker that can accommodate your needs. Remember, overfilling your carafe can lead to over-extraction and a bitter taste, so always aim for the correct capacity.

### Programmable Features

If you're an early riser or simply a busy person, programmable features can be a lifesaver. Black & Decker coffee makers often come with programmable settings that allow you to set your desired brew time. This is especially useful for those who want their coffee ready as soon as they wake up. Some models even have time delay settings, which can be set up to one hour before the actual brew time, giving you a perfect cup of coffee right when you need it. 


### Carafe Material

The material of the coffee carafe is an essential consideration. Black & Decker coffee makers come with various carafe materials, including glass, stainless steel, and thermal carafes. Glass carafes retain heat well, but they can also cause your coffee to lose flavor more quickly. Stainless steel carafes are durable and can maintain the coffee's temperature more effectively, but they may not retain the heat as long as glass carafes. Thermal carafes are designed to insulate the coffee, keeping it warm for longer periods, and are a popular choice among coffee enthusiasts. Choose a carafe material that best suits your preferences and needs.

Next, fill the reservoir with a mixture of equal parts white vinegar and water, and run the coffee maker through a full brewing cycle. 

After the brewing cycle is complete, allow the coffee maker to sit for a few minutes to allow the vinegar mixture to sit in the carafe and heating element. Then, discard the mixture, rinse the carafe and reservoir with clean water, and run a cycle with plain water to thoroughly rinse the coffee maker. It is also recommended to clean the permanent filter with warm, soapy water or a filter cleaning solution, and then rinse thoroughly before reinserting it into the coffee maker. 


### Are there any Black & Decker coffee makers with a thermal carafe?

Unfortunately, there are no Black & Decker coffee makers that come with a thermal carafe as a standard feature. However, some of their models do have a warming plate that helps keep the coffee warm for hours after brewing. This feature can be particularly useful for those who enjoy having a constant supply of hot coffee throughout the day. 

If a thermal carafe is a must-have feature for you, you may want to consider looking at other brands that offer coffee makers with thermal carafes, such as Cuisinart, Hamilton Beach, or Mr. Coffee. There are many options available on the market, so you should be able to find a coffee maker that meets your specific needs and preferences.
