### [Stylish Outdoor Daybed with Fade-Resistant Wicker: Better Homes & Gardens Willow Sage All-Weather Daybed](https://serp.ly/amazon/Day+Bed?utm\_term=stylish-outdoor-daybed-with-fade-resistant-wicker-better-homes-gardens-willow-sage-all-weather-daybed)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Day+Bed?utm_term=stylish-outdoor-daybed-with-fade-resistant-wicker-better-homes-gardens-willow-sage-all-weather-daybed"><img alt="better-homes-gardens-willow-sage-all-weather-wicker-outdoor-daybed-beige-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/better-homes-gardens-willow-sage-all-weather-wicker-outdoor-daybed-beige-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who spends a lot of time outdoors, I found the Better Homes & Gardens Willow Sage All-Weather Wicker Outdoor Daybed to be a perfect addition to my patio. The striking design of the daybed caught my eye immediately and made me excited to try it out. 

What struck me the most was the unique combination of materials used in this daybed. The sturdy steel frame, hand-woven wicker design, and fade-resistant fabric came together to create a seating option that felt both durable and comfortable. The inclusion of solution-dyed polyester cushions made with 50% recycled materials only added to the daybed's appeal. 

During my time using the Better Homes & Gardens Willow Sage All-Weather Wicker Outdoor Daybed, I appreciated the fact that it was easy to assemble and required minimal effort to put together. This made it an ideal choice for those looking to quickly add a cozy seating option to their outdoor space. 

However, there were a few areas that I felt could use some improvement. The first was the sizing of the daybed. While it provided comfortable seating for one person, it was a bit too small to accommodate two people comfortably. This meant that it was more suitable for solo relaxing rather than socializing with a friend or family member. 

Another issue I encountered was the quality of the cushions. While they were designed to be fade-resistant and stain-repellent, I noticed that they didn't hold up well in direct sunlight. This resulted in some fading and discoloration over time, which slightly detracted from the overall appeal of the daybed. 

Overall, the Better Homes & Gardens Willow Sage All-Weather Wicker Outdoor Daybed was a cozy addition to my outdoor seating arrangements. Its unique combination of materials and easy assembly made it an attractive choice, but its sizing limitations and the occasional wear caused by direct sunlight were minor drawbacks.

The slender profile was perfect, as it didn't take up too much space while still offering a lot of comfort and style.

I particularly loved the chevron pattern tufting on the backrest, which added a touch of elegance and sophistication to the overall design. 

However, there were a few things I noticed that could be improved. While the mattress didn't require an additional box spring or foundation, it didn't come with the mattress itself, which meant I had to purchase one separately. Additionally, the weight of the daybed was quite heavy to lift and carry around without assistance. 

Overall, though, the pros of the DHP Alicent Full Upholstered Daybed certainly outweighed the cons. This versatile piece of furniture was the perfect addition to my living space, offering both style and functionality in a compact package. If you're looking to add a unique touch of mid-century modern charm to your home, this daybed might just be the answer you've been seeking.

## Buyer's Guide

Day beds are versatile pieces of furniture, serving as both a comfortable seating area and a functional sleep space. Whether you're looking for a stylish addition to your living room, an inviting spot in your bedroom, or an outdoor oasis, there are countless options to suit your needs. In this buyer's guide, we'll explore important features, considerations, and general advice to help you choose the perfect day bed for your home. 


### Frame Materials: Wood vs. Metal

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Day+Bed"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Day-Bed-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Day-Bed-2" height="540"></a></div>

The frame of your day bed is an essential aspect to consider, as it determines durability, stability, and overall aesthetics. There are two primary materials to choose from: wood and metal. Wooden frames offer a classic, warm look and can be made from various types of wood, such as solid wood, veneered wood, or engineered wood. They are generally more expensive but can be more durable and provide better support. Metal frames, on the other hand, are lightweight, easy to assemble, and typically less expensive. They also offer more design options due to their sleek and modern appearance. Consider the aesthetic you're aiming for and the balance between cost, durability, and design when selecting the frame material. 


### Fabric: Cotton, Polyester, or Blend?

Day beds often feature removable cushions and pillows, which means you'll need to consider the fabric type for the upholstery. Common options include cotton, polyester, and blends. Cotton is comfortable, breathable, and durable, making it a popular choice for day beds. However, it may not be the most stain-resistant option, so be prepared to invest in regular cleaning to keep your day bed looking its best. Polyester is a synthetic alternative that is often more stain-resistant and easier to maintain. It may not be as breathable or comfortable as cotton, but it can withstand wear and tear for a longer period. Blended fabrics offer a compromise by combining the benefits of both cotton and polyester, such as durability and comfort.

### Size and Shape

Before purchasing a day bed, consider the dimensions and shape you're looking for. Day beds come in various sizes, ranging from compact to extra-large, so ensure you have enough floor space to accommodate your chosen option. Pay attention to the length and width, as well as any additional features like armrests or storage compartments. The shape of the day bed can also impact its functionality and appearance. Common shapes include square, rectangular, oval, and round, so think about which design aligns best with your room layout and decor style. Consider the number of people who will be using the day bed and the space required for comfortable lounging or sleeping to make an informed decision. 


### Outdoor vs. Indoor Use

Day beds can be used both indoors and outdoors, but it's essential to choose one that is suitable for the intended location. Indoor day beds usually have a softer, more plush appeal, with materials designed to withstand regular use in a controlled environment. Outdoor day beds, on the other hand, are designed to withstand harsh weather conditions such as sun, wind, and rain. Look for features such as UV-resistant fabrics, rust-resistant metal components, and durable materials to ensure your outdoor day bed can withstand the elements without sacrificing comfort.

### Discover the versatile world of day beds and how they differ from traditional beds

Get ready to dive into the world of day beds, a unique piece of furniture designed to provide maximum comfort and relaxation during the daytime. Contrary to a traditional bed, which is primarily used for sleeping, day beds offer a multi-purpose functionality that can turn any space into a cozy, laid-back haven. Typically, a day bed comprises a cushioned seat and a backrest, perfect for lounging, napping, or simply enjoying some leisure time. These functional, space-savvy furniture pieces are often compact and can double as a sofa or an extra seating area, making them a top choice for smaller homes or multi-functional rooms. 

Day beds come in various materials such as wood, wicker, metal, and upholstery, allowing you to choose the one that best suits your living space's style and aesthetic.

While day beds are not designed for long-term sleep, they can certainly serve as a comfortable spot for occasional naps or cozy reading sessions. Many day beds can be transformed into a sleeping area by adding a mattress or a comfortable cushion on top of the existing frame, allowing it to perform various functions depending on your needs and preferences. Additionally, some day bed frames come with built-in storage, providing extra bedding and pillows for an added dash of comfort when used as a sleeping area. Whether you're dealing with limited space or just looking for a versatile piece of furniture, a day bed is a perfect choice for your needs.
