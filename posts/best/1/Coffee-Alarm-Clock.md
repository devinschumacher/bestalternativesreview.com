But what she loved the most was the 2-in-1 wireless charger. It charged her phone and headphones simultaneously, making her life a lot easier. 

However, she also mentioned one drawback – the alarm clock didn't have a built-in battery backup. This meant that if there was a power outage, the alarm wouldn't go off. But overall, she was thrilled with her new alarm clock and its wireless charging capabilities. It has become an essential part of her daily routine, and she can't imagine living without it.

Last night, I set an alarm using this SXE Sxe87001 Wireless Charging Alarm Clock, hoping to catch a few extra zzz's. But much to my dismay, it barely woke me up. The alarm tone is annoyingly loud and harsh, enough to have me groaning in the morning.

However, there were some drawbacks to using this product.

### [Oct17 Wooden Qi Wireless Charging Alarm Clock](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Coffee+Alarm+Clock?utm\_term=oct17-wooden-qi-wireless-charging-alarm-clock)

### [iLuv Time Shaker 5Q Wow Clock Radio with Qi Wireless Charging and FM Radio](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Coffee+Alarm+Clock?utm\_term=iluv-time-shaker-5q-wow-clock-radio-with-qi-wireless-charging-and-fm-radio)

I started by programming my favorite FM radio station through the 5Q Wow main unit. With up to 10 preset stations to choose from, there's something for everyone. Plus, the convenient sleep timer lets me drift off to my favorite tunes at bedtime. If the radio's not my thing, the option to wake up to a traditional buzzer or a vibration shaker gives me even more flexibility! 

One of the most impressive features is the wireless charging pad, which can power up Qi-compatible devices. It's such a handy convenience, and I love that a second device can also be charged using the built-in USB port. 

The Time Shaker 5Q Wow Clock Radio also offers a thoughtful touch with its three brightness settings, allowing me to customize the clock display to match the lighting in my room. This small but mighty wake-up companion has made my mornings a breeze! 

There were a couple of setbacks, though. The radio has a default volume setting that reverts to when the alarm is activated, making it difficult to hear for heavy sleepers. While the vibration shaker is a great alternative, I wish it came with more preset options. 

Overall, the iLuv Time Shaker 5Q Wow Clock Radio has become an integral part of my morning routine, and I can't imagine starting my day any other way. It's a great combination of functionality and convenience, and I wholeheartedly recommend it as a reliable wake-up companion. 


### [Capello Dual Alarm Clock with USB Phone Charger - Stylish and Practical](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Coffee+Alarm+Clock?utm\_term=capello-dual-alarm-clock-with-usb-phone-charger-stylish-and-practical)

Capello's Dual Alarm Clock with USB Phone Charger has been my trusty sidekick for a while now. With its sleek white design and easy-to-read display, this little baby has had a spot on my bedside table for quite some time. 

One of the things I appreciate most about this clock is its dual alarm feature. It's perfect for those mornings when I need to wake up at two different times - now that's a game-changer! And let's not forget the USB 2A fast charging port. It's a lifesaver when I'm running low on battery power, and I can charge my devices right from my bedside. 

However, the backlit display is a bit of a hit-or-miss. While it's handy for seeing the time in the dark, it's not the best when it comes to preserving my night vision. And sometimes, the clock can be a bit too bright for my liking. 

Now, the 2AAA battery backup is a solid feature, but it's a bit of a hassle to have to remember to buy and replace those batteries. 

Overall, I've had a positive experience with Capello's Dual Alarm Clock with USB Phone Charger. It's been a reliable and convenient addition to my morning routine, but there is definitely some room for improvement. 


### [Relaxing Coffee Alarm Clock](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Coffee+Alarm+Clock?utm\_term=relaxing-coffee-alarm-clock)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Coffee+Alarm+Clock?utm_term=relaxing-coffee-alarm-clock"><img alt="loftie-clock-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/loftie-clock-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I had the chance to use the Loftie Clock for a few weeks, and I must say, it really lives up to its promise of enhancing my sleep experience. The first thing that stood out to me is the sleek, minimalist design that blends perfectly with my bedroom decor. It's like adding a little piece of art to my nightstand. 

What I found most impressive, however, is the variety of soothing sounds and alarm tones it offers. I could spend hours listening to the nature sounds, and the different wake-up tones have been a game-changer for me. No more groggy mornings! Plus, the gentle nightlight is a nice touch, making it easy to navigate in the dark without fully waking up. 

The app is user-friendly and offers plenty of customization options, allowing me to create my ideal sleep environment. However, I did notice that the alarm tones could use a bit more variety, as all of them seem to have an electronic element to them. Maybe incorporating some actual nature sounds would be a nice touch. 

One drawback I encountered is the app's performance. Sometimes it took a while to load and could be a bit glitchy. This was mostly noticeable when I was trying to add new alarm tones or sounds. Despite this, the functionality of the app was mostly fine. 

Another minor issue is the sound quality. While the wake-up sounds are plenty loud enough, they are a bit tinny and could use a bit more depth. It's not a deal-breaker, but it would be nice to have some richer-sounding tones. 

In conclusion, the Loftie Clock has been a pleasant addition to my daily routine. Its sleek design, abundance of soothing tones, and customizable features have made a noticeable difference in my sleep experience. Even though the app could use some refinement and the alarm tones could use a bit more variety, overall, it's a product I'd recommend to anyone looking to improve their sleep surroundings.

The alarm clock itself is simple in design yet effective. It features a bright digital display that's easy to read and set up. The alarm function is loud enough to wake me up in the morning, and the snooze button comes in handy when I need a few extra minutes to fall back asleep. 

However, there's one feature that I wish could be tweaked a bit - the LED display light. While it's bright and effective, it's a bit too much for my taste, especially considering it's right next to my bed. I would appreciate an option to dim the light or perhaps a switch to turn it off completely if I'm using the clock in a dark room. 

Despite this minor issue, I'm overall quite satisfied with the SHARP Digital Alarm Clock with Dual USB FastCharge charging ports. It's a versatile and practical addition to any nightstand, and the added convenience of the charging ports is a game-changer for someone who relies heavily on their devices.
