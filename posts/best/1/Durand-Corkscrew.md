One of the most outstanding features of this corkscrew is its non-stick Teflon spiral, which helps to ensure that the corks are removed without any damage or residue left behind. 

What stood out to me was the comfortable soft-touch under-belly of the handle, which made it a pleasure to hold and use. However, one minor drawback that I encountered was the inner lever blocking the teeth of the bottle opener, rendering it practically useless for that purpose. Despite this small issue, I still highly recommend the Murano Waiter's Corkscrew to anyone looking for a reliable and efficient tool for opening bottles of wine.

The Durand Corkscrew's foil cutter is designed to be easy to use and efficient at removing wine bottle foils. The cutter is housed in a scissor-like mechanism that opens and closes with a simple twist. To use the foil cutter, first open the scissor-like blades by twisting the handle. Then, position the blades around the neck of the wine bottle, making sure they are securely in place. 

When you feel the blades are in the right position, give them a quick twist to cut through the foil. After the foil is cut, close the blades to release the foil and complete the process. The foil cutter is designed to be reusable, so you can use it to remove foil from multiple wine bottles without having to replace it. The foil cutter's design is not only practical but also ensures that the corkscrew remains functional and user-friendly.
