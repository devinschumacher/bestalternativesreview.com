### [Dead On - DO-DES Destroyer Tech Pack: Professional EDC Backpack with 34 Pockets](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Edc+Backpack?utm\_term=dead-on-do-des-destroyer-tech-pack-professional-edc-backpack-with-34-pockets)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Edc+Backpack?utm_term=dead-on-do-des-destroyer-tech-pack-professional-edc-backpack-with-34-pockets"><img alt="dead-on-do-des-destroyer-tech-pack-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/dead-on-do-des-destroyer-tech-pack-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who's constantly on the go, I found the DO-DES Destroyer Tech Pack to be an essential companion. The heavyweight 1680 2-ply poly fabric gives you the reassurance that this bag will hold up to even the roughest treatment. My favorite feature? The molded handle that makes repositioning the bag a breeze while still sitting upright. 

The rear tech compartment, with its 3 pockets, is a life-saver for carrying my laptop, tablet, and files. I especially love the breathable straps - they're lined with moisture-wicking material, keeping me comfortable even on long, hot days. 

However, this bag isn't without its quirks. With 34 assorted pockets, it can be a bit too much to get organized and quickly access the item you need. There's also the designated cell phone holder that seems to swallow it whole, making it a little unpredictable where to find my phone next. Regardless of its few flaws, the DO-DES Destroyer Tech Pack is a reliable and practical option for those in need of professional-grade EDCs.

Whether you're carrying just a camera and a small cube or a full-on photography kit with the large cube, this backpack has you covered. 

However, I did encounter a couple of downsides during my trip. One thing that could use some improvement is the comfort of the backpack.

Despite these minor issues, overall, I'm quite happy with the Nomatic McKinnon Camera Backpack. The versatility, style, and customization options make it a solid choice for any photographer looking for a reliable and stylish bag to carry their gear.

### [Mil-Tec Large Camo 36L Flecktarn EDC Backpack](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Edc+Backpack?utm\_term=mil-tec-large-camo-36l-flecktarn-edc-backpack)

However, there was one issue I encountered - the backpack wasn't entirely waterproof, as I discovered when I accidentally spilled my water bottle. Although it was resistant to some extent, I would have appreciated a fully waterproof option, especially for those who plan on using it for camping or hiking in less-than-ideal weather conditions. 

Overall, the US Assault Pack Large 36L from Mil-Tec is a great option for those who need a versatile and spacious backpack for their outdoor adventures.

The exterior Velcro panels and daisy-chain webbing offer plenty of space to attach additional gear. 

The Link Pack Miltac also has a hydration system sleeve that can accommodate a 2-liter hydration system. The side pockets are perfect for holding small items like bug spray, sunscreen, and toilet paper. The main compartment is large enough to accommodate a laptop, books, or a jacket, depending on your needs. 

However, one thing I noticed is that the Molle system on the back could be more versatile. While it's useful for attaching additional gear, it could have been designed to be more adaptable.

However, there are a few things I'd like to see improved. The front crinkle nylon fabric has a bit of texture to it, but it also feels a bit rough and uncomfortable against my skin. As for the fleece-lined exterior pocket, while it's a nice touch, it's not large enough to accommodate much. 

Overall, I'd give the Berkeley Field Bag a solid 4 out of 5. It has a lot of great features, but there's still a bit of room for improvement in terms of comfort and functionality.
