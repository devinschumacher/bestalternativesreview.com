I was honestly impressed with the versatility of this Dewalt Combo Kit. It's like a toolbox on its own wheels with a 1/2 in. hammer drill, reciprocating saw, circular saw, impact driver, and LED work light - all equipped with FLEXVOLT technology. The two 4.0Ah batteries hold a good charge and the charger is included which is a plus. The case is sturdy and makes transporting these tools a breeze. 

However, I noticed that the FLEXVOLT ADVANTAGE technology, which is supposed to be tool chip ready, requires purchasing an additional chip (DCE042) separately. The kit lacks a few basic accessories that would be handy, let's say a drill bit set or extension cords. Overall, it's a powerful system, just be prepared to invest in extra components for optimal use. 


### [DeWalt DCK955X 18V Cordless XRP 9-Tool Power Combo Kit](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dewalt+Combo+Kit?utm\_term=dewalt-dck955x-18v-cordless-xrp-9-tool-power-combo-kit)

I recently had the privilege of using the DeWalt DCK955X 18V Cordless XRP 9-Tool Combo Kit in my workshop and I must say, I was impressed! This 9-piece kit comes with an array of tools, but my favorite was the DC825 18V cordless impact driver. It has a powerful 1,330 in-lbs of torque, making it a breeze to drive screws and bolts into tough materials. 

Another standout tool in this kit was the DC411 cut-off tool, which boasts a high-power 6,500 RPM for cutting and grinding. It's perfect for breaking down old concrete or cutting through thick metal pipes. One of my least favorite aspects of the kit was the DC390 18V circular saw. While the 6.5-inch carbide blade was decent for most tasks, I found that it struggled when cutting through heavier materials like 2x4s at a 45-degree angle. 

The DeWalt DCK955X 18V Cordless XRP 9-Tool Combo Kit also included a DW919 18V flexible floodlight, which provided hands-free, bright lighting in the dim corners of my workshop. However, I observed that the floodlight's battery life was rather short, especially when used in conjunction with other tools. 

To be honest, the highlight of this kit for me was the comprehensive set of tools it provided, as they were versatile and met my day-to-day needs. The one-year free service contract also added great value and peace of mind. Of course, nothing is perfect and there were a few minor downsides like the battery life of the DC390 circular saw and the floodlight, as well as the limited number of batteries provided. Nonetheless, this kit has been a valuable addition to my workshop and I can't wait to use it on more projects.

I recently had the chance to try out the DeWalt 20V Max Brushless XR 7-Tool Combo Kit, and let me tell you, it's quite the impressive setup. One of the first things that stood out to me was the battery life. The DCB205 20V MAX 5 Ah battery and DCBP034 20V MAX DEWALT POWERSTACK compact battery give you the power you need to tackle any job with ease, and the low-profile height of the power sander allows you to get close to the work surface for precise sanding.

As someone who's worked with cordless drill sets, I can tell you that DeWalt's 18V XR Combi Drill & SDS+ Plus Rotary Hammer Drill Twin Kit is a beast of a tool. 

The first drill, DeWalt's best-selling combo drill, is a wonder of engineering. It has a durable 13mm keyless chuck, two gearbox speeds, and a work light that doubles as a helpful hammer function. The drill's torque ring made it a game-changer for me; it allowed me to set the torque of the clutch, preventing any damage to screws from over-tightening or over-driving. 

Paired with the rotary hammer drill, it has DeWalt's solid construction and powerful performance that's unmatched. The side handle with built-in depth stop makes it incredibly easy to use without any mistakes. It also has a rotation-stop mode for light chiseling, which I found super handy when removing tiles from a wall. 

However, the battery life is a mixed bag. While they're powerful, the charge only lasts a couple of hours, which can be frustrating if you're working on a time-sensitive project. But if you're working on more extended tasks, these batteries will do the trick. 

Overall, I highly recommend DeWalt's 18V XR Combi Drill & SDS+ Plus Rotary Hammer Drill Twin Kit. It's a powerful, versatile set that's great for both professional trades and DIY enthusiasts.

The addition of the DCL040 20V MAX Lithium Ion LED Work Light was really thoughtful, providing better visibility and hands-free use in the workspace. 

The battery life hasn't gone unnoticed either, as it feels optimized for use. Also, the fact that it uses the same batteries and chargers as other Dewalt 20V MAX tools is a big plus. 

On the downside, the Bluetooth speaker included seemed a bit redundant and lackluster to some of the reviews I read. Additionally, some users mentioned that the charger was slow to charge, which definitely isn't a deal-breaker, but worth mentioning nonetheless. 

All in all, I’d say this combo kit is a powerful and convenient companion for construction and DIY enthusiasts with its varied tools and long-lasting batteries. It's worth the investment for anyone looking to streamline their work and reduce the number of tools in their toolbox.

### [Dewalt Handheld Blower Kit with String Trimmer and Brushless Combo](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dewalt+Combo+Kit?utm\_term=dewalt-handheld-blower-kit-with-string-trimmer-and-brushless-combo)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dewalt+Combo+Kit?utm_term=dewalt-handheld-blower-kit-with-string-trimmer-and-brushless-combo"><img alt="dewalt-handheld-blower-kit-string-trimmer-and-brushless-combo-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/dewalt-handheld-blower-kit-string-trimmer-and-brushless-combo-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a proud owner of several DeWalt power tools, I was excited to try the 20V MAX Combo Kit. However, my experience with this particular product was quite disappointing. The string trimmer, despite having a powerful gear drive transmission design and variable-speed trigger, was simply not up to the task of trimming my yard. The preloaded string kept coming lose, and even with the help of an authorized DeWalt tool drop off, I wasn't able to find a solution. 

On the other hand, the handheld blower was a different story. Featuring a brushless motor, it was powerful and efficient, easily clearing debris from my yard. However, the charging time for both the blower and the battery was quite long, and I found myself constantly swapping batteries to get the job done. 

Additionally, the lack of a larger protective shield on the trimmer was a major inconvenience. I had to deal with shredded weed residue and poison ivy, which was not only uncomfortable but also dangerous for my skin. Furthermore, the customer service provided by DeWalt was less than satisfactory, taking hours on the phone to resolve the issue with the trimmer. 

In conclusion, while the DeWalt 20V MAX Combo Kit had its ups and downs, I can't say it was worth the investment. The trimmer's performance left much to be desired, and the battery life of both the blower and the battery proved to be a hassle. However, the handheld blower part was powerful and suited its purpose, making it a mixed bag overall.

One highlight was the impressive battery life; the brushless motors seriously increased my runtime. The case included in the kit was a nice touch, keeping everything organized. However, the LED light on the impact driver could be brighter. 

Overall, I'm really pleased with this combo kit, and I think it would make a great addition to anyone's tool collection.

One thing that stood out to me right away was the knurled control rings on the sockets and wrenches. They provide a non-slip gripping surface, making it easier to install and remove fasteners without worrying about them slipping off. The chrome vanadium steel construction means these tools are strong, durable, and resistant to scratches and rust. 

However, the weight of this set is quite heavy, which might be a bit of a downside for some users. But the limited lifetime warranty from DEWALT ensures peace of mind while using this powerful and well-crafted mechanics tool set.
