### [Justin Bieber Award Style Doll: Collectible Pop Star Figure](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Collectible+Dolls?utm\_term=justin-bieber-award-style-doll-collectible-pop-star-figure)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Collectible+Dolls?utm_term=justin-bieber-award-style-doll-collectible-pop-star-figure"><img alt="justin-bieber-doll-jb-award-style-collection-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/justin-bieber-doll-jb-award-style-collection-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Recently, I got my hands on one of these Justin Bieber Award Style dolls, and I must say, it truly brought me back to his early days on YouTube. This 12-inch doll is a perfect representation of the pop icon - the hair, the clothes, and even the [microphone](https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativesreview.com/blob/main/posts/best/2/Microphone.md) and sunglasses included. As a collector of Justin's memorabilia, it was a must-have for me. The attention to detail in this doll's design is remarkable, and my friends who have seen it are always impressed. 

However, one thing I found a little annoying was the price. It might be a bit on the expensive side compared to other dolls of decent quality. The only other issue is the sound the doll produces when you press the button; it doesn't quite match Justin's voice, but hey, it's close enough for fun. 

In summary, my experience with the Justin Bieber Award Style doll has been an enjoyable and pleasant one. The doll is fantastic in design, but keep in mind that it comes with a hefty price tag.

I also adored the sticker sheet that came with her, featuring 7 classic Rainbow Brite stickers that perfectly complemented the overall experience. 

One slight miss, however, was the packaging, as I've seen a few reports of it being a bit damaged during delivery. But as long as the product itself is safe and sound, the excitement is certainly worth the minor inconvenience. So, whether you're reliving your childhood memories or creating new ones, the Rainbow Brite Plush Doll is sure to bring a smile to your face every single time.
