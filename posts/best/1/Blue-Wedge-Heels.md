### [Jessica Simpson Navy Blue Solid Wedge Heels](https://serp.ly/amazon/Blue+Wedge+Heels?utm\_term=jessica-simpson-navy-blue-solid-wedge-heels)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Blue+Wedge+Heels?utm_term=jessica-simpson-navy-blue-solid-wedge-heels"><img alt="jessica-simpson-cash-womens-solid-slip-on-wedge-heels-navy-baby-sleek-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/jessica-simpson-cash-womens-solid-slip-on-wedge-heels-navy-baby-sleek-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Jessica Simpson Cash round-toe wedge heels in navy blue baby color. At first, I couldn't believe how cute and stylish they looked. They made quite the statement wherever I went. But, the first thing I noticed was the cushioning on the footbed, making them a comfy choice for a long day at work or a fun night out. 

One of the most crucial factors for me when trying on shoes is the closure. In this case, I was pleased with the fit. The Jessica Simpson heels are known for their comfort and style, and this wedge was no exception. The fact that it's made of 100% synthetic material was an added bonus! 

However, I must admit that the sizing issue took me by surprise. Many reviewers mentioned that these shoes run small and narrow. I needed to go up half a size to find the perfect fit. While the overall experience was quite positive, I would recommend considering this when ordering. 

All in all, the Jessica Simpson Cash navy blue baby round-toe wedge heels were a fun addition to my wardrobe. They provided both comfort and style, but perhaps consider ordering up a size for the best possible fit, especially if you have wider feet like me! 


### [Nine West Jazzin Almond Toe Wedges - Blue - Versatile Footwear](https://serp.ly/amazon/Blue+Wedge+Heels?utm\_term=nine-west-jazzin-almond-toe-wedges-blue-versatile-footwear)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Blue+Wedge+Heels?utm_term=nine-west-jazzin-almond-toe-wedges-blue-versatile-footwear"><img alt="nine-west-jazzin-almond-toe-wedges-blue-wedge-shoes-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/nine-west-jazzin-almond-toe-wedges-blue-wedge-shoes-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try on Nine West Jazzin Almond Toe Wedges in the stunning blue color for a roundup article. First of all, the name doesn't do much justice to these sleek and elegant shoes. When I unboxed them, I was instantly captivated by the attention to detail and the high-quality materials used. The almond toe was indeed a perfect fit, and the stacked heel gave me an extra inch of height, which is just perfect for a casual night out. 

One thing I particularly liked was the combination of leather and patent detailing on the heel, adding a touch of sophistication while maintaining a comfortable, walkable heel height. The blue was an unexpected surprise as a color option, but it was a welcome one. However, I did notice that the blue leather was slightly more prone to scratches than my usual black shoes, so I'd have to be extra cautious. 

Overall, my experience with the Nine West Jazzin Almond Toe Wedges was a positive one. They were a chic and comfortable addition to my wardrobe. Just remember, these heels do run a bit snug for smaller feet, so I'd recommend ordering a slightly larger size for that perfect fit.

I was able to wear these heels to a variety of events, from formal dinners to dance parties, and they always added an extra touch of class.

### [Blue Cut-Out Wedge Heels by Sun + Stone](https://serp.ly/amazon/Blue+Wedge+Heels?utm\_term=blue-cut-out-wedge-heels-by-sun-stone)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Blue+Wedge+Heels?utm_term=blue-cut-out-wedge-heels-by-sun-stone"><img alt="sun-stone-womens-miley-microsuede-cut-out-wedges-navy-6-5-medium-bm-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sun-stone-womens-miley-microsuede-cut-out-wedges-navy-6-5-medium-bm-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who's always on the lookout for comfortable yet stylish shoes, these Sun + Stone cut-out wedges are an undeniable winner. While the navy shade might seem a bit darker in the online description, I managed to make it work by pairing it with different outfits including dresses, skirts, and even casual pants. 

One feature that I particularly appreciated is the microsuede material. It offers a lovely, versatile finish, while the cut-out design adds a unique twist to my wardrobe. The buckle closure makes it even easier to slip in and out, especially during those hectic mornings getting ready. 

There is, however, one drawback that I couldn't overlook. The rounded toe might look chic at first, but I found it to be more impractical than fashionable. After a few hours of wearing, it started to pinch and discomfort began to set in. 

The only other inconvenience was the size. As a medium (M), I found these shoes just slightly too big. While I eventually managed to break them in, the issue was noticeable at first, requiring me to swap my size up from a usual (B). 

All in all, despite the minor drawbacks, I can confidently say that these wedges have become a staple in my wardrobe, offering both comfort and a touch of class to my daily outfits.
