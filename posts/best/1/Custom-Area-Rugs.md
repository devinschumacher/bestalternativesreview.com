After the rug is completed, it is inspected for quality and any imperfections are corrected. The finished rug is then delivered to the customer, ready to be placed in their home or office.

The choice of material depends on the customer's preferences and the intended use of the rug. For example, wool is a popular choice for custom area rugs due to its durability, softness, and ability to hold intricate patterns.

The designer will work with the customer to determine the best material for their custom area rug, based on their preferences and budget.
