<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Browning+Range+Bag?utm_term=browning-black-and-gold-shell-pouch-for-molle-platform"><img alt="browning-121095897-black-and-gold-shell-pouch-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/browning-121095897-black-and-gold-shell-pouch-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to give the Browning Range Bag a try, and let me tell you, it exceeded my expectations! The water-resistant black ripstop fabric not only gives it a sleek look but also provides a touch of durability. The gold stitching adds a beautiful contrast, making it stand out even more. 

The most outstanding feature of this range bag was its flexibility. I found it very convenient to attach it to the MOLLE platform during my outdoor shooting sessions, and to be honest, it made things a lot easier when carrying my gear. The MOLLE attachment system is truly a game-changer for people who need to transport their firing hull pouch and shell box holder in an organized and hassle-free manner. 

The size is perfect, at 8.5" W x 25" H x 3" D, it accommodates my needs just right. However, I did find it a bit challenging at first to put everything in its designated compartments. It required a little bit of trial and error to figure it out, but once I got the hang of it, everything became a breeze. 

Overall, I had a great experience with the Browning Range Bag. Its stylish design, flexibility, and compact size make it a top choice for outdoor shooting enthusiasts. My only concern is the price, but considering the quality and features it offers, it seems like a fair trade-off. 


### [Browning Lona Canvas Range Bag - Carrying Pouch with Belt](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Browning+Range+Bag?utm\_term=browning-lona-canvas-range-bag-carrying-pouch-with-belt)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Browning+Range+Bag?utm_term=browning-lona-canvas-range-bag-carrying-pouch-with-belt"><img alt="browning-lona-canvas-shell-pouch-w-belt-black-brown-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/browning-lona-canvas-shell-pouch-w-belt-black-brown-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Trying this lona canvas shell pouch on, I found myself immediately impressed with the 9 oz. cotton body and the Crazy Horse leather trim. The adjustable nylon web belt with the quick release buckle felt sturdy and secure, allowing me to easily carry my shells. 

What stood out most was the zippered compartment on one side, which made it easier to empty shells without spilling them everywhere. The two internal pockets were handy to hold extra items, and the open mesh back helped keep me cool even on the hottest days. However, I noticed there were no options for carrying more than shells, making it less useful for carrying other necessary items like cleaning supplies or tools. 

Overall, this product has made my shooting experience much more comfortable and convenient, but would be worth considering the cons if you need storage for additional equipment.

Not to mention, the pockets were super convenient and easily accessible, so I could quickly grab what I needed without having to rummage through the bag. 

However, there was one minor issue I faced—the zipper had a bit of difficulty sometimes, which made it slightly challenging to open the bag when I needed it quick.
