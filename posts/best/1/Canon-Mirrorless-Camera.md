With the Canon EOS R100 Mirrorless Camera, I found myself feeling like a kid in a candy store. The camera packed a punch way beyond its size. It's small, portable, and highly versatile - almost more powerful than it appears on the surface. 

Straight out of the box, one of the most eye-catching features was the Dual Pixel CMOS AF. I didn't realize it at first, but this technology enabled the camera to lock focus on a person's eyes, improving the overall image quality a great deal. This was especially helpful when I ventured into the world of street photography. The Full HD video capability at 60 frames per second was equally impressive; it allowed me to capture everything in sharp detail. A 4K video at 24 frames per second was an added bonus that blew me away. 

However, it wasn't all smooth sailing. I struggled with the lens. I found it a little more complex than I was used to - especially the focus ring. I sometimes wished I could turn it, but it would only zoom. I had an even harder time with the pancake lens, which I used for my street photography stint. While it might have been perfect for capturing candid moments, the lens itself was quite awkward to handle. 

Despite these minor inconveniences, the Canon EOS R100 Mirrorless Camera was undoubtedly fun to use. Its compactness and portability were one of its major advantages. And it's always delightful to witness the beauty of everyday life through the lens of a camera. 

My journey with the Canon EOS R100 proved to me that this camera was the ideal companion for an adventurous soul. It's not just a tool for capturing memories and creating masterpieces; itâ€™s a tool for immersing oneself in the art of photography. It makes me believe that sometimes, the best and most enjoyable cameras are the ones that come in small, unassuming packages. This one certainly fit that category.

But the EOS M50 Mark II isn't without its flaws. The battery life can be a bit of a letdown, especially during long shooting sessions. Additionally, the lack of accessories like a memory card can make it feel like a missing piece of the puzzle.

### [Canon EOS M5 Black Mirrorless Camera with 24.2 MP](https://serp.ly/amazon/Canon+Mirrorless+Camera?utm\_term=canon-eos-m5-black-mirrorless-camera-with-24-2-mp)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Canon+Mirrorless+Camera?utm_term=canon-eos-m5-black-mirrorless-camera-with-24-2-mp"><img alt="canon-eos-m5-24-2-megapixel-mirrorless-camera-with-lens-15-mm-45-mm-black-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/canon-eos-m5-24-2-megapixel-mirrorless-camera-with-lens-15-mm-45-mm-black-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

And speaking of photographers, this little gem can definitely compete with the big guys in terms of performance. 

What really stood out to me was the camera's high-resolution 24.2-megapixel CMOS sensor, which effortlessly captured even the tiniest details in my pictures. The Fast and smooth Dual Pixel CMOS AF technology was another game-changer. It made focusing a breeze, even when trying to capture my pets in action. 

But let's not forget about the video capabilities. The Full HD 60p video feature allowed me to easily capture fast-moving subjects, like my kids playing in the park, without losing any quality. Plus, the 3.2-inch touch screen LCD monitor, which tilted up and down, made framing shots from odd angles a cinch. 

Not everything was a positive, however. The autofocus did struggle a bit in low-light situations, and I found the menu system to be a bit confusing at times. But these are minor quibbles compared to the overall fantastic experience I had with the Canon EOS M5. 

So, if you're in the market for a powerful, yet portable camera, definitely consider the Canon EOS M5. Its lightweight design and impressive features make it a worthy companion for your everyday adventures!
