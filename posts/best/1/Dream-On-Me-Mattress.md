The Dream On Me Sweet Dreams 88 Coil Spring Crib and Toddler Bed Mattress is a comfortable and durable option for little ones. I recently tried one out for my niece's crib and was impressed by the quality of the materials and the sturdy construction. The mattress features 88 interwoven, heat tempered coils that provide excellent support for my niece, making it perfect for her to sleep on comfortably.

It also has a protective waterproof cover that makes cleaning up any messes a breeze. The mattress is GREENGUARD Gold certified, ensuring a safe and healthy indoor environment for your baby. 

However, one downside I noticed was the noise the mattress made when my niece moved around. It seemed to crinkle quite loudly, and I was worried about how it might affect her sleep. Additionally, the mattress is quite firm, so it might not be the best choice for babies who prefer a softer sleeping surface. 

Overall, the Dream On Me Sweet Dreams 88 Coil Spring Crib and Toddler Bed Mattress is a solid choice for parents looking for a comfortable and supportive mattress for their little one. Just be aware of the noise it makes and the firmness of the mattress.

I recently started using the Dream on Me 3" Spring Coil Portable Crib Mattress for my baby's first nap.

The mattress is designed to fit mini and portable cribs, which I found to be perfect for our small space. 

However, I did notice a downside to this mattress. I had a hard time packing it away, especially since it has a firm and coiled construction. I also couldn't help but wonder why the plastic cover was so thin, considering how hypoallergenic it claims to be. 

Despite these minor quibbles, I must say that I've been very happy with the Dream on Me mattress. My baby seems content while sleeping on it, and it's a great option for those who want a portable, high-quality sleep surface for their little ones.

As a mom, I've always been on the lookout for safe and comfy bedding for my kiddos. The Dream on Me 2-Sided Crib and Toddler Mattress caught my eye with its dual functionality. The mattress worked perfectly for my newborn and kept his sleep cozy and warm. When he grew a bit older, I simply flipped it over and it became his toddler bed. 

One of the best features for me was the wet-proof, triple-laminated fabric cover. In real-life, this meant no more frantic middle-of-the-night washing or worry over stains. Not only did it wipe clean with warm water and mild soap but it also had a hypoallergenic, anti-bacterial waterproof cover that's anti-mold and anti-odor. Plus, it met the Federal Flammability Standard 16CFR 1632, which is a must have when it comes to baby sleep safety. 

However, there was one downside - it was quite a heavy mattress to move around. Nevertheless, its quality outweighed the small inconvenience. All in all, the Dream on Me Mattress was a dream come true for a fuss-free and safe night's sleep.

### [Twilight Dream On Me 5" Coil Crib and Toddler Bed Mattress with Waterproof, Fire Resistant Cover](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Dream+On+Me+Mattress?utm\_term=twilight-dream-on-me-5-coil-crib-and-toddler-bed-mattress-with-waterproof-fire-resistant-cover)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Dream+On+Me+Mattress?utm_term=twilight-dream-on-me-5-coil-crib-and-toddler-bed-mattress-with-waterproof-fire-resistant-cover"><img alt="dream-on-me-twilight-5-80-coil-spring-crib-and-toddler-bed-mattress-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/dream-on-me-twilight-5-80-coil-spring-crib-and-toddler-bed-mattress-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I have been using the "Dream on Me Twilight 5" 80 Coil Spring Crib and Toddler Bed Mattress" for a few weeks now, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations. As a mom, comfort is my top priority, and this mattress really delivers. 

One of the things that stand out the most is the coil support system. The 80 interwoven, heat tempered coils provide a firm foundation, giving my child the right level of support as they grow and develop. The mattress is lightweight, making it easy to move around and clean. 

The mattress also comes with two hypoallergenic layers, which offer a cushioned comfort for my baby. This feature has been a godsend, as my little one has always struggled with finding a comfortable mattress. The material is breathable and perfect for sensitive skin, which is another pro in my book. 

The mattress also has an airflow pocket that helps keep it fresh, preventing any foul smell. This is a big plus because I hate the smell of dirty mattresses. The antibacterial, waterproof lock stitched binding is an added bonus, as it helps prevent mold, mildew, and odor from seeping inside. 

However, there are a few cons that I want to mention. First, the mattress is a bit thin, which I found out after my son kept sinking into it. Second, it doesn't fit perfectly in the crib, which makes it a bit challenging to secure. Lastly, the mattress arrived without any plastic covering it, which made me worried about the quality of the product. 

Overall, I would say that the "Dream on Me Twilight 5" 80 Coil Spring Crib and Toddler Bed Mattress" is a great option for parents looking for a comfortable, durable, and affordable mattress for their little ones. The coil support system and hypoallergenic layers make it a firm favorite, but just be aware of the size and thickness issues.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Dream+On+Me+Mattress?utm_term=ultimate-dream-on-me-6-inch-coil-mattress-for-crib-and-toddler-bed"><img alt="dream-on-me-112-superior-slumber-6-in-spring-coil-crib-and-toddler-bed-mattress-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/dream-on-me-112-superior-slumber-6-in-spring-coil-crib-and-toddler-bed-mattress-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've had this mattress for a few months now, and it has stood up to the test of time. It has provided a comfortable, supportive sleeping environment for my little one. One of the most impressive features of this mattress is its durability. Despite being lightweight, it doesn't show any signs of wear and tear. The steel coils are designed to provide supreme comfort and support, and it's done just that. 

However, there was one downside. While the mattress is firm, it wasn't the most comfortable for my three-year-old. He much preferred my king-size pillow top mattress, which offered a little more comfort. It might be more appropriate for infants rather than toddlers. 

All in all, I'm pleased with the Dream On Me 112 Superior Slumber 6-in Spring Coil Crib and Toddler Bed Mattress. It's a well-constructed, durable, and comfortable choice for a baby or toddler's bed. But, I would recommend it for infants instead of toddlers due to its firmness.

### Do you need a mattress protector with Dream On Me Mattress?

It is always recommended to use a mattress protector, regardless of the brand or type of mattress you choose. Dream On Me mattresses are no exception. Mattress protectors serve as a barrier, keeping spills, dust, and allergens from directly interacting with the mattress surface. This not only extends the life of the mattress but also provides a more hygienic and allergen-free sleeping environment. 

Many Dream On Me mattresses come with a removable cover that can be washed to help maintain cleanliness, so the need for an additional mattress protector may vary depending on your preferences. It's best to refer to the specific mattress model's product description for any specific protector requirements. 


### How can I assess the comfort level and support of a Dream On Me Mattress?

When assessing the comfort level and support of a Dream On Me Mattress, consider factors such as firmness, material, and overall construction. It is essential to try out the mattress before purchasing, if possible. Many showrooms and retailers have test mattresses available for customers to try. Alternatively, you can read customer reviews and ratings, as they may provide a more realistic assessment of a product's comfort and support. 

For memory foam and hybrid mattresses, look for a balance of firmness and softness. The comfort layer should feel comfortable and supportive, while the base should be firm enough to offer proper stability. Innerspring, latex, and air mattresses may feel differently due to their unique constructions, so it's crucial to try one out for yourself to get a feeling for the level of support that best suits your sleeping preferences.
