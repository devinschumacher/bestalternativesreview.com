### [Threshold Sleek Black Velvet Dining Chair](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Black+Velvet+Dining+Chairs?utm\_term=threshold-sleek-black-velvet-dining-chair)

One feature that stood out to me is the foam-filled padded seat and comfortably curved backrest, making it a truly inviting chair. However, the wooden legs seem to wobble a bit, which can be a bit concerning, especially when you're trying to enjoy a meal with your family. 

Another thing that surprised me was the ease of assembly, as I was able to put the chair together without any fuss, but I have noticed that the screws tend to become loose over time. 

The main downside I've experienced is a lack of durability; the velvet fabric appears to attract lint, and I've noticed it wear down faster than expected. This is not the best fit for someone who likes to keep their furniture around for a long time. 

Overall, the Geller Modern Dining Chair has its pros and cons, and I believe it's a matter of personal preference and need. If you're looking for a stylish, comfortable chair, this one might fit the bill, but if you're after something more durable, I would recommend looking elsewhere.

### Are the chairs upholstered in genuine velvet fabric?

To ensure the longevity of black velvet upholstery on your dining chairs, proper care and maintenance are essential. Regularly vacuum or brush the chair to remove any dust, dirt, or debris from the fabric. It is also crucial to protect the velvet from spills and other potential stains by applying a stain guard or fabric protectant treatment to the upholstery. 

When it comes to cleaning spills, it is best to consult the manufacturer's instructions, as some velvet fabrics may require specialized cleaning methods. In general, using a gentle, non-abrasive cleaner and blotting the affected area with a clean, damp cloth is recommended.
