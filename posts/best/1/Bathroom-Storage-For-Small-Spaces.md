I recently had the chance to try out the RiverRidge Home Ellsworth Two-Door Floor Cabinet with Open Shelf. As soon as I received it, I was impressed by its traditional shutter door design and polished silver knobs. It was perfect for creating a clean and organized space for my bathroom essentials. 

One of the features that stands out to me is the adjustable anchor brackets, which provide added stability to the cabinet. The adjustable shelves made organizing my bathroom items a breeze, and I loved the versatility of the storage options it offered. The open and top shelves were great for displaying decorative items, while the closed doors allowed me to keep toiletries and other clutter hidden away. 

However, there were a few drawbacks to my experience. The instruction manual wasn't the best, and I had to figure out some parts on my own. I was also a bit disappointed when I noticed a couple of chips in the paint upon arrival. 

Overall, I would say this cabinet is well-made, attractive, and easy to assemble, making it a great addition to any bathroom or small space. With the right instructions and a bit of extra care, this cabinet can definitely bring function and style to your home.

## Buyer's Guide

When it comes to [bathroom storage for small spaces](https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativesreview.com/blob/main/posts/best/1/Bathroom-Storage-For-Small-Spaces.md), finding the right solution can be a challenge. However, with the right features and considerations in mind, you can make the most of your limited space. In this section, we will discuss key aspects to look for in bathroom storage solutions for small spaces, as well as general advice on how to choose the best products for your needs. 


### Foldable Storage

Foldable storage units are an excellent choice for small bathrooms, as they can be easily folded away when not in use. Look for options that have adjustable shelves or compartments to accommodate various storage needs. Additionally, consider the sturdiness of the folding mechanism to ensure it won't collapse when fully loaded. 


### Vertical Design

Vertical storage solutions are ideal for bathrooms with limited floor space. Wall-mounted cabinets and shelves can help maximize storage while maintaining a minimal footprint. When selecting vertical storage, look for options with ample shelving or multiple compartments to organize your essentials efficiently. 


### Space-Saving Materials

Selecting storage solutions made from lightweight and space-saving materials, such as plastic or bamboo, can make a significant difference in small bathrooms. These materials often require less space and are easier to maneuver in tight areas. Be sure to choose materials that are durable and water-resistant to ensure the long-term performance of your bathroom storage. 


### Multi-Purpose Storage

Combining multiple storage functions in one unit can be an excellent way to save space in a small bathroom. Look for storage solutions that offer pull-out trays, built-in organizers, or even built-in hooks or racks for hanging items. By choosing a multi-purpose storage solution, you can store more items in a small space while keeping everything well-organized. 


## FAQ


### What types of bathroom storage solutions are available for small spaces?

Several types of bathroom storage solutions are available for small spaces, including over-the-toilet storage, corner shelves, wall-mounted cabinets, and hanging organizers. Additionally, you can consider under-sink storage, floating shelves, and stackable drawers to make the most of your limited space. 

Over-the-toilet storage options often come with built-in medicine cabinets, which can be used to store essentials like toothbrushes and dental floss. Corner shelves can be installed in unused corners to maximize space, while wall-mounted cabinets and hanging organizers can be customized to fit your specific needs. 


### What is the best material for bathroom storage in small spaces?

When choosing storage solutions for a small bathroom, it is essential to consider materials that are moisture-resistant, durable, and easy to clean. Most bathroom storage products are made of materials such as wood, plastic, or metal. While wooden products can add a touch of elegance, they may not withstand moisture well, and they require regular maintenance. Plastic and metal products are more suitable for small bathrooms, as they are resistant to moisture, easy to clean, and have a longer lifespan. 

Metal storage products often come with a sleek and modern look, making them ideal for small spaces. However, they can be more expensive than plastic options. On the other hand, plastic storage products are often more affordable and can come in a variety of colors and designs to match your bathroom decor. But, they may not be as sturdy or durable as metal or wooden options. 


### How can I organize my small bathroom effectively?

Effective organization of a small bathroom can be achieved by considering the following tips: 
1) Place frequently used items within easy reach, such as toothbrushes and toothpaste near the sink, and make-up near the mirror. 2) Use multi-functional products, like a soap dispenser with a built-in toothbrush holder, or a vanity with built-in storage compartments. 

3) Install adjustable shelves or a hanging organizer to store extra towels and toiletries. 4) Use under-sink storage solutions, such as slide-out trays or drawers, to keep essentials hidden and clutter-free. 5) Consider using a freestanding storage unit or a cart with wheels to maximize storage space without occupying much floor space. 6) Use vertical space effectively by installing hooks or racks for hanging towels or rolling up bath mats. 


### How do I choose the right size of bathroom storage for small spaces?

When selecting bathroom storage for small spaces, it is essential to choose the appropriate size to maximize space and function efficiently. Measure the available space in your bathroom before making a purchase. Be sure to account for any doors, windows, or other obstacles that may affect the placement of the storage unit. 

Ideally, you should choose a storage solution that is no larger than the available space but is large enough to accommodate your needs. For instance, a wall-mounted cabinet with adjustable shelves can be a great option, as it can be customized to fit the available space and can be moved as needed if your storage requirements change over time. 


### Can I customize bathroom storage solutions for small spaces?

Yes, many bathroom storage solutions for small spaces can be customized to fit your specific needs. For instance, wall-mounted cabinets and shelving units often come with adjustable shelves and mounting brackets, allowing you to choose the optimal position for each shelf based on the available space and the items you wish to store. 

In addition, many hanging organizers and shower caddies come with multiple hooks or shelves that can be rearranged to accommodate different items. If you have a unique storage requirement, you may even be able to consult with a manufacturer to create a custom-made storage solution. Be sure to consider the durability, moisture resistance, and ease of cleaning when customizing your bathroom storage. 


### Are there any eco-friendly options for bathroom storage in small spaces?

Yes, eco-friendly options for bathroom storage in small spaces are available. Look for products made from sustainable materials such as reclaimed wood, bamboo, or recycled plastic. Many manufacturers offer storage solutions made with FSC-certified wood, ensuring that the wood comes from responsibly managed forests. 

For instance, there are eco-friendly under-sink storage solutions made from recycled plastic, which can help minimize your environmental impact while still providing functional storage space. Additionally, you can consider using natural materials, such as woven baskets or wooden boxes, to store your bathroom essentials in a sustainable and aesthetically pleasing way.
