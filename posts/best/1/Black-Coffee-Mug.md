<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Black+Coffee+Mug?utm_term=elegant-xl-black-coffee-mug-with-wooden-handle"><img alt="xl-black-wooden-handle-mug-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/xl-black-wooden-handle-mug-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Organic Black Coffee Mug by Santa Barbara Design Studio](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Black+Coffee+Mug?utm\_term=organic-black-coffee-mug-by-santa-barbara-design-studio)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Black+Coffee+Mug?utm_term=organic-black-coffee-mug-by-santa-barbara-design-studio"><img alt="organic-mug-matte-black-glossy-black-by-santa-barbara-design-studio-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/organic-mug-matte-black-glossy-black-by-santa-barbara-design-studio-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Organic Mug from Santa Barbara Design Studio has been a fantastic addition to my daily routine. Its sleek matte black and glossy black design adds a touch of elegance to my morning cup of coffee. The oversized handle provides a comfortable grip that I love, making me enjoy my sips more.

### [Threshold 18.5oz Black Ribbed Coffee Mug](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Black+Coffee+Mug?utm\_term=threshold-18-5oz-black-ribbed-coffee-mug)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Black+Coffee+Mug?utm_term=threshold-18-5oz-black-ribbed-coffee-mug"><img alt="18-5oz-glass-ribbed-mug-black-threshold-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/18-5oz-glass-ribbed-mug-black-threshold-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently made the switch from traditional ceramic mugs and added the 18.5-oz Glass Ribbed Mug to my collection. The sleek and stylish design caught my eye, plus it's versatile for both hot and cold beverages. One of the standout features is that it's both microwave and dishwasher safe, making reheating or cleaning a breeze. 

However, there were a few drawbacks to this mug. The first and most frustrating issue is that the glass is incredibly fragile. One bump against the countertop and the mug shattered into pieces. This issue could be addressed by improving the durability of the mug. 

In addition to being fragile, the design of the handle caused some discomfort. The handle was not ergonomically designed, which made gripping the mug difficult and sometimes unpleasant during use. 

Despite its weaknesses, the Glass Ribbed Mug maintains an attractive appearance both inside and out. I was quite disappointed with its construction, but hopefully Target will address these issues and produce a more durable version in the future.

Its functionality is just as impressive, as it works perfectly for both hot and cold beverages. The microwave- and dishwasher-safe design makes it convenient for everyday use. 

However, I noticed it's quite susceptible to scratches, and it might not be the best to stack these mugs together, especially in your top shelf. [Despite this minor inconvenience, I appreciate the aesthetics and the sturdiness of this mug, making it an essential part of my morning routine.](https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativereviews.com//blob/main/posts/best/2/Funny-Mugs.md)

The unique shape of the handle made it comfortable to hold, and the double-wall construction kept the exterior cool to the touch. I found the black color appealing, and it added a modern touch to my home decor. 

As for the capacity, I was initially skeptical about the 12-oz size. However, after a few weeks of using the mug, I came to appreciate its generous size when I wanted a full cup of coffee in the morning. The ceramic and copper material also provided insulation, keeping my coffee heated for a satisfactorily long period. 

One downside I encountered was the lack of a handle on the mug. While it lent a minimalist look, it was somewhat inconvenient for holding, especially when carrying the mug with one hand. Additionally, I noticed a slight unevenness at the base of the mug, which did not affect its functionality but was noticeable. 

In conclusion, the Fellow Big Jo'Mug is a beautiful and functional coffee mug. Its double-wall insulation and polished finish make it a pleasure to use, even if the lack of a handle poses some challenges. I would happily recommend this mug to others seeking a stylish and reliable coffee companion.

I recently tried the Ember Mug 2, and it's been a game-changer in my daily coffee routine. The smart mug features a sleek black design that looks great in any office or home setting. The real star of the show, though, is its temperature control feature. With the Ember app, I can set the exact drinking temperature I want, and the mug will maintain it for up to 1.5 hours. 

Not only does it keep my coffee perfectly hot, but it also looks after my health by reminding me when to hydrate. The mug is IPX7 rated, which means it's fully submersible in water up to 1 meter deep, making it easy to clean by hand. The included charging coaster, adapter, and quick start guide were thoughtful additions. 

Although the mug is well-made and attractive, I did encounter a few issues. Firstly, I found the temperature regulation can be inconsistent at times, which didn't make for an ideal drinking experience. Additionally, I've experienced a bit of an unpleasant aftertaste when using the mug for tea. While not a major concern, it is something to bear in mind. 

Overall, the Ember Mug 2 has plenty of positives and a few negative points. If you're looking for a mug that will keep your coffee just the way you like it, this could be the one for you. Just be prepared for the occasional temperature regulation hiccup and the potential for an aftertaste with certain beverages.
