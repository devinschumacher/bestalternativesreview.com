However, the lack of protection for reverse polarity when swapping batteries didn't sit well with us and could be an area for improvement. 

Although the device wasn't waterproof, we appreciated its ability to charge up to four 12-volt batteries at once. The charger's robust construction also assured us that we were safe from overheating, which was a big concern when juicing up multiple batteries. We'd have liked to see a faster shipping option from the seller, but the high rating and positive reviews from other users suggest that this little Battery Buddy is a handy tool worth the wait.
