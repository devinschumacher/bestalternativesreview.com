I recently had the chance to try out the EIGShow Premium Makeup [Brush Set](https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativesreview.com/blob/main/posts/best/1/Brush-Set.md), and let me tell you, these brushes have made a world of a difference in my makeup routine!

Not only did they help my foundation and concealer glide on smoothly, but they also made blending my eye shadows and face kabuki brush a breeze. I appreciated that they didn't shed or require constant brushing, and the fact that they're vegan and cruelty-free made me feel extra good about my purchase! 

The brush set also came with a convenient brush roll, which made it easy to carry and store all of them in one place. [While I may not use all the brushes in this set, this Essential Brush Set has become my go-to when I want a quick and hassle-free makeup routine, and I highly recommend it as a practical gift for friends and family.](https://gist.github.com/janeknowsbest77/aa5bac590ee24948dffcc032795fb46a)

But what really set this set apart was the case. It kept my brushes organized, and the added brush cleaner and guide made cleaning them a snap. Plus, it was the perfect size for traveling. 

However, the only downside was the price. I would have loved to see a more affordable option for those who are just starting out with makeup brushes.

The handle, made of aluminum and wood, adds a luxurious touch to the overall experience. 

While the Matto Makeup Brush Set has its pros, such as being cruelty-free and offering a wide range of brushes for every makeup need, there were a few cons I encountered.

### Types of Brush Sets

Before you start your search for the perfect brush set, it's essential to understand the different types of brush sets available. Some common ones include: makeup brush sets, nail art brush sets, and fine art brush sets. By identifying which type you need, you can narrow down your search and make the process more manageable. 


### Materials

The materials used to make the brushes in a set will greatly impact their performance and durability. Some common materials include natural hair, synthetic fibers, and a combination of both. Natural hair brushes are often softer and more luxurious, while synthetic brushes offer more versatility and are more durable. Make sure to consider the benefits of each material when selecting your perfect brush set. 


### Size and Shape

The size and shape of the brushes in a set play a crucial role in their functionality. Different brush shapes are designed for specific purposes, such as eyeshadow, foundation, and concealer.

Ensure your brush set includes a variety of sizes and shapes to cover all your makeup needs.

When it comes to buying a brush set, it's essential to remember that the best ones are not always the most expensive. Consider the quality and consistency of the brushes, as well as any additional features such as antibacterial properties or magnetic holders.

## FAQ


### What is a brush set?

A brush set is a collection of different types of brushes, usually designed for specific tasks like applying makeup, brushing hair, or cleaning surfaces. These brush sets often come in various shapes, sizes, and materials, providing a complete set for all your grooming and styling needs. They make excellent gifts or for those starting their beauty or grooming journey. 

The brushes in the set may include foundation brushes, concealer brushes, blush brushes, eyeshadow brushes, eyeliner brushes, lip brushes, or even exfoliating or massage brushes. By having a diverse range of brushes, you can achieve a variety of desired looks, from everyday makeup to more glamorous party looks or even just clean, smooth skin. 


### Why would I need multiple brushes in a set?

Using the right brush for each job can make a big difference in the quality and longevity of your makeup, and the outcome you achieve. For instance, using a specific brush for your foundation can provide better coverage and a more flawless finish than attempting to apply it with a different brush. Each brush type serves a unique purpose and can give better results when used for the task it's intended for. 

In addition, having a variety of brushes allows you to create different makeup looks and styles. If you're interested in experimenting with different makeup trends or even creating a unique daily look, a brush set full of various shapes and sizes can offer you the versatility you need. Not only does it save you money, but it also saves time in trying to find the perfect brush for each job. 


### How do I choose the right brush set for me?

Choosing the right brush set depends on your specific needs and preferences. For example, if you're into makeup, you might want to look for a set that includes a mix of foundation, concealer, and blush brushes. If you have a preference for certain materials like synthetic or natural bristles, you would want to make sure the set has those options available. 

It could also be helpful to think about the styles of makeup you typically wear or the tasks you need the brushes for. If you're someone who likes to experiment with a variety of makeup looks, you might want a set with a diverse range of shapes and sizes. On the other hand, if you have specific tasks you need the brushes for, you should focus on sets that cater to those specific needs. Ultimately, the right brush set for you depends on your unique needs and preferences. 


### Are there any downsides to buying a brush set?

One potential downside to buying a brush set could be the cost. While individual brushes can be expensive, a full set might be even more so. Depending on your budget, this could be a factor to consider. However, if you find a set of high-quality brushes at a good price, it might be worth the investment. 

Another consideration could be storage space. Brush sets can take up significant counter or drawer space, so if you have limited room, you might want to consider how the size of the set would impact your available storage. You might also want to think about how you would store the brushes in a set to prevent damage and ensure they stay clean and hygienic. 


### How do I maintain my brush set?

Taking good care of your brush set is essential for the longevity of the brushes and for your skin's health. Remember to clean your brushes regularly, following the manufacturer's instructions, to prevent the buildup of bacteria or makeup. Additionally, storing your brushes properly is important to prevent damage. You might consider using a brush holder or organizer to keep your brushes in good condition and prevent them from becoming misshapen. Keeping your brushes clean and properly stored will also help extend their lifespan. 

A good rule of thumb is to clean your brushes monthly, or more often if they're frequently used. Regular cleaning not only helps keep your brushes in good shape but also helps to ensure the safety of your skin by removing any buildup of product or bacteria. Take the time to invest in a proper brush care routine to maintain the quality and longevity of your brush set. 


### What are the benefits of owning a brush set?

There are many benefits to owning a brush set. One major advantage is the versatility it provides. A set with a diverse range of brushes allows you to create a wide variety of makeup looks and styles with ease. It saves you time and money in having to purchase individual brushes for each job. A good quality set of brushes can also last for many years, providing you with a long-term investment. 

Another benefit is the quality of application it provides. Using the right brush for each job can make a significant difference in the outcome of your makeup. Brushes specifically designed for certain tasks can provide a more flawless finish and better coverage, leading to a more polished and professional look. This is especially important if you're using high-end makeup products, where the application can make or break the final result.
