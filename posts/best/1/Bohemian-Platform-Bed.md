I had the pleasure of using the Baxton Studio Cielle Platform Bed Frame in my home and I must say, it was a game-changer! Crafted from rubberwood, MDF wood, and LVL, I was immediately impressed with the quality of the frame. The low platform made it incredibly inviting, and the turned legs added a charming touch of old-world charm. I also didn't need a box spring, which was a refreshing change. 

As for the assembly, it was a bit of a challenge, but I managed to put it together with some help. I couldn't help but notice the directions felt a bit lacking and the parts were not clearly labeled, but we eventually figured it out. Despite this, the bed frame felt sturdy and well made, which was a relief. 

One downside, however, was the gap between the headboard and the mattress, which was a bit surprising since I ordered a king size bed. It made me think twice about the manufacturer's measurements. 

In the end, I was overall satisfied with the Baxton Studio Cielle Platform Bed Frame. It added a touch of beauty and elegance to my bedroom, and the warmth and inviting atmosphere it created were invaluable. While assembly was a bit of a hassle, the finished product made it all worth it.
