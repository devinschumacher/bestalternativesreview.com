A few weeks ago, I stumbled upon IGBBLOVE's Dora Explorer Soft Plush Backpack at our local store and decided to get it for my little one. The moment she saw the adorable purple design, she was ecstatic! The backpack is super lightweight, making it easy for her to carry around.

One of the best features of this backpack is the included Dora's explorer map, made of vinal material that is easy to wipe clean. My daughter loves reading it and looking at all the adventures Dora has embarked on. The backpack has a perfect size for a child her age, and the inside pocket is just the right size for keeping snacks, water bottles, and small toys organized. 

However, I did notice that the color may vary slightly due to different camera or screen display. Additionally, this backpack might be a better fit for children aged 3 to 5 years old, so it may not fit older kids quite as well as we would like.
