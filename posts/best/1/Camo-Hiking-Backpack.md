I recently had the chance to try out The North Face Berkeley Field Bag, and I have to say, it's been a mixed experience. First off, the adjustable straps make it really comfortable to wear, which is a huge plus for me. The zippered compartments are super helpful for storing all my essentials, and they stay organized and secure throughout the day. 

However, there are a few things I'd like to see improved. The front crinkle nylon fabric has a bit of texture to it, but it also feels a bit rough and uncomfortable against my skin. As for the fleece-lined exterior pocket, while it's a nice touch, it's not large enough to accommodate much. 

Overall, I'd give the Berkeley Field Bag a solid 4 out of 5. It has a lot of great features, but there's still a bit of room for improvement in terms of comfort and functionality.
