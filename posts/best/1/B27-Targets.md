Ever since I started using Thompson Target's B27-Shield Defense Training targets, my shooting experience has become a whole lot better. The best part? I'm contributing a little less to the waste bin by using a more reasonably sized target sheet. 

The B27-Shield's design is an innovative step forward in defense training. It perfectly blends the traditional B27 scoring area with the 19x25 inch target sheet, a move that's not only eco-friendly but also practical. 

I love the additional bulls; they lengthen the life of the target. Plus, the bright red 1-inch bullseye aim points are like a beacon for the shot placement. And who says you can't be precise when it comes to your aim? The subtle 1-inch grid makes for accurate sight adjustments. 

Printed on heavy bright white paper with high density ultra bright inks, these targets are as clear and vivid as they can get. It's like having your very own shooting range at home! 

These targets have definitely upped the game in my practice sessions. I wouldn't mind sharing this experience with other enthusiasts. Maybe it could make a difference for them too!

As someone who recently tried using the Action Target B-27NCJA-100 Tgt B27ncja 100Pk targets in a shooting range, I found them to be quite effective and user-friendly. The color-shaded scoring rings made it much easier to gauge my progress compared to traditional targets. However, the one downside was that it felt a bit heavy at 13.5 oz, but overall, it balanced out the accuracy these targets offered. 

I'd definitely recommend these for anyone looking for a more efficient and effective target shooting experience. 


### [High Contrast B27 Silhouette Target Set](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/B27+Targets?utm\_term=high-contrast-b27-silhouette-target-set)

I recently tried a 23" x 35" B27 Silhouette Target from Pro-Shot, and let me tell you, it's a game-changer for my shooting sessions. The high contrast blue silhouette really stands out, making it easy for me to focus on hitting the target without any fuzziness. I appreciate the scoring table for recording hits and values – it's a thoughtful addition. 

I was surprised by the brilliant white paper this target is printed on, which makes the silhouette even more visible. The convenience of having the score card printed directly on the target is fantastic – no more struggling to keep track of scores. 

One downside I noticed is that the scoring table is not as intuitive as I'd like, but it's still usable. My only other complaint is that the folded and packaged target comes in a zip-top bag, which makes it harder to keep the target neat on the shooting range. Overall, despite the minor drawbacks, I'm quite impressed with this B27 Silhouette Target from Pro-Shot, especially considering it's made in the USA.
