### [Continental ExtremeContact DWS06 Plus: All-Season, High-Performance Tire with Exceptional Tread Life](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dwx726?utm\_term=continental-extremecontact-dws06-plus-all-season-high-performance-tire-with-exceptional-tread-life)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dwx726?utm_term=continental-extremecontact-dws06-plus-all-season-high-performance-tire-with-exceptional-tread-life"><img alt="continental-extremecontact-dws06-plus-255-45zr18-103y-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/continental-extremecontact-dws06-plus-255-45zr18-103y-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried the Continental ExtremeContact DWS06 Plus 255/45ZR18 103Y, and it was quite an experience. Right off the bat, I was impressed by its unique and stylish design. However, when trying it out on the road, I found its performance a bit lacking - the dry handling was not as smooth as I had hoped, and it had a tendency to hydroplane in wet conditions. 

The highlights of the product, such as improved dry and wet braking, and enhanced dry and wet handling, did not seem to match my experience. But, on the bright side, the tire's snow performance was quite impressive, despite it not being a dedicated snow tire. 

One drawback I noticed was the road noise - something that even the most enthusiastic driver might find unpleasant. However, tire life seemed to be on the higher end compared to other similar tires. 

Overall, I felt that the Continental ExtremeContact DWS06 Plus had its highs and lows, making it a bit of a mixed bag. If you're looking for a tire that delivers on both style and performance, this could be a suitable choice. But, if tire life and noise are major concerns for you, it might be worth considering other alternatives.

### [DEWALT DCS577B FLEXVOLT 60V Max Worm Drive Style Saw: Powerful, Durable, and Efficient Carbide-Tipped Blade](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dwx726?utm\_term=dewalt-dcs577b-flexvolt-60v-max-worm-drive-style-saw-powerful-durable-and-efficient-carbide-tipped-blade)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dwx726?utm_term=dewalt-dcs577b-flexvolt-60v-max-worm-drive-style-saw-powerful-durable-and-efficient-carbide-tipped-blade"><img alt="dewalt-dcs577b-flexvolt-60v-max-7-1-4-worm-drive-style-saw-tool-only-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/dewalt-dcs577b-flexvolt-60v-max-7-1-4-worm-drive-style-saw-tool-only-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried the DeWalt DCS577B FLEXVOLT 60V Max 7-1/4" Worm Drive Style Saw in my carpentry projects, and let me tell you, it was a game-changer! Unlike other cordless saws, this one has the blade on the left and the handle at the rear, making it easier for me to see the cutting line. I'm used to the saws with the blade on the right, but being a righty, this one was comfortable right off the bat. 

The electronic brake on this baby is a true lifesaver - it helps me stop the blade instantly after the trigger is released. It's as if the saw knows when I need that extra safety feature. The bevel capacity of 53 degrees with stops at 45 and 22.5 degrees made cutting at different angles a breeze. 

One thing that really impressed me was the durability and efficiency of this saw. Its high-grade magnesium shoe and brushless motor ensure smooth, accurate cuts while also delivering a long runtime. I'm used to dealing with dust and mess on my projects, but the dust blower and port on this saw were more than helpful in keeping my workspace clean. 

However, there were a couple of cons I noticed. First, the saw is quite heavy compared to the corded ones I'm used to. But it's nothing a well-balanced grip can't handle. The second con is a concern for battery life and charging. I had issues initially with the included charger, but I managed to get it sorted out in the end. 

Overall, I'd definitely recommend the DeWalt DCS577B FLEXVOLT 60V Max 7-1/4" Worm Drive Style Saw for any carpenter or DIY enthusiast. It's powerful, safe, and incredibly efficient, making it a worthy investment in your toolbox.
