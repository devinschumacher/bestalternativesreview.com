<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Bicycle+Art?utm_term=enchanting-bicycle-themed-wall-art-pair-by-kate-and-laurel"><img alt="kate-and-laurel-sylvie-bicycle-framed-canvas-wall-art-by-simon-te-of-tai-prints-set-of-2-23x33-black-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/kate-and-laurel-sylvie-bicycle-framed-canvas-wall-art-by-simon-te-of-tai-prints-set-of-2-23x33-black-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently added these adorable Bicycle Framed Canvas Wall Arts by Simon Te of Tai Prints to my living room, and I'm absolutely in love with them. The whimsical bicycle design is just the perfect touch of playfulness for the space, and the sleek modern frame adds a touch of sophistication. 

What really stood out for me is that these pieces are locally framed in Waunakee, Wisconsin, which adds a nice personal touch. Plus, they're easy to hang with the pre-attached hangers, making them a breeze to install. 

However, I do wish there was a little more depth to the frames because they seem a bit flat against the wall. But overall, these Bicycle Framed Canvas Wall Arts are a charming addition to any room, and they certainly spark conversations among guests. 


### [Vintage Bicycle Canvas Wall Art: Elegant Green Design](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Bicycle+Art?utm\_term=vintage-bicycle-canvas-wall-art-elegant-green-design)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Bicycle+Art?utm_term=vintage-bicycle-canvas-wall-art-elegant-green-design"><img alt="olive-outing-vintage-bicycle-bicycle-canvas-wall-art-design-art-size-20-h-x-12-w-x-1-d-format-gold-s-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/olive-outing-vintage-bicycle-bicycle-canvas-wall-art-design-art-size-20-h-x-12-w-x-1-d-format-gold-s-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

A few weeks ago, I stumbled upon this stunning Olive Outing Vintage Bicycle in my favorite home decor store. It was love at first sight - the bright green bicycle painted against the contrasting dark background stood out like a beacon of retro charm. I thought it would make a fantastic conversation starter in my living room, and it did not disappoint. 

The moment I unpacked it, I was impressed by the high-quality cotton canvas wrapped around the wooden frame. It felt sturdy and sleek, with a crisp, borderless appearance. I loved the fact that it arrived ready to hang, making installation a breeze. 

One of the things that stood out to me the most was the frame thickness and width. At 1 inch, it felt substantial yet understated, perfectly framing the vintage bicycle design. I also appreciated the easy-to-hang function, as it saved me the hassle of fussing with hardware and tools. 

However, the only downside I felt was the lack of variety in framing options. While I adore the floater-framed design, I wish there were more choices to choose from, such as a simple wooden frame or a more ornate one. 

Overall, the Olive Outing Vintage Bicycle canvas wall art is a beautiful addition to my home, blending modern and contemporary design elements seamlessly. It has become the focal point of my living room, and every time I look at it, I'm reminded of the joy of owning something that's both aesthetically pleasing and functional.
