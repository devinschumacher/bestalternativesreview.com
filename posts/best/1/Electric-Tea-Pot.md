I recently gave the Vianté Hot Tea Maker a try, and let me tell you, it's not your average kettle. This beautifully designed electric glass tea kettle from Italy not only looks the part, but it also delivers in terms of functionality. 

One of my favorite features is the ability to dial in exact temperatures for different types of tea and coffee. As a tea enthusiast, this allowed me to truly savor each sip. The kettle is versatile too - I used it for steeping large amounts of loose leaf or bagged tea, and even for heating water for French press, pour-overs, and food prep. 

The kettle's bespoke brewing settings for white, green, oolong, and black teas are a game changer. With the 30-minute Keep Warm function, you can take your time sipping your freshly brewed tea without worrying about it going cold. 

However, like all products, it's not without its drawbacks. The kettle is made of 304 stainless steel, borosilicate glass, and BPA-free plastic, which I appreciate. But it does require regular washing and emptying to guard against scaling and corrosion. Overall, the Vianté Hot Tea Maker offers a luxurious tea-drinking experience, but it does come with a bit of maintenance.

The cordless convenience also made it a breeze to use, as I could serve guests in another room without having to unplug the kettle.

However, this wasn't a significant concern compared to the overall experience. While using the kettle, I found it incredibly easy to handle, thanks to the stay-cool handle. The boiling process was quite fast, and the internal temperature control provided added safety by shutting off the kettle automatically once water reached boiling point.
