### [Modern LED Resin Animal Mouse Desk Lamp](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Animal+Lamp?utm\_term=modern-led-resin-animal-mouse-desk-lamp)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Animal+Lamp?utm_term=modern-led-resin-animal-mouse-desk-lamp"><img alt="nordiem-modern-cute-led-resin-animal-rat-desk-lights-art-mouse-childrens-bedside-gift-table-lamp-sma-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/nordiem-modern-cute-led-resin-animal-rat-desk-lights-art-mouse-childrens-bedside-gift-table-lamp-sma-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

NorDiem's Modern Cute LED Resin Animal Rat Desk Lights are the perfect addition to any work or play area. The small, adorable shapes of mice in different poses come in three color options: white, gold, and black. 

As a reviewer, I found the mouse lamp easy to use with a simple on/off switch on the power cord, making it convenient without needing to get up and flip a wall switch. The lights are also made of resin, giving them a unique and sturdy feel. The different sizes of the mice add a whimsical touch to any space, and their small size means they won't take up much room on a desk or side table. 

These charming desk lamps are a great choice for both children and adults, and they make a perfect gift. However, the LED brightness might not be enough for some users, and the resin could be a bit fragile if mishandled. 

All in all, the NorDiem Animal Rat Desk Lights are a delightful addition to any room and are worth considering for their cute design and functionality. 


### [Cute Walnut Wood Animal Lamp: Stylish and Customizable](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Animal+Lamp?utm\_term=cute-walnut-wood-animal-lamp-stylish-and-customizable)

Last weekend, I received the HROOME Dog Table Lamp in the mail. My kids were beyond excited to use it in their room! As a busy mom, I loved how it lit up the space without being too intrusive. The lamp has a touch sensor that dims the light as my kids get ready for bed, which is perfect for their nighttime routine. 

One of the key features of this lamp is its wooden design, which adds a warm, homely touch to any room. The solid wood construction and high-quality white UL-listed cable cord make it a reliable investment. It's also eco-friendly, as it uses less electricity than traditional lamps. 

However, there are a couple of drawbacks. First, assembly can be a bit tricky, and it's recommended that an adult or a child with adult assistance completes the process. Also, the lamp isn't waterproof, so it's best to keep it away from water sources. 

All in all, I give the HROOME Dog Table Lamp a solid 4 out of 5 stars. It's an adorable and functional addition to any bedroom, and my kids absolutely love it!
