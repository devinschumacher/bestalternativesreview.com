### [Alphacool Core Ocean T38 All-in-One Cooler](https://serp.ly/amazon/Alpha+Cooler?utm\_term=alphacool-core-ocean-t38-all-in-one-cooler)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Alpha+Cooler?utm_term=alphacool-core-ocean-t38-all-in-one-cooler"><img alt="alphacool-core-ocean-t38-aio-280mm-13054" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alphacool-core-ocean-t38-aio-280mm-13054/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Experiencing the Alphacool Core Ocean T38 AIO 280mm was an interesting journey. I installed it on my gaming PC, and it was pretty straightforward with the provided mounting kit. The product's sleek design and ARGB lighting made it visually appealing and added a touch of style to my build. 

One of the highlights I noticed was the aluminum radiator, which had additional cooling channels, allowing for improved cooling capacity without restricting. However, it was slightly thicker than the Corsair H100i, which could pose an issue in compact cases. 

Performance-wise, I found that the Alphacool T38, while not exceptionally better than the Corsair H100i, did a solid job in keeping my processor at a consistently lower temperature. It effectively managed to keep my i7 13700k around 70°C during gaming and multitasking, but I noticed that in intense benchmarks like Cinebench, the temperature could reach up to 95-100°C. 

The noise level from the pump and fans was quite acceptable in normal usage, but it became noticeable during more demanding tasks. Adjusting the fan curve helped to keep the fan noise at bay. 

Overall, the Alphacool Core Ocean T38 AIO 280mm offers solid performance at a reasonable price point. However, if you are planning to upgrade to a processor that tends to run hot, it's recommended to consider a larger radiator model. It's unfortunate that some of the mounting hardware had issues, but I still found the product to be an appealing and functional choice.

### [Alphacool Eisbaer LT Water Cooler for CPU](https://serp.ly/amazon/Alpha+Cooler?utm\_term=alphacool-eisbaer-lt-water-cooler-for-cpu)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Alpha+Cooler?utm_term=alphacool-eisbaer-lt-water-cooler-for-cpu"><img alt="alphacool-eisbaer-lt-solo-cpu-water-block-and-pump-black-12887" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alphacool-eisbaer-lt-solo-cpu-water-block-and-pump-black-12887/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Last week, I took a leap into the world of custom CPU water cooling with the Alphacool Eisbaer LT Solo. It was a journey filled with excitement and a few bumps along the way. I'm still working on perfecting my setup, but there are a few things that really stood out to me. 

First off, the integration of the DC-LT 2600 pump with the Eisbaer LT Solo CPU block is absolutely ingenious. This allowed me to easily create a loop for my system, with the flexibility to choose my own hoses and radiators. The pump itself is whisper-quiet, thanks in part to its ceramic coating and the adjustable voltage from 7 to 12 V. 

The radiator made of pure copper and its ultra-fine cross-slot structure has proven to be effective at cooling my CPU. However, I did encounter some challenges when it came to setting up my custom loop. The lack of markings on the pump housing made it difficult to determine the correct flow direction, and I ended up disassembling the unit to figure it out. 

The pump's small impeller and design flaws also caused it to struggle with pumping a significant amount of water. I had to modify the impeller height to overcome these issues, which was a bit of a hassle. 

Overall, the Alphacool Eisbaer LT Solo has been an interesting adventure in the world of custom water cooling. It's given me the opportunity to create a system tailored to my needs, but it's also introduced me to a few frustrating challenges along the way. With some more experimentation and modifications, I'm confident I'll be able to perfect my setup in no time.

Using the Aurora with both Intel LGA 1700 and AMD AM4/AM5 sockets was a breeze, thanks to the versatile design that easily adapts to different mounting configurations. The backplate's sliding fasteners made installation and removal a cinch, and the weighty build gave me confidence in the block's durability. 

One minor downside I encountered was the weight of the Aurora; it's quite a hefty piece of machinery. However, this was more than compensated by the top-notch construction and the user-friendly RGB controls. In comparison to the XP3 I had previously, the Aurora reduced my CPU temperature by a significant 3-5 degrees Celsius, thanks to the integrated Kryosheet. 

While the Aurora was designed primarily for Intel LGA 1700 sockets, a bit of creative adjustment allowed me to use it on my LGA 1200 system as well. For those with a bit of handiwork skills, this may be a viable option for adapting the Aurora to other sockets.
