As someone who's always loved the smell of old books, I was thrilled when the CZUR ET16 Plus Book Smart scanner landed in my hands. It's an ingenious bit of kit that has the power to turn paper into digital format - all the while retaining the essence of the printed page. 

This sleek gadget offers an innovative side lighting feature - which is like a guardian angel for your scans, illuminating every nook and cranny of your beloved tomes. It's kind of like those movie scenes where the hero gets a lucky break - but instead of a convenient light source, the hero in question is a book and it's our luck to get a perfect scan every time.

But the CZUR ET16 Plus isn't just a book scanner, it's also a document scanner and a check reader. It's like having three tools in one. It's versatile, efficient, and incredibly user-friendly. 

The only downside I found was the finger removal feature. While it's pretty good, it could have done a better job. Sometimes the scans would still have the odd yellow finger mark. But I've got faith that the dedicated support team at CZUR will quickly fix this issue. 

Overall, the CZUR ET16 Plus Book Smart scanner is a must-have for any book lover or anyone looking to get rid of the clutter of physical files. It's an investment that pays off in convenience and space-saving. Give it a try, and you might just fall in love with it as much as I did.
