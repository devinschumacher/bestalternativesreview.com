<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Air+Purifying+House+Plants?utm_term=bella-palm-air-purifying-live-parlor-palm-house-plant-for-low-maintenance-indoor-décor"><img alt="shop-succulents-standing-collection-hand-selected-air-purifying-live-parlor-palm-indoor-house-plant--1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/shop-succulents-standing-collection-hand-selected-air-purifying-live-parlor-palm-indoor-house-plant--1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently added a Bella Palm to my living space, and I must say, it's been a delightful addition. Not only does it bring a touch of the tropics to my home, but it also purifies the air, making my space feel fresher and healthier. The container is black and well-designed, blending seamlessly with my decor. One thing I appreciated is that it's a low maintenance plant, perfect for beginners like me. 

However, I noticed the plant needs to be watered every 7-10 days or when the top 1-2 inches of soil is dry. I'd love if there was an easy way to remember this, like a little note or sticker on the pot. Additionally, I found out the hard way that this plant isn't pet-friendly. My curious cat took a nibble and it didn't end well. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase, but there's always room for improvement! 


### [Beautiful Philodendron Hastatum Silver Sword - Air Purifying Live Plant](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Air+Purifying+House+Plants?utm\_term=beautiful-philodendron-hastatum-silver-sword-air-purifying-live-plant)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Air+Purifying+House+Plants?utm_term=beautiful-philodendron-hastatum-silver-sword-air-purifying-live-plant"><img alt="silver-sword-philodendron-live-plant-in-a-4-inch-pot-philodendron-hastatum-silver-sword-stunning-hou-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/silver-sword-philodendron-live-plant-in-a-4-inch-pot-philodendron-hastatum-silver-sword-stunning-hou-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently added the Silver Sword Philodendron to my collection of houseplants, and let me tell you - this plant is a stunner! Its unique metallic-looking leaves with a shiny silver finish make it the perfect conversation starter whenever guests visit. And with its air-purifying capabilities, it's not just a beautiful addition to my home, but also a practical one. 

The Silver Sword Philodendron is a low-maintenance plant when it comes to light requirements, which is a big plus for someone like me who's always on the go. It can adapt to various light conditions, but it grows best in partially shaded areas with indirect sunlight. And while it's a moisture-loving plant, I found that it's pretty forgiving when it comes to watering, as long as I keep an eye on the soil's moisture levels. 

One thing I had to learn quickly was the importance of maintaining the right temperature and humidity levels for my Silver Sword Philodendron. Turns out, it comes from the tropical rainforests of Brazil, so it's used to living in a humid environment. I had to make some adjustments to my indoor conditions to keep it happy and healthy. But overall, this plant is definitely worth the effort. 

Now, let's talk about the actual product. It arrived in a timely manner and was well-wrapped for protection during transit. The pot it came in was a nice touch, too, adding a bit of extra charm to the already beautiful plant. And the best part? It's pet-friendly (just make sure to keep it out of reach of curious pets), so my furry friend can enjoy its beauty, too. 

Overall, I'm thrilled with my purchase of the Silver Sword Philodendron. It's a stunning addition to my home that not only looks great but also helps to purify the air. If you're looking for a unique and low-maintenance houseplant, this one is definitely worth considering.

I recently got my hands on the Costa Farms Money Tree, a live indoor plant that stands tall at around 3-4 feet. I've been growing it in a decorative planter, and it's been a beautiful addition to my indoor space. It's perfect for those who appreciate medium, indirect light, as it thrives best under those conditions. 

The plant requires around 2-3 cups of water once a week, which I've found to be quite manageable. Not only does it purify the air by removing harmful pollutants like benzene and formaldehyde, but it also adds a touch of green and vibrancy to my home.

In this buyer's guide, we'll explore the essential features of air purifying house plants, discuss the considerations you need to make when choosing the right ones, and provide some general advice to ensure their successful integration into your home. 


### Important Features to Consider

When selecting air purifying house plants, consider variables such as their ability to filter the air, ease of care and maintenance, and the aesthetic value they bring to your interiors.

### Air Filtering Abilities

The main reason for having air purifying house plants is their capacity to absorb pollutants and airborne particles. The most effective plants for this purpose have a high surface area to volume ratio, which means that they can trap more particles in their leaves and soil. Some of the most notable air-filtering plants include Spider plants, Bamboo Palms, and Peace Lilies, among others. 


### Ease of Care and Maintenance

It's crucial to select plants that not only purify the air effectively but are also easy to care for and maintain. Some plants may require more attention and regular watering, while others can tolerate neglect. It's essential to do your research and find out which plants will thrive best in your specific home environment.

### Do Indoor Plants Actually Improve Your Home's Air Quality?

Indoor plants can certainly help purify the air by absorbing pollutants and releasing oxygen. Certain plants have a natural talent for removing toxins from the air, like spider plants and peace lilies. Others produce oxygen or attract beneficial microorganisms that consume contaminants, such as snake plants and pothos. 

While you should not solely depend on plants for purifying your air, they can contribute significantly to cleaner indoor environments and ultimately promote a healthier lifestyle. Be sure to research the specific plants that work best for the pollutants present in your home and incorporate a mix of air-purifying and oxygen-releasing plants for optimal benefits. 


### How Many Air Purifying Indoor Plants Do I Need?

The ideal number of plants for air purification depends on several factors, such as your home's size, the number of people and pets, and the types of pollutants present. A general rule of thumb is to have at least one air-purifying plant for every 100 square feet of living space. However, the more plants you have, the greater the benefits, especially if you are dealing with multiple pollutants or have a larger home. 

Use the recommended plant count per square foot as a starting point, but adjust the number based on your home's specific requirements. For example, if you have family members with allergies or pets, consider including extra air-purifying plants to minimize the presence of allergens and potential contaminants.

### Do I Need Special Soil or Fertilizer for Air Purifying Indoor Plants?

No, you don't need special soil or fertilizer to support your indoor plants' air-purifying properties. Choose high-quality, well-draining soil that provides adequate support and nutrients for proper growth and overall health. Most common indoor plants thrive in regular potting soil mixes. 

While using fertilizer can provide essential nutrients to support plant growth, it does not exclusively enhance the air-purifying capabilities of plants. Choose a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer that meets the specific nutrient requirements of your air-purifying plants, and follow the manufacturer's recommendations. Be cautious not to over-fertilize, as excessive fertilizer can harm the plants and compromise their air-purifying properties. 


### Which Are the Best Indoor Plants for Pets?

If you're a pet owner, selecting pet-friendly indoor plants is crucial to prevent your furry friends from accidentally ingesting or coming into contact with soil or plant leaves. Some safe indoor plants that offer air-purifying properties include snake plants, dracaenas, spider plants, and ZZ plants. These plants are non-toxic, known for their air-purifying qualities, and can handle the occasional accident without harming your pets. 

Before bringing any plant into your home, research its safety to ensure its suitability for your pets. Additionally, make sure to place your plants in locations where pets cannot reach them and in areas with good lighting to maintain a healthier environment for both your plants and pets.

### Can Air Purifying Indoor Plants Survive in High-Humidity Environments?

Yes, air-purifying indoor plants can indeed grow in humid environments, provided they receive proper care. High humidity can increase the risk of fungal growth on plant leaves, so make sure to keep the humidity below 60%. Additionally, some plants may require less watering in humid conditions, as moisture can accumulate around the roots. Adjust your watering schedule according to the plant's needs and the level of humidity in your home. 

In humid environments, consider other factors that may affect your plants, such as increased pest infestation and plant diseases. Regularly inspect your air-purifying indoor plants for signs of pests or diseases and take prompt action if you notice any issues. Proper air circulation and plant spacing can help minimize the risks of humidity-related problems. 


### How Do Air Purifying Indoor Plants Affect Indoor Air's Oxygen Levels?

Indoor air-purifying plants do release oxygen into the air, but their primary purpose is to improve air quality by removing pollutants and toxins. Most of the oxygen produced by plants is released as a byproduct of photosynthesis, which requires sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water. The amount of oxygen produced by plants is generally low, compared to other sources like water bodies, soil aeration, or natural decomposition. 

If you want to increase indoor oxygen levels, focus on promoting good ventilation and allowing natural light into the space. Proper air purification practices, along with incorporating air-purifying indoor plants, will significantly contribute to a healthier indoor environment.
