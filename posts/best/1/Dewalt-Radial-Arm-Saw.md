While it might not look like much, this Dewalt Miter Saw has proven to be a game-changer for my workflow. The high portability means I can take it on the go and never have to worry about power outages, making it a lifesaver for my clients with inconsistent electrical connections. The power it packs is surprisingly impressive – I was even able to cut through some large chunks of wood.

A little extra attention might be needed to maintain its performance, but overall, it's a fantastic addition to my toolbox.

### [DeWalt DWS779 Sliding Compound Miter Saw](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dewalt+Radial+Arm+Saw?utm\_term=dewalt-dws779-sliding-compound-miter-saw)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dewalt+Radial+Arm+Saw?utm_term=dewalt-dws779-sliding-compound-miter-saw"><img alt="dewalt-dws779-12-sliding-compound-miter-saw-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/dewalt-dws779-12-sliding-compound-miter-saw-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The DeWalt DWS779 12" Sliding Compound Miter Saw is a powerful tool designed for most cutting applications.

Moreover, the DWS779 was a bit heavy, with a net weight of 56 pounds, making it less portable for those who need to work on multiple projects in different locations. However, the tall sliding fences provided excellent support for crown molding and base molding up to specific dimensions. The inclusion of a 32-tooth carbide blade, while functional for ripping, might not be ideal for all finishing work. 

Overall, the DeWalt DWS779 12" Sliding Compound Miter Saw offers impressive cutting power and accuracy, but its dust collection system and portability could use some improvements.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dewalt+Radial+Arm+Saw?utm_term=dewalt-12-in-double-bevel-sliding-compound-miter-saw"><img alt="dewalt-12-in-double-bevel-sliding-compound-miter-saw-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/dewalt-12-in-double-bevel-sliding-compound-miter-saw-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently came across the DeWalt 12 in. Double-Bevel Sliding Compound Miter Saw and was eager to test it out. My first impression was the sleek design, and I was excited to see how precise it could be. The miter detent plate, which features 10 positive stops, proved to be quite effective in delivering quick and accurate miter angles. 

One of the highlights of this saw was its powerful motor, which delivered a smooth and efficient cutting experience. The sliding fences provided excellent support for a wide range of lumber sizes, allowing me to cut a wide variety of materials with ease. However, I did notice that the sliding action was a bit rough, which impacted the quality of the cut. 

The tall sliding fences were incredibly useful, and I appreciated the ability to make accurate cuts at various angles. The miter and bevel angles were easy to adjust, and the addition of the cam-lock miter handle made fine-tuning a breeze. Nevertheless, I struggled with the weight of the saw, as well as its rather bulky design. This made it difficult to move around my workshop. 

One downside that I encountered was the inadequate dust collection system. Despite the presence of the dust bag, the dust seemed to escape and create quite a mess. Additionally, the noisy operation could be a potential drawback for anyone working in a shared space. 

In conclusion, the DeWalt 12 in. Double-Bevel Sliding Compound Miter Saw is a robust and capable tool, offering precise control and ample cutting capacity. However, its weight and somewhat rough sliding action, coupled with the weak dust collection system, are important factors to consider before making a purchase. Overall, I give this product a solid rating for its performance and useful features, but some areas could use improvement. 


### [Dewalt 12-inch Single Bevel Compound Miter Saw: Precise Miter System and Heavy-Duty Construction](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dewalt+Radial+Arm+Saw?utm\_term=dewalt-12-inch-single-bevel-compound-miter-saw-precise-miter-system-and-heavy-duty-construction)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dewalt+Radial+Arm+Saw?utm_term=dewalt-12-inch-single-bevel-compound-miter-saw-precise-miter-system-and-heavy-duty-construction"><img alt="dewalt-dws715-12-single-bevel-compound-miter-saw-15-amp-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/dewalt-dws715-12-single-bevel-compound-miter-saw-15-amp-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The DeWalt DWS715 12" Single Bevel Compound Miter Saw is a reliable and versatile tool that has become a staple in my workshop. With its stainless-steel miter detent plate and cam miter lock, this miter saw offers precise and durable cuts, making it a standout among its competitors. 

One of the most notable features of this saw is its tall sliding fence, which supports up to 5-1/2-inch base molding vertically and 5-1/2-inch crown molding vertically nested. This provides the flexibility to cut a wide range of materials, making it an indispensable tool for any carpenter or woodworker. 

Despite its powerful capabilities, the DWS715 remains lightweight and easy to transport, thanks to its compact design and built-in carry handle. This makes it a convenient choice for those who need to move their tools between job sites frequently. 

However, the saw does come with a few drawbacks. While it cuts well for many materials, some users might notice a bit of tear-out with certain woods, particularly when using the provided blade. Additionally, the saw could benefit from a dust collection system that more effectively manages sawdust, and it would be even more appealing if it had a soft start and stop mechanism. 

Overall, the DeWalt DWS715 12" Single Bevel Compound Miter Saw is a well-made and powerful tool that has earned its spot in my workshop. While there are a few areas for improvement, its benefits far outweigh its shortcomings, making it an ideal choice for anyone looking for a dependable and versatile miter saw.

Being a woodworker myself, I've had the chance to put the DeWalt DWS779 to the test in my workshop. The first thing that stood out to me was the power of its 15 Amp, 3800 RPM motor. It allowed me to tackle even the thickest pieces of wood with ease. 

Another feature I loved was the tall sliding fences. They provided ample support and stability, allowing me to cut through materials of various dimensions without any wobble. The cam lock miter handle with detent override was a game-changer as well. It made adjusting the miter angles a breeze, giving me precise cuts every time. 

However, one thing that left me wanting was the dust collection. While the bag did a fair job, I often found myself inhaling sawdust due to the lack of a proper dust extraction system. 

Overall, the DeWalt DWS779 is a sturdy and reliable miter saw that excels in delivering precision and power. But if DeWalt could work on improving their dust collection, they'd have a real winner on their hands!
