This rice cooker not only cooks perfect rice every time, but it also doubles as a steamer with its versatile steam menu setting. The convenience of the automatic keep warm, extended keep warm, and reheating cycle is unparalleled. The easy-to-clean clear coated stainless steel exterior is a plus, as is the LCD control panel that switches off when unplugged to conserve internal battery power. 

However, one downside is that the rice does take longer to cook than on the stovetop. Additionally, the included steaming basket makes steaming food over rice tricky, as you need to get everything in there at the beginning and leave it for the full rice cooking cycle. Despite these minor issues, the Zojirushi Micom Rice Cooker and Warmer is an exceptional product that I highly recommend for any rice enthusiast.
