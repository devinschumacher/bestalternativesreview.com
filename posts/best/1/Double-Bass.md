One of the standout features has to be the Polar Pickup System, which allows for flawless expressive potential with both Arco and Pizzicato techniques.

The 12:1 ratio tuning hardware is another impressive element, ensuring precise tuning every time you pick up the bass.

### [Eastwood Sunburst Double Bass Guitar](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Double+Bass?utm\_term=eastwood-sunburst-double-bass-guitar)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Double+Bass?utm_term=eastwood-sunburst-double-bass-guitar"><img alt="eastwood-doubleneck-4-6-sunburst-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/eastwood-doubleneck-4-6-sunburst-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a lover of unique musical instruments, I was ecstatic to get my hands on the Eastwood Doubleneck 4/6 - Sunburst. The moment I held it, I knew it was special. The craftsmanship was impeccable, with the bound maple top and tone-chambered mahogany back and sides contributing to its rich sound quality. 

The sunburst color was a nice touch, adding a pop of warmth to the overall appearance. I was particularly impressed with the pickups - the two EW RTG SC for the 6-string neck and the single bass EW RTG SC for the bass neck. The switching system with 3-way options allowed me to easily switch between different tones. 

However, I must admit that the controls were a tad limited with just one volume and one tone control. This meant that tweaking specific sounds or balancing the volume on each neck was quite challenging. The bridge was a bit fiddly, and having to adjust it while playing didn't make things any easier. 

In conclusion, the Eastwood Doubleneck 4/6 - Sunburst is a visually stunning, high-quality stringed instrument that packs quite the punch. While it may not be perfect, the positives far outweigh the negatives, making it a worthy addition to any musician's collection.

## Buyer's Guide

Choosing the right double bass can be a daunting task for any musician, especially for beginners. This buyer's guide section aims to provide you with essential information, considerations, and advice to help you make an informed decision when selecting a double bass that suits your needs. 


### Types of Double Basses

There are generally two main types of double basses: acoustic and electric. Acoustic double basses are made of wood and produce sound through the vibration of the strings. Electric double basses, on the other hand, have electronic pickups that convert the vibration of the strings into an electrical signal, which is then amplified through a speaker. Each type has its own benefits and drawbacks, so consider your playing style and preferences before making a choice. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Double+Bass"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Double-Bass-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Double-Bass-2" height="540"></a></div>


### Size and Weight

Double basses are large instruments that can be quite heavy. When choosing a double bass, consider the size and weight of the instrument and ensure it will fit comfortably in your performance space. Additionally, consider your physical strength and any potential transportation issues to ensure you can handle and transport the bass easily. 


### Construction Material

The construction material used in making a double bass can significantly impact the instrument's sound quality and durability. Common materials include maple, walnut, and rosewood. Maple and walnut tend to produce a brighter, warmer sound, while rosewood offers a richer, deeper tone. It's essential to choose a bass with a solid construction material to ensure it will last and maintain its sound quality over time. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Double+Bass"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Double-Bass-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Double-Bass-3" height="540"></a></div>


### Bridge and Tailpiece

The bridge and tailpiece are crucial components of a double bass, as they play a significant role in transferring the vibration of the strings to the body of the instrument. A well-designed bridge and tailpiece will help facilitate better sound projection and intonation. Look for a double bass with a high-quality, adjustable bridge and tailpiece to ensure optimal performance. 


## FAQ

### What is a double bass?

The double bass is a large, high-pitched string instrument that belongs to the violin family. It is the largest and lowest-pitched bowed instrument, typically played in an upright position. Double basses are commonly used in orchestras, chamber ensembles, and various other musical genres, including jazz and classical music. 

The size and shape of the double bass make it challenging to play, but its deep, resonant sound is unique and contributes to the richness of musical ensembles. Its large resonance boxes and long strings require specific tools and techniques to tune and maintain, making it a specialized instrument for skilled musicians. 


### What is the difference between an acoustic and an electric double bass?

The primary difference between an acoustic and an electric double bass is the way they produce sound. Acoustic double basses rely on the resonance produced by the instrument itself, while electric double basses use an amplifier and pickups to amplify the sound. This makes an electric double bass more suitable for performances in large venues or when a louder sound is desired. 

Another difference is the convenience of an electric double bass. It is generally easier to transport and handle than an acoustic one due to its lighter weight and smaller size. Additionally, electric double basses often have a higher tuning stability, which makes fine-tuning less demanding. However, acoustic double basses retain their traditional, natural sound, which some musicians prefer for recording sessions and live performances. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Double+Bass"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Double-Bass-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Double-Bass-5" height="540"></a></div>


### What materials are commonly used to make double basses?

The primary materials used to make double basses are wood and steel. The most common wood used is maple, which is strong and resonant, making it ideal for creating the deep, full-bodied sound that double basses are known for. Other woods used include spruce, mahogany, and ebony, each with its unique characteristics and properties. 

For the metal components of double basses, steel is typically used. Steel provides strength and durability, which is essential for the instrument's ability to handle the tension of its strings and the pressure of playing. Steel parts are often blackened or left unfinished, depending on the manufacturer's preference and the intended appearance of the double bass. 


### What are some well-known double bass players?

Throughout history, there have been numerous talented double bass players who have made significant contributions to the instrument's repertoire and the world of music as a whole. Some notable double bass players include Jacqueline du Pré, Gary Karr, Edgar Meyer, and Victor Wooten. Each of these musicians has brought a unique style and approach to playing the double bass, inspiring and influencing generations of musicians in the process. 

In addition to these world-renowned artists, there are countless local musicians, chamber groups, and orchestras that utilize the double bass as a foundational instrument. The rich and vibrant history of the double bass is evident in the countless ensembles and music lovers who continue to embrace and appreciate its distinctive sound.
