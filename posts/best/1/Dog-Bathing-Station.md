Additionally, the leash could have been of higher quality to withstand my dog's energetic and animated moments. 

Despite these minor setbacks, the SHELANDY Pet Grooming Bathtub has been a godsend in maintaining the cleanliness and happiness of my dog. Its durability, practicality, and convenient design make it a worthwhile investment for any pet owner aiming to streamline their grooming routine.

Some stations may require you to connect a hose or attach a showerhead, while others simply need to be positioned on a level surface and secured in place. Many manufacturers also provide installation videos or customer support to assist you with the setup process. 

If you're unsure about installing the bathing station yourself, you can always consult a professional plumber or handyman to help with the process. It's essential to follow the manufacturer's guidelines closely to ensure the station is installed correctly and safely for both you and your dog.
