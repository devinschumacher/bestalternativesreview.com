### [Edge Mazeno Slim Fit Clear Safety Glasses](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Edge+Safety+Glasses?utm\_term=edge-mazeno-slim-fit-clear-safety-glasses)

However, although the Edge Eyewear Mazeno Slim Fit Safety Glasses are designed for safety and style, they are not without their drawbacks. As a non-polarized lens wearer, I found that they were not the most suitable choice for me, as they caused a slight distortion to my vision. Additionally, the slim fit, while comfortable, was slightly tight around the bridge of my nose, causing a slight discomfort after sustained use. 

In summary, the Mazeno Slim Fit Safety Glasses by Edge Eyewear offer a sleek and stylish design, along with unparalleled eye protection against harmful UV rays. Although they have a few minor drawbacks, such as non-polarized lens distortion and tightness around the bridge of the nose, their benefits far outweigh these shortcomings, making them a worthwhile investment for those seeking both style and safety.

### [Patent-Protected Edge Eyewear Dakura Safety Glasses with Medium Welding Lens](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Edge+Safety+Glasses?utm\_term=patent-protected-edge-eyewear-dakura-safety-glasses-with-medium-welding-lens)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Edge+Safety+Glasses?utm_term=patent-protected-edge-eyewear-dakura-safety-glasses-with-medium-welding-lens"><img alt="sw11-ir5-edge-eyewear-dakura-safety-glasses-black-frame-ir-5-0-medium-welding-lens-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sw11-ir5-edge-eyewear-dakura-safety-glasses-black-frame-ir-5-0-medium-welding-lens-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

A few weeks ago, I decided to put these SW11-IR5 Dakura Safety Glasses to the test at my welding shop. Right off the bat, I loved the gloss-black nylon frame—it stood out well from the typical dull industrial safety gear around me. The Edge Eyewear is known to be exceptional, and these glasses certainly lived up to that reputation. 

What stood out the most was the patented frame design. I must say, it was quite comfortable and didn't slip around even when I was wearing a welding mask and getting covered in splashes. The soft TPR temple tips didn't hurt even after hours of wearing them. 

When it came to the welding, the IR 5.0 medium welding lens really did its job. While it might have restricted some of the bright light, it did ensure that no harmful IR rays got through. But beware, only 2% of light does pass through, which for some individuals with sensitive eyes can be a little overwhelming. 

The Edge Eyewear had proven to be a reliable safety tool on multiple occasions. However, I did find that the lenses tended to get scratched over time, and the soft coating wore off as well. But in my opinion, these are minor drawbacks that you can't really expect from safety gear. 

All in all, I found these glasses to be really effective and comfortable. They certainly have become my go-to choice for work and other outdoor activities. Despite some criticisms, I would definitely recommend them to the individuals who need dependable eye protection and don't want to compromise on style.

### What are Edge Safety Glasses?

Edge Safety Glasses are a type of safety eyewear designed to protect the eyes from flying debris, dust, and other airborne particles. They are specifically engineered for users working in environments with high levels of airborne particles, such as construction sites or woodworking shops, where traditional safety glasses may not offer sufficient protection. 

These glasses typically feature wide frames, a low profile design, and side shields to ensure maximum coverage and protection for the wearer's eyes. They are made from sturdy materials, often with anti-fog and scratch-resistant coatings for enhanced wearability and performance in various conditions. 


### What are the benefits of wearing Edge Safety Glasses?

Wearing Edge Safety Glasses offers several benefits, including enhancing the wearer's comfort and safety while working in hazardous environments. Some of the key advantages include reduced eye fatigue, improved visibility, and protection against injuries caused by airborne particles, debris, or high-speed contaminants. These glasses also help maintain clear vision and prevent eye irritation or damage resulting from prolonged exposure to dust or debris. 

Additionally, many Edge Safety Glasses come with features like anti-fog coatings, which help maintain clear vision by preventing the formation of fog or condensation on the lens surface. This ensures optimal visibility and a more comfortable experience for the wearer, even in humid or wet conditions.

### How should Edge Safety Glasses be cleaned?

Cleaning your Edge Safety Glasses properly is essential to extending their lifespan and ensuring maximum protection. First, gently brush off any loose debris or particles using a soft, clean cloth. Then, use a mild soap and water solution to clean the lenses, frames, and side shields. Be sure to avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials, as these can damage the coatings or scratch the lenses. 

To ensure proper drying, avoid placing your Edge Safety Glasses in direct sunlight or near heating vents. Instead, allow them to air dry naturally at room temperature. This will help prevent the formation of any permanent deformations in the glass or frames due to temperature fluctuations or exposure to the elements. 


### How do I choose the right size Edge Safety Glasses for my face?

Selecting the right size Edge Safety Glasses is crucial for ensuring optimal comfort and protection. Start by measuring the width of your face, from one temple to the other, across the bridge of your nose. This measurement will help you determine the appropriate size range for the glasses you're considering. 

Most manufacturers provide a size chart or fitting guide to assist you in selecting the best fit for your face. These charts typically indicate the width of the frame and the distance between the lenses, making it easier to compare different models and determine which one suits your face shape best. For a secure fit, ensure that the glasses sit comfortably on the bridge of your nose and do not slide off your face when you move or work vigorously.

### Do Edge Safety Glasses come in different lens tints?

Yes, Edge Safety Glasses are available in various lens tints to suit different lighting conditions and user preferences. Common tint options include clear, gray, yellow, or smoke lenses. Clear lenses are ideal for indoor use or low-light conditions, while gray and smoke lenses offer enhanced contrast and visibility in bright, sunny environments. 

Yellow or orange lenses are particularly useful for welders and those working in environments with high levels of UV or infrared radiation, as they help filter out blue light and reduce eye strain when using high-intensity lighting sources. Consult the manufacturer's specifications or guidelines to determine which lens tint is best suited for your specific working environment and needs. 


### Are Edge Safety Glasses compatible with prescription lenses?

Yes, many Edge Safety Glasses are designed to accommodate prescription lenses. These models typically feature removable lenses, which can be replaced with your prescribed lenses by an authorized optician or eye care professional. Ensure that your selected Edge Safety Glasses are compatible with prescription lenses and meet the specific requirements of your prescription to ensure optimal safety and clarity. 

For users with specific vision requirements, it's crucial to select Edge Safety Glasses that cater to your needs. Consult with your eye care professional to determine the best option for your prescription and ensure a comfortable, safe, and effective solution for your work environment or activity level.
