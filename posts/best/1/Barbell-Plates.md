What truly impressed me, though, is the dedication to quality the Ivanko company shows in their manufacturing. The discs are crafted using high-quality casting techniques and then meticulously machined on their back and outer face, ensuring a professional and durable finish. 

However, there are a few downsides I have noticed since incorporating these plates into my workout routine. Firstly, I wish there were greater variety in weights and sizes to choose from; having more options would undoubtedly make the selection process more efficient.

## Buyer's Guide

When it comes to acquiring weights for your barbell, there's more to it than just selecting random pieces. To guarantee you're getting the best product to meet your needs, this comprehensive guide will explain crucial features, factors to consider, and general tips for choosing barbell weights.


### Materials

The substance used to create these weights has a significant impact on their durability, weight capacity, and overall performance. Generally, weights are produced from cast iron, steel, or copper alloys. Cast iron weights are economical options, but they're heavier and more vulnerable to rusting. Steel weights are more robust and resistant to corrosion, making them a choice preferred by more serious fitness enthusiasts. Copper alloy weights boast excellent corrosion resistance and an attractive appearance, but they're usually more expensive.

### Weight

From the petite 1.25 pounds to the formidable 100 pounds, weights come in all shapes and sizes. The weight you need isn't something you can easily pick arbitrarily. It all depends on your fitness objectives, your experience, and your exercise routines. Typically, the heavier ones, like the 100-pounders, are perfect for big exercises like squats, deadlifts, and bench press. The lighter ones, or perhaps the 25-pounders, are more suitable for one-on-one exercises or isolating specific muscle groups, such as curls or leg extensions.


### Design

When it comes to the aesthetics and grip of the weights, there are two primary designs: flat and knurled. Flat plates, with their smooth, uninterrupted surfaces, are best for bench presses and other exercises where a certain smoothness aids better performance. Knurled plates, which have a textured surface, provide better control and grip, especially for exercises like squats and deadlifts. Choose the design that best suits your fitness style and the type of activities you want to perform.

### Sizes

Weights come with standardized diameters: 1-inch, 2-inch, and 2.5-inch. Your choice depends on the diameter of your barbell and the type of activities you plan to undertake. For the weights to fit your barbell, cross-check the barbell's diameter and the compatibility of plate size. This simple step can prevent any unnecessary confusion and ensure a seamless fitness experience.

### What are barbell plates?

Barbell plates, also known as weight plates, are the circular components that are attached to both ends of a barbell. They come in various sizes and weight increments to allow for different exercises and weight levels. Barbells with plates can be used for a wide range of exercises, including squats, deadlifts, bench press, and more. 

Barbell plates are typically made from materials such as iron or steel, but some brands also use more durable materials like cast iron or polyurethane. They are designed to be stacked in a pyramid shape, with each plate being slightly smaller than the one above it. This design ensures that the barbell plates are space-efficient and easy to handle during workouts. 


### What are some common sizes of barbell plates?

Common sizes of barbell plates include 2.5 lbs. , 5 lbs. , 10 lbs. , 25 lbs. , 35 lbs. , and 45 lbs. Some brands also offer larger plate sizes for more serious lifters, such as 50 lbs. , 75 lbs. , and even 100 lbs. The weight is typically indicated on the plate's face and the size is determined by its diameter. It's also essential to note that barbell plates may be available in different shapes, with the most common being the Olympic style (2 inches or 50.8 mm in diameter) and the Standard style (1 inch or 25.4 mm in diameter). 

It's a good idea to choose a variety of plate sizes to ensure your barbell is well-rounded and ready for a variety of workouts. Many weightlifting enthusiasts start with a base set of standard plates and then gradually upgrade to heavier Olympic plates as they progress in their strength training journey.

### What are some factors to consider when purchasing barbell plates?

When buying barbell plates, consider the following factors to ensure you're getting the best value for your money and the most suitable product for your needs. Some of these factors include the material used, the brand reputation, the price, and the warranty or guarantee offered by the manufacturer. 

In terms of material, many lifters prefer cast iron plates due to their durability and consistent weight distribution. Polished steel plates may have a more attractive appearance, but they can be more prone to tarnish or rust over time. As for the brand, it's essential to choose a reputable manufacturer with a history of creating high-quality, reliable weight plates. They should also offer a money-back guarantee or warranty in case the plates get damaged during handling or use. 


### What is the difference between barbell plates and dumbbells?

Barbell plates and dumbbells are both used for strength training, but they differ in several ways. One of the most significant differences is how they are designed to be used for specific exercises. Barbells are a collection of metal plates stacked on a bar, while dumbbells have a fixed weight on each end. 

Barbells are typically used for compound movements, such as squats, deadlifts, and bench presses, where the lifter needs to handle more weight for a greater range of motion. Dumbbells, on the other hand, are more versatile and can be used for a variety of exercises, including bicep curls, tricep extensions, and lateral raises. Additionally, dumbbells can be used more easily for unilateral exercises, targeting one limb at a time.

### Do I need to purchase barbell plates if I already have a barbell?

If you already have a barbell without any plates, it's a good idea to purchase some plates. Having a set of plates will allow you to use the barbell for a variety of exercises and different weight levels, enabling you to challenge and progress your strength training program effectively. Additionally, most barbells are designed to be used with plates, so you won't be able to use the barbell to its full potential without them. 

It's also essential to consider the purpose of your barbell. If you're a serious lifter or competing in powerlifting or weightlifting, it's crucial to have a complete set of Olympic plates and possibly even a set of standard plates. However, if you're simply starting out or using the barbell for more recreational purposes, a set of standard plates may be sufficient to help you get started on your strength training journey. 


### Are there any weight plates that can be used on both standard and Olympic barbells?

Yes, some weight plates can be used with both standard and Olympic barbells. These versatile plates are designed to be compatible with both barbell styles due to their adaptability to the different diameters. Look for plates that have a 1-inch locking hole for standard barbells or a 2-inch locking hole for Olympic barbells. 

Using interchangeable plates can be especially convenient if you have both standard and Olympic barbells or if you want the flexibility to switch between them. It can help you save space in your weight room, reduce the number of plates you need to purchase, and make your overall strength training experience more convenient and efficient.
