As a lover of all things classic, I was drawn to the Primo Lanterns BB-22E Copper Lantern. The unique profile design with bottom tempered glass and powder-painted aluminum bracket immediately caught my attention. What stood out though, was the sturdy weather-resistant mounting made from aluminum, coated black, and the finely handcrafted details. 

I recently tried burning it for the first time, and the two 60 watt candelabra electric light clusters provided the perfect illumination that brought warmth and light to my outdoor space. However, the only downside was the initial bend in the first burner. But, the company's excellent customer service and quick response time more than made up for it as they promptly sent a replacement. 

From the classic hand-rubbed copper finish to its robust design, the Primo Lanterns BB-22E Copper Lantern is a standout in my eyes, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a beautifully crafted and functional outdoor light.
