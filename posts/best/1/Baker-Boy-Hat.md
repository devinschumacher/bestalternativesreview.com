### [Ruslan Baginskiy Crystal-Embellished Baker Boy Hat - Black](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Baker+Boy+Hat?utm\_term=ruslan-baginskiy-crystal-embellished-baker-boy-hat-black)

I recently gave the Ruslan Baginskiy Crystal-embellished Baker Boy Hat in Black a try, and let me tell you, it was quite the experience. This hat is a striking piece, with its black wool fabric and stunning crystal embellishments that catch the light in all the right ways. 

One of the features I loved about this hat was its curved peak, which not only adds to its aesthetic appeal but also provides excellent sun protection on those sunny days. The tonal stitching is a nice touch, too, as it adds a bit of elegance and sophistication to the overall design. 

However, there were a few things that I noticed which could be considered as downsides. Firstly, the sizing could be a bit more versatile, as it seemed to run a tad small for some people. Secondly, the hat's construction isn't the most durable, so I would recommend being careful with it to ensure it lasts a long time.

I've always loved Barbour's stylish caps, and their Portland Bakerboy cap is no exception. The first thing that stood out to me was the fit - it's an elegant 6-panel slim profile that just seems to sit perfectly on my head. The peak is stitched down, giving it that classic Bakerboy look that Barbour is known for. 

One of the most notable features of this hat is the durability. It's made from weather-resistant waxed cotton, so you won't have to worry about getting caught in the rain. And even though it's not exactly lightweight, it's surprisingly comfortable to wear all day long. The cotton lining adds a touch of coziness, which is always appreciated when the weather gets chilly. 

There are also some practical elements to this cap that I really appreciate. It has a small Barbour badge on the back, which just adds a bit of flair without being too over-the-top. And even though it's a fashionable choice, it's still very functional - the hat is fully waterproof, so you don't have to worry about getting caught in a sudden downpour. 

The only minor drawback I found was the sizing guide. It seems to be a bit vague, with only small, medium, and large options available. Without more detailed measurements, it was a bit of a guessing game to figure out which size would be the best fit. But, once I found the right size, the cap was truly wonderful and exceeded my expectations. It's definitely a must-have for any Barbour fan, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a chic yet practical hat to add to their wardrobe.
