### [Alien Gear Chest Holster for XDS 3.3](https://serp.ly/amazon/Alien+Gear+Chest+Holster?utm\_term=alien-gear-chest-holster-for-xds-3-3)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Alien+Gear+Chest+Holster?utm_term=alien-gear-chest-holster-for-xds-3-3"><img alt="alien-gear-holsters-shpshft-pddl-hlstr-sprng-xds-3-4" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alien-gear-holsters-shpshft-pddl-hlstr-sprng-xds-3-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently took the ShapeShift Paddle Holster by Alien Gear for a spin, and let me tell you, it was quite the adventure. The first thing that stood out to me was its stability. This holster doesn't just sit there; it securely attaches to your waistband with a paddle that feels like it's made of military-grade materials. I've tried other holsters before, but this one just felt different - it exuded a sense of durability and rigidity. 

But the showstopper? The retention lip. It's like the holster is whispering, "Don't worry, we're in this together. " No matter how rugged the terrain or how much I tried to yank the holster, it just wouldn't budge. It's a reassuring feature that made me feel safe and confident when carrying my firearm. 

One thing that really impressed me was its versatility. I couldn't believe I could adjust the cant in 12-degree increments, all the way up to 360 degrees. It's like having your perfect fit right at your fingertips - or rather, at your waistband. 

However, there were a couple of downsides. The holster, while durable, felt a bit bulky at times, making it slightly uncomfortable to wear for extended periods. And while the paddle attachment felt secure, I found it a bit tricky to get it on and off my waistband, especially in a hurry. 

Overall, the ShapeShift Paddle Holster by Alien Gear is a sturdy and versatile companion for anyone looking for a reliable and stable way to carry their firearm. While it might not be perfect, it certainly has its unique selling points that make it a standout choice among other holsters in the market.

The ShapeShift Core Carry Pack is designed for right-handed use, which I found to be a great feature as it caters to your convenience.
