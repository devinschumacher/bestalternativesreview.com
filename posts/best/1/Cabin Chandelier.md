### [Harper 2 Tier Black Forest Decor Cabin Lighting Chandelier](https://serp.ly/amazon/Cabin+Chandelier?utm\_term=harper-2-tier-black-forest-decor-cabin-lighting-chandelier)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Cabin+Chandelier?utm_term=harper-2-tier-black-forest-decor-cabin-lighting-chandelier"><img alt="harper-2-tier-chandelier-cabin-lighting-from-black-forest-decor-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/harper-2-tier-chandelier-cabin-lighting-from-black-forest-decor-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Recently, I stumbled upon the Harper 2 Tier Chandelier from Black Forest Decor while redecorating my cabin. The moment I saw it, I fell in love with its rustic charm. This 40-inch diameter by 50-inch height beauty, accompanied by a 96-inch-long chain and 144-inch-long wire, has become the centerpiece of my cabin lighting. 

What stood out in my experience was the hand-forged iron coupled with painted driftwood accents, creating a unique blend of traditional and modern. The Florence Gold finish adds a luxurious touch, making it a statement piece in any room. The best part is, it requires only 15 60-watt max candelabra base bulbs, which is a great energy-saving feature. 

However, it's not all smooth sailing. Assembling this 2-tier chandelier might prove challenging due to its size and complexity. And if your ceiling is not high enough, it may not hang as intended. Despite these drawbacks, the Harper 2 Tier Chandelier remains a prized possession. It continues to infuse my cabin with a cozy, warm glow that never fails to amaze my guests. 


### [Elk Six Antler Chandelier Sale - Cozy Cabin Lighting](https://serp.ly/amazon/Cabin+Chandelier?utm\_term=elk-six-antler-chandelier-sale-cozy-cabin-lighting)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Cabin+Chandelier?utm_term=elk-six-antler-chandelier-sale-cozy-cabin-lighting"><img alt="elk-six-antler-chandelier-w-3-down-lights-sale-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/elk-six-antler-chandelier-w-3-down-lights-sale-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Imagine walking into your cabin or game room and being greeted by the warm, inviting glow of this Elk Six Antler Chandelier with three down lights. It's a stunning piece, with its oblong design and six candelabra lights that create a cozy ambiance. The authentic-looking antlers are handcrafted, making it truly unique in your space. 

What first caught my eye was the lightweight, durable polyethylene material used to make the antlers, giving it the genuine feel without the added weight. Although the fixture is internally wired, the included UL approved canopy provides a sense of safety and quality. 

One downside I found was the lack of six candelabra bulbs included with the purchase. The UL requirement for a 25-watt max bulb ensures energy efficiency, but some might find it slightly underwhelming compared to non-UL approved alternatives. 

Overall, this Elk Six Antler Chandelier is an exquisite piece that adds character and charm to any room in your cabin. With its customizable chain and canopy options, it's sure to match your décor perfectly.
