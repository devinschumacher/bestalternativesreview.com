### [Bubba 64 oz. Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel Growler with Rubberized Coating - Licorice](https://serp.ly/amazon/Bubba+Bottle?utm\_term=bubba-64-oz-vacuum-insulated-stainless-steel-growler-with-rubberized-coating-licorice)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Bubba+Bottle?utm_term=bubba-64-oz-vacuum-insulated-stainless-steel-growler-with-rubberized-coating-licorice"><img alt="bubba-64-oz-vacuum-insulated-stainless-steel-rubberized-growler-licorice-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bubba-64-oz-vacuum-insulated-stainless-steel-rubberized-growler-licorice-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try out the Bubba 64 oz. Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel Rubberized Growler in Licorice. This growler has an impressive dual-wall vacuum insulation that guarantees your drink will stay cold for up to 80 hours and hot for up to 26 hours. The stainless steel body is durable and prevents condensation, which is perfect for outdoor events or trips to the beach. 

One of the features that really stood out to me is the wide-mouth opening, which makes pouring and refilling the growler a breeze. I also appreciate how the lid is leakproof and can be easily unscrewed to add more cubes of ice or give the growler a thorough cleaning. With the comfortable handle, carrying this full growler was a piece of cake. 

Although it's top-rack dishwasher-safe, the lid is quite heavy and has a slightly awkward design for consuming liquid as it gets low. While I wouldn't use this particular design again, the insulated technology is truly impressive. After using it for a few weeks, I can confidently say it holds up to its amazing promises. Overall, this Bubba growler is a fantastic investment for enjoying your favorite craft beer or staying hydrated over extended periods in the great outdoors.
