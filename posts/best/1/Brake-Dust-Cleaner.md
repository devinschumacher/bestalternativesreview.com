To ensure safe and effective use of a brake dust cleaner on your car, follow these tips: 
1. Thoroughly read the manufacturer's instructions and cautionary labels before employing the cleaner to comprehend the advised application method, concentration, and safety precautions. 2. Wear suitable personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, eye protection, and a mask to lessen exposure to the cleaning chemicals. 

3. Opt for a cleaner compatible with your wheels' materials and surface type. Avoid using harsh solvents or abrasive agents on delicate surfaces, like painted wheels. 4. Test the cleaner on a small, inconspicuous area of your wheel before applying it to the entire surface to ensure there is no damage or discoloration. 5. Apply the cleaner as directed, and agitate or scrub if necessary, allowing sufficient time for the cleaner to work effectively.
