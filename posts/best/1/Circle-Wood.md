They were 3/16 of an inch thick, making them a perfect size for all sorts of crafts and projects, from magnets and tags to school projects and themed decorations. And with their cute, round shape, I knew that they would look fantastic as accents for any DIY craft project or theme-based decor.

Additionally, the availability of some of the sizes can be a bit limited, so ensure that you order the size and quantity you need. 

Overall, the Circle Wood Cutout is a great choice for anyone looking to add a touch of uniqueness to their art projects. With its variety of sizes and thicknesses, it's sure to become a staple in your creative workspace.

I recently stumbled upon these assorted wooden circle cutouts, and let me tell you, they've added a touch of whimsy to my daily life. At first, I was skeptical of their potential - how much fun could one circle really be? But oh, was I wrong. 

These circles come in a range of sizes, from petite little ones perfect for adorning a scrapbook to big, bold ones that make a statement on a wall. The smaller ones are ideal for hanging ornaments and party souvenirs, while the larger ones are fantastic for creating eye-catching centerpieces or expressive signages.

However, there's one thing I wish I could change: the description doesn't clearly highlight that these circles are unfinished. Be prepared to spend a little extra time sanding or staining these wooden wonders before they're ready to shine. But trust me, the results are worth it. 

In conclusion, these assorted wooden circle cutouts have become an invaluable addition to my crafting arsenal. They're versatile, high-quality, and just begging for a little creativity. If you're in the market for a fun, versatile crafting supply, these circles are a great choice.

The smooth surface allowed me to easily paint, stain, and embellish them with all sorts of materials, from ribbons and beads to stencils and yarn. 

However, there was one thing that I found a bit challenging - cutting the plywood. While it was smooth enough, it was thick enough to make cutting plotters a bit difficult.

However, one thing I did notice was that it was a bit thinner than I expected, which made me wonder about its durability. 

It's a decent product for its price, and I think it suits perfect for quick and simple DIY or craft projects. But for a more substantial build, you might want to look beyond particle board. Despite its minor imperfections, it still served its purpose well. I'm giving this one 3.8 stars.
