### [Beetlejuice-Inspired Revolution Eyeliner "Say My Name](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Beetlejuice+Makeup?utm\_term=beetlejuice-inspired-revolution-eyeliner-say-my-name)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Beetlejuice+Makeup?utm_term=beetlejuice-inspired-revolution-eyeliner-say-my-name"><img alt="revolution-x-beetlejuice-say-my-name-eyeliner-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/revolution-x-beetlejuice-say-my-name-eyeliner-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Revolution x Beetlejuice Say My Name Eyeliner, and I must say, it's quite the showstopper! With its ink as black as Lydia's dark room life, this felt tip liner pen makes creating Halloween detail a breeze, while also being great for an everyday wing look. It's super easy to use and feels really smooth when drawing on those spidery lashes inspired by Lydia's fringe. 

Plus, it's cruelty-free and vegan, which is a major PLUS! The only downside I found is that it can be a bit challenging to wipe off, but overall, I'm quite happy with my purchase. 


### [Revolution x Beetlejuice Lydia Limited Edition Cruelty-Free Vegan Lipstick](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Beetlejuice+Makeup?utm\_term=revolution-x-beetlejuice-lydia-limited-edition-cruelty-free-vegan-lipstick)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Beetlejuice+Makeup?utm_term=revolution-x-beetlejuice-lydia-limited-edition-cruelty-free-vegan-lipstick"><img alt="revolution-x-beetlejuice-lydia-lipstick-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/revolution-x-beetlejuice-lydia-lipstick-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried the Revolution x Beetlejuice Lydia Lipstick, inspired by the wedding dress of the eccentric character Lydia from the cult film. As a dark lip enthusiast, I was excited to see a bold red shade in the collection. The first thing that stood out was the luxurious packaging, complete with Beetlejuice's iconic green designs. 

Upon opening the tube, the creamy, velvety satin finish of the lipstick instantly caught my attention. The lipstick glided effortlessly onto my lips, leaving a vibrant, bright red hue. It did not drag or feel dry, and the color was as bold as it appeared in the tube. The staying power was impressive, lasting up to 5 hours without needing a touch-up. 

One of the highlights of the lipstick was its cruelty-free and vegan formula, which aligns with my personal values. The limited edition nature of the product also added to its allure. However, I did notice that the lipstick was slightly blue-toned, which might not suit all skin tones. This aspect could be a potential downside for those looking for a true-to-pigment red shade. 

Overall, the Revolution x Beetlejuice Lydia Lipstick exceeded my expectations, providing an enjoyable and nostalgic experience straight out of the movie. For fans of the Beetlejuice franchise and dark lipstick lovers, this lipstick is a must-try.

### [Beetlejuice x Revolution Water-Activated Liner for Scary Faces](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Beetlejuice+Makeup?utm\_term=beetlejuice-x-revolution-water-activated-liner-for-scary-faces)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Beetlejuice+Makeup?utm_term=beetlejuice-x-revolution-water-activated-liner-for-scary-faces"><img alt="beetlejuice-x-revolution-barbara-water-activated-liner-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/beetlejuice-x-revolution-barbara-water-activated-liner-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried the Beetlejuice x Revolution Barbara Water-Activated Liner, and let me tell you, it's a fun and unique product! The first time I used it, I applied way too much water and ended up with a smudge that lasted all day - not the look I was going for. But after a few more tries, I finally got the hang of it and managed to create some impressive, dark eyeshadows that looked like they were straight out of a Tim Burton movie. 

My favourite thing about this liner is the versatility. I could switch up my look with just a few drops of water, turning my eyeshadow from a vibrant green to a deep black. It honestly felt like magic! And while I didn't personally use the lipstick option, I've heard great things about it. 

One downside was that it seemed to dry out pretty quickly, and even though it came with a handy brush, it still didn't make the product last very long. I also wasn't a big fan of the packaging; it felt more like a toy than something I would trust with my makeup supplies. 

Overall, the Beetlejuice x Revolution Barbara Water-Activated Liner is a fun and unique addition to any spooky Halloween makeup look, but it does require a bit of practice to master. Just don't forget to apply with a gentle hand and dry brush!
