Lockable handles provide an extra layer of protection for your home or office, particularly if you require more secure entry and exit points. 


### Maintenance and Durability

1. Durability and Longevity: Choose a door pull handle made from a durable and long-lasting material. Metal handles typically provide greater durability, while plastic handles may not be as sturdy.

### What are door pull handles?

Door pull handles, also known as pull doors, are a type of door hardware specifically designed to make opening doors a breeze. These handy devices allow users to effortlessly pull the door towards themselves, making them ideal for various settings, from residential to commercial properties. Pull handles come in numerous designs and styles, catering to different preferences and décor. 

One of the most popular choices for material in pull handles is brass, stainless steel, and chrome. These materials not only offer durability but also provide an appealing aesthetic appeal. In addition, pull handles are available in various shapes such as round or square, with or without a handle extension, offering convenience and comfort for users. 


### What are the advantages of door pull handles?

Door pull handles have several advantages over the traditional knob. They are usually easier to use, particularly for individuals with limited hand strength or mobility issues. Not to mention, pull handles are more hygienic as they do not require direct contact with the door's surface, thus preventing the spread of germs. 

Furthermore, pull handles can enhance a room's elegance and modernity, making them a favorite choice for both interior designers and homeowners. Their availability in diverse styles, materials, and finishes means users can easily find a pull handle that complements their existing interior or sets up a unique look.

### How do door pull handles function?

Door pull handles function by enabling the user to pull the handle towards them, which in turn opens the door. This action is usually accompanied by a latch or catch system that keeps the door closed whenever not in use. Some door pull handles even feature spring-loaded mechanisms that automatically close the door once it's opened. 

To use a door pull handle, simply grasp the handle with your hand and gently pull it away from the door. This will release the catch or latch system, allowing the door to swing open. Post the door's full opening, you can release the handle and let it snap back into place. This action will engage the latch or catch system, securely closing the door. 


### What materials are door pull handles made from?

Door pull handles are typically constructed from materials that offer a combination of strength, attractiveness, and ease of use. Materials popular in pull handles include brass, stainless steel, and chrome. While brass provides a strong and eye-catching metal element, stainless steel offers superb corrosion resistance. Chrome provides a sleek and modern look. However, other materials such as aluminum, iron, or plastics may also be used. The choice of material depends on factors like the desired style, finish, and budget. Generally, pull handles made from superior materials have a longer lifespan and better appearance maintenance compared to those made from lower quality materials.

### Where should door pull handles be installed?

Door pull handles can be installed on a wide range of doors, including entry doors, interior doors, and even closet doors. The optimal location for pull handle installation varies depending on the door's specific features and personal preferences. In most cases, it's best to install the pull handle on the door's outer edge, either at the top or bottom, to make it easier for users to grasp and pull. 

When deciding on the location for pull handle installation, consider factors such as the door's width, height, and existing hardware or fixtures. Accurate measurements should be taken to ensure a proper fit and function. Any necessary adjustments should be made to ensure the handle is installed at the right height for comfortable use. 


### Are door pull handles easy to install?

Yes, door pull handles can be easily installed by DIY enthusiasts or homeowners with basic home improvement knowledge. Most pull handles only require simple tools like a screwdriver, and installation can be completed in minutes. To simplify the process, most manufacturers provide clear, step-by-step installation instructions often accompanied by diagrams or visuals. 

However, for those lacking confidence in their DIY abilities, professional assistance can always be sought. Many hardware stores and home improvement centers offer installation services. Alternatively, a local handyman or contractor can be hired to complete the installation quickly and efficiently.
