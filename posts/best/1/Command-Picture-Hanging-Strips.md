### [Easy-Removal Command Picture Hanging Strips](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Command+Picture+Hanging+Strips?utm\_term=easy-removal-command-picture-hanging-strips)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Command+Picture+Hanging+Strips?utm_term=easy-removal-command-picture-hanging-strips"><img alt="command-medium-picture-hanging-strips-white-40-strips-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/command-medium-picture-hanging-strips-white-40-strips-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried the Command Medium Picture Hanging Strips for my daily life, and I must say, they were quite efficient. The strips were easy to use and perfect for hanging schedules, posters, or lightweight pictures on walls. They stuck well to various surfaces like wood, tile, metal, and even painted ones. The best part was, they didn't leave behind any residue or damage when I removed them. 

However, I did notice some issues. For instance, the strips were not as suitable for heavy frames or larger panels, which might have been a disappointment for those with more substantial items to hang. Additionally, the quality of the strips seemed to degrade over time, which could be a challenge for those who frequently hang or remove items from their walls. 

Overall, the Command Medium Picture Hanging Strips proved to be a handy and versatile tool for daily use, but their effectiveness might not meet everyone's expectations, especially when it comes to weightier items.

Decorate your home with ease and without causing any damage to your walls with the Command Picture Hanging Strips. These 12-count strips are the perfect solution for hanging pictures without the need for nails or tools. Whether you're creating a gallery wall, decorating a nursery or college dorm, or hanging wooden letters, these versatile strips can handle it all.

Plus, they're great for weightless items, making them a perfect choice for acoustic foam boards and other lightweight accessories. 

While these strips provide a convenient and non-damaging way to hang pictures, they might not be ideal for heavier items. Some users have reported that the adhesive loses its stickiness after a few months, causing picture frames to fall off the wall. However, for lighter items, the Command Picture Hanging Strips make a great choice for hassle-free, nail-free decorating.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Command+Picture+Hanging+Strips?utm_term=command-picture-hanging-strips-32-pairs-for-damage-free-decorating"><img alt="command-small-medium-large-picture-hanging-strips-ph211-32na-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/command-small-medium-large-picture-hanging-strips-ph211-32na-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Command Poster Hanging Strips: 140 Count Pack for Secure Picture Display](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Command+Picture+Hanging+Strips?utm\_term=command-poster-hanging-strips-140-count-pack-for-secure-picture-display)

I recently tried these Command Poster Hanging Strips, hoping they would help me hang my favorite motivational quotes around the house. The product claims to securely hold calendars and other flexible objects, with no sagging or falling. I was excited to put them to the test, but it didn't go as planned. 

First, I started by following the package instructions, ensuring the wall and frames were clean and dry. I chose a suitable spot on the wall, stuck the strip to the back of the frame, and adhered it to the wall. After applying the strips and waiting for an hour, I was ready to rehang my frames. However, the click of the strips connecting didn't reassure me as it should have. 

Soon enough, the frustration began as one frame after another fell off the wall. It seemed that these strips were not doing their job. I was disheartened because I had expected a hassle-free way to decorate my home with these strips. I ended up having to tape the frames to the wall, which was far from my goal. 

The Command Poster Hanging Strips have their pros and cons. On the positive side, they claim to be easy to use and remove without causing any damage to your walls. However, in my experience, the strips did not hold firmly, and removing them left the wall with residue. 

Overall, I was disappointed with the performance of these Command Poster Hanging Strips. It's unfortunate because the idea behind the product is great, but it needs improvement in terms of adherence to the wall and the ease of its use.

I recently used Command Jumbo Picture Hanging Strips to hang a few large framed mirrors in my home. At first, I was impressed by how easily I could hang the mirrors without leaving any holes, sticky residue, or marks on my walls. The strips seemed sturdy and versatile, holding strongly on a variety of indoor surfaces, including painted walls, concrete, and even cinderblock. However, after a few months, I noticed that the adhesive on some of the strips was starting to fail. 

One of the highlights of this product is its damage-free hanging capabilities. It was easy to apply and remove the strips without causing any damage to my walls. The jumbo size also made it convenient for hanging heavier items. However, the product did have some negatives. Despite its strong initial hold, the adhesive on the strips didn't seem to last as long as I had hoped. This was especially noticeable when hanging items with more weight, like mirrors. Furthermore, the strips were not as effective in extreme weather conditions, as mentioned by some users. 

Overall, I think Command Jumbo Picture Hanging Strips are a good option for hanging lighter items without causing damage to your walls. However, if you're planning to hang heavier items or live in an area with harsh weather conditions, you might want to consider alternative options that offer more durability and adhesion.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Command+Picture+Hanging+Strips?utm_term=command-picture-hanging-strips-secure-removable-decorating-solution"><img alt="command-sawtooth-picture-hanger-value-pack-white-l-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/command-sawtooth-picture-hanger-value-pack-white-l-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Command Sawtooth Picture Hanger Value Pack and I must say, it made hanging pictures a breeze. The no-nail, no-hole design meant I didn't damage my walls while still being able to securely hang my pictures. 

The packaging stated that the hangers held strongly and removed cleanly, and I found that to be true. The pictures stayed in place and it was effortless to remove them when I decided to rearrange my wall decorations. 

However, I did notice that they don't work as well with just the picture hangers alone, especially if you plan on hanging heavy items. It's best to use the suggested "sawtooth" hangers for a secure fit. 

Despite this minor inconvenience, the product was generally easy to use and offered a convenient solution for renters or those who want to avoid damaging their walls. I definitely see myself using these hangers more in the future, especially when I need to hang lightweight items around my home.
