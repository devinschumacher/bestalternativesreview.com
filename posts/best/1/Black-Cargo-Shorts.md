### [Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Ripstop Black Cargo Shorts](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Black+Cargo+Shorts?utm\_term=amazon-essentials-mens-lightweight-ripstop-black-cargo-shorts)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Black+Cargo+Shorts?utm_term=amazon-essentials-mens-lightweight-ripstop-black-cargo-shorts"><img alt="amazon-essentials-mens-10-lightweight-ripstop-stretch-cargo-short-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/amazon-essentials-mens-10-lightweight-ripstop-stretch-cargo-short-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried on the Amazon Essentials Men's 10" Lightweight Ripstop Stretch Cargo Shorts and had an experience to share. The shorts were incredibly comfortable and had a great fit. I appreciated that they were made from a lightweight ripstop fabric, allowing for a smooth stretch. 

One of the issues I faced with the shorts was that they were not very durable. Despite their lightweight design, I experienced some roughness in the materials, causing them to fray after a few weeks. Additionally, the side pockets that were intended for added storage tended to be a little too shallow, making it difficult to keep my essentials secure. 

On the brighter side, the shorts had a button closure on them, which I thought was a nice touch, giving the wearer some flexibility in terms of the closure style. I also liked the straight leg design, which was perfect for both casual and formal occasions. 

In summary, the Amazon Essentials Men's 10" Lightweight Ripstop Stretch Cargo Shorts provided a comfortable fit, but issues with durability and shallow pockets made the overall experience a bit disappointing.

Their multiple pockets provide ample storage space for essentials such as wallets, keys, and tools, ensuring that users can easily carry gear and equipment while on the go. Additionally, the durable materials used in their construction make them resistant to wear and tear, allowing them to withstand the demands of outdoor environments. 

Many cargo shorts also feature a relaxed fit and are made from breathable materials, ensuring that users remain comfortable even during strenuous activities. This combination of practicality and comfort makes black cargo shorts a popular choice among men looking for versatile, functional bottoms suitable for outdoor adventures and casual wear alike. 


### Are there any downsides to Black Cargo Shorts?

While black cargo shorts have several benefits, some users may find that their multiple pockets and bulky design can be disadvantageous in certain situations. For instance, some may find that the cargo pockets can snag on objects or cause discomfort when sitting for extended periods. Additionally, the loose fit of some cargo shorts may be less flattering on some body types, as they can create a "baggy" appearance if not paired with the right clothing. 

In terms of style, black cargo shorts tend to be more utilitarian in design, which may not be suitable for all occasions. While their practicality and durability make them a great choice for outdoor activities, some users may prefer other styles of shorts for more formal or dressy events. However, most black cargo shorts are available in a variety of lengths, colors, and materials, allowing users to find a style that suits their personal taste and preferences. 


### How do I choose the right size and style of Black Cargo Shorts?

To find the right size and style of black cargo shorts, it's essential to consider your body type, personal style, and intended use. For instance, if you prefer a loose, comfortable fit, you may want to opt for a size that allows movement and flexibility. Alternatively, if you prefer a more fitted look, you can choose a slim-fit or tailored style. Many brands offer size guides or sizing charts to help you determine the most flattering size for your body type. 

In terms of style, consider your personal preferences and the intended use of the shorts. If you plan to wear them primarily for outdoor activities, you may want to choose a more rugged, durable style. If you prefer a more fashion-forward look, you can opt for cargo shorts made from softer, more breathable materials, or with a more streamlined, modern design.
