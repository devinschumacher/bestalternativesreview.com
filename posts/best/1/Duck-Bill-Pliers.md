During my first use, I found the plier perfect for pulling wires or removing stubborn staples from various materials. Its wide jaw was versatile enough to handle different types of tasks without any trouble. However, I noticed that the plier's build quality didn't quite live up to the brand's expectations. A couple of times while using it, the plier's head seemed to loosen a bit, requiring me to tighten it with a screwdriver. 

Despite this minor issue, my Genius Tools Duckbill Pliers have become a staple part of my toolkit.
