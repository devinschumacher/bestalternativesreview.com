When I first saw this Banneton Bread Basket, I was drawn in by its stunning craftsmanship and natural rattan design. As a lover of homemade bread, I couldn't wait to give it a try. 

The seamless, splinter-free surface was a delight to work with, allowing my dough to hold its shape effortlessly. Plus, the non-stick liner made removing my freshly baked loaf a breeze. 

However, I did notice that the basket required some dusting to prevent sticking, and I had to be cautious when removing the liner to avoid it sticking to my bread. Overall, this Banneton Basket proved to be a worthy addition to my baking routine, and I was grateful for its beautiful design and practicality.

### [Breadtopia Round Banneton Basket](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Banneton+Basket?utm\_term=breadtopia-round-banneton-basket)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Banneton+Basket?utm_term=breadtopia-round-banneton-basket"><img alt="breadtopia-banneton-round-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/breadtopia-banneton-round-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The round Breadtopia banneton is a true game-changer in the world of bread baking. Its eco-friendly composite of 30% recycled maple wood fiber and 70% certified food-safe, BPA and phthalate-free polypropylene makes it a sustainable choice without sacrificing durability. The top rack dishwasher safety is an added bonus for those who prioritize saving time on cleaning. 

I found the basket to be a perfect companion in my bread-making journey. Its textured surface perfectly holds the dusting of flour, giving my bread an authentic, artisanal appearance. The concentric pattern adds a touch of elegance and makes it a standout piece in any kitchen. 

While the round basket is indeed versatile and durable, I encountered a slight inconvenience with its size. It can only accommodate doughs ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 pounds. So, for those baking larger loaves, an oval or square-shaped banneton might be a better fit. 

Overall, the round Breadtopia banneton is a great choice for bread enthusiasts looking for an eco-friendly and functional baking companion.

The size of the basket allows it to accommodate doughs ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 pounds, even those as dense as 70% hydration doughs. Not only is it functional, but its design enhances the aesthetic appeal of my kitchen. 

The top rack dishwasher-safe feature of the Round Basket is a game-changer, as it eliminates the need for manual cleaning – a task I used to dread.

### [Round Proofing Baskets for Artisan Bread Making](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Banneton+Basket?utm\_term=round-proofing-baskets-for-artisan-bread-making)

I've been using the Round Proofing Baskets for a few weeks now and I have to say, they've become my go-to for proofing some fantastic doughs. One of the things that stood out to me was the sturdiness of the baskets - they're made from rattan cane material which makes them a perfect addition to any kitchen. 

The baskets come with a score lame and five extra blades for scoring, which is just as helpful as they are necessary. They also come with a plastic dough scraper to ensure everything is nice and clean. One thing I did notice was that it can be a bit tricky to clean the baskets, especially after using them for sourdough bread, but a gently rinse with water usually does the trick. 

The baskets themselves hold up to 1.5 pounds of dough, so perfect for any sort of bread recipe. The round shape provides a great shape for a loaf of bread and I've found it makes my homemade breads turn out really great. 

One thing I did notice was that the baskets can be a bit hard to store once you've used them, but I've found that this can be solved quickly by shoving the excess flour out of the way and storing them in a cool, dry place. Overall, I've enjoyed using these proofing baskets - they're easy to use, clean, and have made my homemade breads turn out beautifully. They're definitely worth the investment!

One of the best parts is that the cloth is made to absorb moisture from the dough, ensuring a healthier, more flavorful final product. And for those of us who tend to get messy in the kitchen, the proofing cloth liner keeps the dough away from dust, allowing it to stay perfectly shaped until it's ready to be transferred onto the baking sheet. 

However, it's worth mentioning that the set only includes the proofing cloth and not the actual proofing baskets you'll need. So, be sure to have those on hand before you start.

Larger baskets are suitable for traditional loaves, while smaller ones work well for baguettes or other long, narrow bread shapes. 


### Materials

Banneton baskets are typically made from natural materials such as wicker, linen fibers, or rattan. Wicker baskets are usually more durable than others but can be less flexible. Linen-reinforced wicker baskets provide a balance between flexibility and durability, while rattan baskets offer a more flexible alternative for shaping sticky doughs. When selecting a banneton basket, consider the trade-off between durability and flexibility, depending on your specific needs.

### The Secret to a Perfect Banneton Basket

Proper care and maintenance are key to keeping your banneton basket in top shape. First, make sure to clean the basket thoroughly after each use, removing any dough or debris. Rinse it with warm water and gently scrub it with a soft brush or cloth. After cleaning, let the basket dry completely before storing it. This will prevent mold and bacteria from growing and help extend the life of your basket.

And don't forget to oil your basket regularly with a food-grade oil like vegetable oil or beeswax. This will help prevent the fibers from drying out and becoming brittle. Depending on the frequency of use, a banneton basket may need oiling every few weeks or months. Always consult the manufacturer's instructions or guidelines for specific care recommendations.
