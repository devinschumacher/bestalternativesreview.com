### [Threshold Studio McGee Gold Wavy Decorative Bowl](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Decorative+Bowl?utm\_term=threshold-studio-mcgee-gold-wavy-decorative-bowl)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Decorative+Bowl?utm_term=threshold-studio-mcgee-gold-wavy-decorative-bowl"><img alt="metal-wavy-bowl-gold-threshold-designed-with-studio-mcgee-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/metal-wavy-bowl-gold-threshold-designed-with-studio-mcgee-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently added the "Metal Wavy Bowl Gold" from Threshold designed with Studio McGee to my home decor and it has made a significant impact. This stunning piece with a wavy shape is made of aluminum, giving it a shiny gold finish that adds a luxe touch to any room. The size and wavy design of the bowl make it perfect for placement on a shelf or tabletop, adding grace to my space. 

However, there were a few minor issues I faced. The bowl can look slightly damaged at times due to the gold finish being easily scratched, and some customers had complained about it being rather cheaply made. Additionally, the product description mentioned it as food safe, but I later discovered it's for decorative use only, which was a bit disappointing. 

Overall, I still love the "Metal Wavy Bowl Gold, " but it's essential to know the pros and cons before deciding to invest in one, given the potential issues with the finish and the fact that it's not food safe.

With its crystal glass construction, this small yet striking bowl is perfect for enhancing everyday meals.

Employing this bowl has been a delightful experience. The crystal material is not only durable but also feels sturdy and sophisticated. However, as with any delicate crystal glass, care should be exercised to avoid breakage.

I discovered that the small size of the Plaza Bowl is versatile and suitable for various purposes. It fits perfectly on my dinner table, and its sophisticated design makes it an excellent addition when entertaining guests. Although some might prefer a larger version, I believe the smaller size adds to its charm and versatility.

To summarize, the Orrefors Plaza Bowl is a stunning piece that exudes an air of sophistication to any meal. Although it necessitates careful handling, the durability and distinctiveness of this crystal bowl make it a worthwhile investment.

### How do you care for a decorative bowl?

Caring for a decorative bowl depends on the type of material it is made of. For glass bowls, it is important to avoid placing them in direct sunlight or near heating sources, as this can cause the glass to fade or discolor over time. When cleaning a glass bowl, it is best to use a soft, lint-free cloth to avoid any scratches or damage. Some glass bowls may require careful handling or special cleaning instructions, so be sure to read the care instructions provided by the manufacturer. 

For ceramic or metal decorative bowls, it is important to avoid exposing them to extreme temperatures, as this can cause the material to crack or warp. When cleaning a ceramic or metal bowl, it is best to use a soft, non-abrasive sponge or cloth to avoid any scratches or damage. It is also important to avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, which can damage the finish of the bowl.
