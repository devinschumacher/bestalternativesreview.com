The hollow rails in the front create significantly more flex that adds to the higher launch and speed.

However, the new carbon fiber material is thinner and lighter, which does make the club more flexible and allows for better weight movement for control.

### [Cobra King Radspeed Fairway Wood: High-Performance Golf Club](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Cobra+Rad+Speed?utm\_term=cobra-king-radspeed-fairway-wood-high-performance-golf-club)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Cobra+Rad+Speed?utm_term=cobra-king-radspeed-fairway-wood-high-performance-golf-club"><img alt="cobra-king-radspeed-fairway-wood-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cobra-king-radspeed-fairway-wood-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

However, I did have a few drawbacks when using this fairway wood. Despite the medium to high launch angle, I found it challenging to get the desired loft and distance, which was my main goal when purchasing the club. Moreover, the lightness of the club didn't really suit my playing tempo, and I had to adjust my swing a bit to make it work. 

Overall, I believe the Cobra King Radspeed Fairway Wood is an impressive piece of equipment that has been well-received by many golf enthusiasts. It has its ups and downs, and like any other product, it may not work for everyone.

Arriving at my door, it looked sleek and impressive, with the Cobra logo emblazoned on the head. 

One of the first things that caught my attention was the adjustable weight system on the driver. The RADSPEED Driver features a forward-biased design with weights positioned for optimal spin and speed. While I had some experience with adjustable weight systems in other clubs, this was my first time using the RADSPEED and I was eager to give it a test drive. 

Out on the course, the club performed exceptionally well. The ball speed was impressive, with the driver delivering the best distance I've ever had with a single club. The feel of the club was solid, with the Cobra name living up to its reputation for quality. 

However, not everything was perfect. I did notice a bit of a learning curve when it came to the adjustable weight system. Switching the weights felt a bit finicky at first, with the driver providing no clear indication when the weights were properly in place. An adjustment tool, which was included with the purchase, can make the process smoother. 

Additionally, the club's shape was unique – it felt a bit different from the more standard drivers I've used in the past. While it might take some getting used to, I eventually grew to appreciate the way it fit into my swing. 

In conclusion, the Cobra RADSPEED Driver provided a game-changing experience for me as a golfer, offering impressive ball speeds and distance.
