Regular maintenance, such as cleaning or replacing bulbs, can significantly extend the lifespan of decorative patio lights. Following the manufacturer's guidelines for installation and care can help ensure a longer and more reliable service from these products. With proper care and installation, decorative patio lights can bring enjoyment and practical benefits to homeowners for years to come.
