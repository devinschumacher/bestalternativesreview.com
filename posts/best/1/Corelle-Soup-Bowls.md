It is essential to choose soup bowls made with quality materials to ensure their longevity and overall performance. 


### Size and Capacity

The size and capacity of the soup bowl should be considered based on your personal preferences and the number of servings required. Corelle soup bowls come in various sizes, ranging from 12 to 24 ounces. The most common sizes are 12 and 14 ounces, which are suitable for individual servings.

## FAQ


### Why is Corelle Soup Bowl Different from Other Soup Bowls?

What makes Corelle Soup Bowls stand out is their durability and adaptability. Utilizing Corelle's special Triple Fortified Glass, these bowls resist chipping, cracking, and scratching, ensuring they retain their good looks and functionality for a long time. Notably, they are lightweight and heat-resistant, making them ideal for serving both hot and cold food items. 

What's more, Corelle Soup Bowls come in a variety of hues and designs, giving users the chance to select the perfect match for their kitchen décor or table setting. From the classic white to bold and vibrant colors, there's a Corelle collection piece for every taste and lifestyle. This combination of durability, versatility, and style accounts for the popularity of Corelle Soup Bowls among cooking enthusiasts and food lovers. 


### Are Corelle Soup Bowls Safe for Microwave Use?

Yes, Corelle Soup Bowls are safe to use in the microwave as long as the Triple Fortified Glass can tolerate high temperatures without warping, cracking, or releasing hazardous substances. This means you can safely heat your soup, stew, or chili in these bowls, without worrying about the well-being of your food or dishware. 

However, it is a good idea to consult the manufacturer's guidelines and strictly adhere to the general guidelines for using microwave-safe dishes. Also, avoid drastic temperature fluctuations, as sudden heating or cooling might lead to the glass expanding or contracting, ultimately resulting in cracks. 


### Can Corelle Soup Bowls be Used in the Dishwasher?

Good news for those who prefer a hassle-free cleaning experience, Corelle Soup Bowls are dishwasher-friendly! Simply load the dirty bowls into your dishwasher, add the appropriate cleaning solution, and run the cycle like you would with any other dishware. The Triple Fortified Glass is resistant to dishwasher detergent and high-pressure water, making these bowls durable even with frequent use.

It is recommended, however, to place the bowls upside down when loading the dishwasher to avoid scratches and to maintain their shine. Also, avoid stacking the bowls on top of each other, as doing so might increase the likelihood of scratches and could impair the dishwasher's effectiveness in cleaning each item. 


### What Materials are Used to Make Corelle Soup Bowls?

Corelle Soup Bowls are made from a unique material known as Triple Fortified Glass. This glass combination of soda lime glass, along with quartz and feldspar materials, significantly strengthens the glass, making it more resilient and resistant to chipping, cracking, and scratching. This process also results in a lighter and heat-resistant glass. 

The distinctive Triple Fortified Glass creates a smooth and clear appearance, and the bowls are available in various colors, patterns, and designs. The high-quality materials used in creating Corelle Soup Bowls are a testament to their durability and the bowls' aesthetic appeal. 


### Do Corelle Soup Bowls Come with a Warranty?

Yes, Corelle provides a limited lifetime warranty for their soup bowls and other products. This warranty covers any manufacturing defects in the product's materials or construction. However, it does not cover damages resulting from accidents, normal wear and tear, or misuse of the product. 

To enjoy the benefits of the warranty, it is crucial to register your Corelle Soup Bowls with the manufacturer within 30 days of purchase. Registration information can generally be found on the product packaging, the Corelle website, or by contacting the company directly. By registering, you will have access to warranty information along with instructions for filing a claim. 


### What Colors and Patterns are Available in Corelle Soup Bowls?

Corelle offers an extensive collection of colors and patterns in their soup bowls, allowing every user to find a bowl that fits their kitchen décor and personal preferences. Some popular options include solid colors like white, black, red, and blue, as well as various pastels and vibrant shades. These colors come in both matte and glossy finishes.
