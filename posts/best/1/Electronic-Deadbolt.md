<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Electronic+Deadbolt?utm_term=defiant-matte-black-smart-wi-fi-deadbolt-with-hubspace-integration"><img alt="defiant-round-matte-black-smart-wi-fi-deadbolt-powered-by-hubspace-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/defiant-round-matte-black-smart-wi-fi-deadbolt-powered-by-hubspace-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Milocks XFK-02AQ Digital Deadbolt Lock and Passage Knob Set](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Electronic+Deadbolt?utm\_term=milocks-xfk-02aq-digital-deadbolt-lock-and-passage-knob-set)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Electronic+Deadbolt?utm_term=milocks-xfk-02aq-digital-deadbolt-lock-and-passage-knob-set"><img alt="milocks-xfk-02aq-digital-deadbolt-door-lock-and-passage-knob-combo-with-keyless-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/milocks-xfk-02aq-digital-deadbolt-door-lock-and-passage-knob-combo-with-keyless-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a product reviewer, I recently installed the Milocks XFK-02AQ Digital Deadbolt Door Lock and Passage Knob Combo with Keyless in my house. It was a breeze to replace my old deadbolt and knob setup with this one. The keypad glows in the dark, making it super easy to see the buttons in the late hours. One of the best features in this combo is the ability to add up to 10 keypad users and 10 remotes. If you've got kids, you'll love the simplicity of sharing a code instead of messing around with keys. 

This combo comes with a built-in motor and latch, so it operates smoothly and requires little effort. However, it does consume 4 AA batteries, so make sure you have some on hand. The adjustable latch and handle are solid, but I wish the packaging was more accurate with the color options. All in all, I'm pretty satisfied with my purchase. I'd definitely recommend this Milocks lock combo to others looking for an upgrade to a more convenient and secure entry system.

As someone who's had their fair share of dealing with traditional locks, this smart lock U100 changed the game. It's not just a lock, it's a security system combined with design. Unlocking my door with the Apple Home Key on my iPhone, it feels like a future not yet explored. The touchscreen keypad adds an extra layer of convenience and security. 

The fingerprint recognition feature in the lock is something I've grown to appreciate. No more fumbling with keys when your hands are full. The weatherproof feature is a blessing for someone living in a city with unpredictable weather. Yet, it's not without its flaws. Occasionally, the touchscreen becomes unresponsive, but a quick reboot solves the issue.
