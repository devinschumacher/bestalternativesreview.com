I recently stumbled upon this Plain Hoosier Brass Latch and Catch, which is a charming reproduction of an antique Hoosier cabinet door latch. Made from stamped brass, it measures 1.12 inches in height, 2.25 inches in depth, and has a width of 1.8 inches.

Adding this to an antique restoration project or using it as a vintage touch to modern home decor was a delight for me. 

Although the latch fits snugly to the door, it may prove challenging to operate the doors with the screws on the catch. Regardless, the overall quality and design of this Plain Hoosier Brass Latch and Catch make it a worthwhile addition to any cabinet, vintage or modern.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cabinet+Catches?utm_term=amerock-magnetic-cabinet-catch-tan"><img alt="amerock-bp9765pt-magnetic-catch-tan-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/amerock-bp9765pt-magnetic-catch-tan-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently needed a replacement magnetic catch for my kitchen cabinets, and I was thrilled to find the Amerock BP9765PT Magnetic Catch in Tan that perfectly matched the ones on all the other cabinets. Not only did the catch fit perfectly, but it also didn't require any adjustments like the previous one. I love that it's made of plastic, which makes it lightweight and easy to install.

These magnetic catches are a great addition to any cabinet or drawer in need of a secure closing mechanism. I've used them on my kitchen drawers and found that they're super easy to install, thanks to the included screws. The white finish matches well with most furniture, and the catch is magnetic enough to keep doors closed tightly. However, I've noticed that the strength of the magnet isn't as strong as I'd like, causing the door to bounce open when closed with too much force. 

The biggest advantage of these catches is how simple they are to install. Within minutes, I had them securely mounted on my cabinets, providing a more reliable closing method for my kitchen drawers.

### What are Cabinet Catchers?

Cabinet Catchers, commonly known as door catches, are hardware devices designed to secure and latch cabinet doors for enhanced safety and functionality. Available in various designs and materials, including metal, plastic, and wood, they can be surface-mounted or built into the cabinetry for different aesthetics. These catchers play a vital role in maintaining the integrity of your cabinet doors, ensuring they remain closed as required and preventing them from accidentally flying open during use or when someone accidentally touches them. They are widely used in residential, commercial, and institutional settings to improve the durability and appearance of cabinet doors.


### What are the different types of Cabinet Catchers?

Numerous types of Cabinet Catchers are available on the market, each with its unique design, advantages, and applications. Some of the most common types include:

1. Surface-mounted catches, which are mounted on the surface of the cabinet door and can be easily installed and removed.

2. Concealed catches, which are built into the cabinet door or frame for a more discreet appearance.

3. Magnetic catches, which use magnetic force to hold the cabinet door in place and can be easily removed for cleaning, maintenance, or accessibility.

4. Spring-loaded catches, which rely on a spring mechanism to push the door closed and hold it in place.

5. Latch-style catches, which feature a latch mechanism that engages when the door is closed for added security and durability.

Each type of Cabinet Catcher serves specific purposes and has its pros and cons, so it is essential to consider factors such as door size, material, installation location, and personal preference when selecting the appropriate catcher for your cabinetry. Always consult the manufacturer's guidelines or seek professional advice to ensure proper installation and function.

Installing Cabinet Catchers involves a few steps that may vary depending on the type and design of the Catcher you have chosen. Generally, the installation process involves the following steps: 
1. Determine the specific location where you want to mount the Catcher on the door or cabinet frame. 2.
