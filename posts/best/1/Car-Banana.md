<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Car+Banana?utm_term=premium-locking-expanding-banana-plug-with-24k-gold-plated-contacts-and-carbon-fiber-wrapped-shell"><img alt="parts-express-091-3614-expanding-banana-plug-with-dual-set-screws-and-carbon-fiber-wrapped-brass-she-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/parts-express-091-3614-expanding-banana-plug-with-dual-set-screws-and-carbon-fiber-wrapped-brass-she-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

These locking, expanding banana plug connectors stand out with their modern appeal, thanks to the real carbon fiber wrapped around the brass shell. Made with a removable threaded sleeve and two flat-head screws, these plugs ensure a gas-free connection between the speaker wire and the connector. The central spike locks the banana plug firmly into 5-way binding posts and banana jacks. The only thing to be cautious about is when using high-strand cables, tinned leads are best for the set screws to provide the greatest retention. 

In my experience, these banana plugs are a game-changer. They are sturdy and hold tightly on speaker wires, providing a worry-free connection. The color-coded rings help in identifying the polarity of the cables quickly. However, one minor issue is that the barrel might be difficult to turn when placed in awkward locations to expand the connector. 

Overall, these Parts Express banana plug connectors are a reliable and stylish choice for anyone looking to ensure a strong and secure connection between their speaker wires and amplifiers.

I recently tried out Roav by Anker's SmartCharge Car Kit, which is a Bluetooth FM transmitter with 2 USB charging ports and a car locator function. Overall, I found it to be a pretty useful device for my daily life.

### [Blazin Banana Car Wax Spray - Slick Protection and Deep Shine](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Car+Banana?utm\_term=blazin-banana-car-wax-spray-slick-protection-and-deep-shine)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Car+Banana?utm_term=blazin-banana-car-wax-spray-slick-protection-and-deep-shine"><img alt="chemical-guys-spray-wax-blazin-banana-16-fl-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/chemical-guys-spray-wax-blazin-banana-16-fl-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Blazin' Banana is a game-changer in the world of car waxing. Its unique spray-on formula allows for a no-cure time, giving your vehicle a glorious shine and reflection almost immediately. The easy-to-apply nature of this wax is perfect for those of us who don't have hours to spend on car washing and waxing. 

Not only does the Blazin' Banana promise to leave your car with a deep wet shine, but it also claims to offer protection against road debris and environmental pollutants. It even boasts an incredible water beading feature. But don't just take my word for it. With 4.7 stars out of 5 and 277 reviews, the Blazin' Banana clearly has a dedicated fan base. 

One downside, though, is the potential for residue when applying the wax. But as with most things in life, a bit of elbow grease and a premium microfiber towel can sort that out. The sprayable all-season weather protection is also a fantastic bonus, giving you the security of knowing your car is well-protected no matter the weather. 

However, the downside here is the price. The Blazin' Banana doesn't come cheap, which might deter some consumers. Overall, for those who are willing to invest for a quick, effective car waxing solution, the Blazin' Banana from Chemical Guys could be just the ticket.
