### [Winnett Blue Light-filtering Valance Curtain Three Posts](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Blue+Valances?utm\_term=winnett-blue-light-filtering-valance-curtain-three-posts)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Blue+Valances?utm_term=winnett-blue-light-filtering-valance-curtain-three-posts"><img alt="winnett-light-filtering-50-curtain-valance-three-posts-color-blue-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/winnett-light-filtering-50-curtain-valance-three-posts-color-blue-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried the Winnett Light-filtering 50 Curtain Valance, and it was quite an experience. The blue shade added a touch of elegance to my living room, and the tailored design caught everyone's eye. I especially loved how the fretwork motif spruced up my plain window. 

However, the fabric was a bit rough, and getting rid of the wrinkles before hanging wasn't easy. It also turned out to be a bit see-through when the sun was shining bright, but it looked better with the blinds closed or during the night. 

Despite these cons, I found the curtain valance to be a reasonably priced addition to my living room decor. Overall, the Winnett Light-filtering 50 Curtain Valance was a decent purchase, but it could use some improvements in terms of fabric and see-through issues.

However, the curtain measurements and plaid pattern made for a unique and eye-catching addition to my walls.

In terms of care, the instructions clearly stated that the curtains should be machine-washed, which made for a hassle-free cleaning process. 

Overall, the Country Farmhouse Buffalo Plaid Valance brought a touch of country charm to my urban living space.
