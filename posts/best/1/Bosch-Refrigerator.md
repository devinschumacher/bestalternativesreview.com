<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Bosch+Refrigerator?utm_term=bosch-built-in-bottom-freezer-refrigerator-36-flat-hinge-b36bt935ns"><img alt="bosch-benchmark-built-in-bottom-freezer-refrigerator-36-flat-hinge-b36bt935ns-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bosch-benchmark-built-in-bottom-freezer-refrigerator-36-flat-hinge-b36bt935ns-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the opportunity to try out the Bosch Benchmark Built-In Bottom Freezer Refrigerator, and let me tell you, it has definitely lived up to its reputation. The first thing that stood out to me was the capacity of this refrigerator - it's a game changer. 

One of the highlights for me was the bright LED lighting that made it easy to navigate through the contents of the fridge without any fuss. I also loved how it could be built fully flush-mounted without damaging surrounding cabinetry, thanks to its Optiflex hinge. It just made everything look so sleek and stylish in my kitchen. 

However, there were a couple of cons as well. I found the design of the chiller drawer to be a bit complicated and awkward - it required the use of nose head pliers to remove it. I couldn't help but wonder if Bosch might have thought about a more user-friendly approach. 

Another little hiccup I faced was with the built-in ice maker. After noticing that water was freezing in the ice storage box, I contacted Bosch for a replacement part. The problem was, the part was on back order, and I had to wait for weeks to get it. It felt like a bit of a customer service letdown. 

Nonetheless, the Benchmark Series refrigerator truly delivered on its promise of being a top-class kitchen solution. Despite the minor hiccups, I found it to be a reliable and efficient appliance. It effortlessly kept food fresh and prevented the transfer of flavors or odors. With Home Connect app compatibility, I could monitor and control my fridge from anywhere. All in all, it was a positive experience, and I would highly recommend this refrigerator to anyone in the market for a new one.

### [Bosch 20.8 Cu ft French Door Stainless Steel Refrigerator](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Bosch+Refrigerator?utm\_term=bosch-20-8-cu-ft-french-door-stainless-steel-refrigerator)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Bosch+Refrigerator?utm_term=bosch-20-8-cu-ft-french-door-stainless-steel-refrigerator"><img alt="bosch-20-8-cu-ft-french-door-refrigerator-counter-depth-stainless-steel-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bosch-20-8-cu-ft-french-door-refrigerator-counter-depth-stainless-steel-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>
