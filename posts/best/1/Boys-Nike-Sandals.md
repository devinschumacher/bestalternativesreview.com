### [Nike Kids Kawa Slide - Comfortable Boys Sandals](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Boys+Nike+Sandals?utm\_term=nike-kids-kawa-slide-comfortable-boys-sandals)

I recently tried these Nike Kids Kawa Slide shoes, and I must say, they're a game-changer in the world of children's footwear. Coming from someone who's used shoes that don't seem to be designed for all-day wear, these Kawa Slides have truly exceeded my expectations! 

The first thing that caught my attention was the soft, synthetic strap that hugs the foot, providing all-day comfort. It feels like a gentle massage with every step, thanks to the injected Phylon midsole. The lightweight outsold foam is perfect for all-day wear, especially when I'm on my feet for longer periods. 

Another feature that stood out was the simple slip-on design. With kids, we can always use a break from laces, and these slides come in handy when I'm in a hurry or when they've grown tired of their regular shoes. Plus, the padded, silky soft fabric strap lining ensures a snug fit without causing any discomfort. 

However, there's one thing I couldn't ignore - the quality issues. Despite having a high rating on major platforms, there's no denying that there have been some durability issues for a few users. Although I haven't experienced it firsthand, it's always a concern when reliability comes into play. 

Overall, the Nike Kids Kawa Slide is a modern wardrobe essential for kids who love the ease of slip-on shoes. With its lightweight, durable design and comfortable fit, these shoes are a perfect addition to any child's everyday wear. Just remember to double-check the size and ensure they're snug enough to prevent any slipping.

### Which Boys Nike Sandals are best for everyday wear?

The Nike Air Zoom Rookie 2 is a popular choice for everyday wear. It's durable, comfortable, and offers great traction. The Nike Air Zoom Pulse 9 is another great option, providing excellent cushioning and protection for active boys. Both sandals are designed with versatile features that make them suitable for various activities.

This shoe is perfect for boys who spend a lot of time running or playing outdoors. Overall, these three options offer great value for money and are suitable for everyday wear for boys. 


### Are Nike Boys Sandals waterproof?

Most Nike Boys Sandals are not waterproof, as they are designed primarily for daily wear and activities on dry land. However, some options, such as the Nike Air Zoom Pulse 9, do offer some level of water resistance due to their durable upper material. If you're looking for Waterproof options, you might want to consider other brands like Columbia or Adidas.

### What size should I get for my son?

When purchasing Nike Boys Sandals, it's crucial to consider your child's foot size and growth rate. You should measure your child's foot length, ideally at the end of the day when their feet are at their largest, and compare it to the shoe's size chart to ensure a proper fit. Some of Nike's sandals offer half sizes, making it easier to find the perfect fit. 

As a rule of thumb, allow about half an inch of space between your child's longest toe and the front of the shoe for a comfortable fit. It's also essential to ensure that the sandal provides enough support and room for growth. If you're unsure about your child's shoe size, consider consulting a footwear specialist or visiting a store where you can try on different sizes before making a purchase. 


### What are the benefits of buying Nike Boys Sandals?
