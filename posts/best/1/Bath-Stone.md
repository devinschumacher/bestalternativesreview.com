### [Cozy Earth Instant Drying Bath Stone - Slate](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Bath+Stone?utm\_term=cozy-earth-instant-drying-bath-stone-slate)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Bath+Stone?utm_term=cozy-earth-instant-drying-bath-stone-slate"><img alt="cozy-earth-instant-drying-bath-stone-slate-dorai-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cozy-earth-instant-drying-bath-stone-slate-dorai-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Recently, I had the pleasure of trying the Cozy Earth Instant Drying Bath Stone from Dorai. With diatomaceous earth as its primary material, this bath mat felt like a natural stone, providing a touch of luxury to my daily routine. The main highlight of this product was its ability to instantly remove water, preventing mold and leaving my feet feeling dry. 

One pro of this product was the rubberized bottom pad, which helped prevent slipping and allowed for 360-degree drying. The mat was small in size which meant it could be easily placed in a semi-permanent spot in my bathroom. However, the mat didn't have the best traction and would occasionally shift around, which was a bit annoying. 

Another feature I really appreciated was its sleek design, which complemented the modern look of my bathroom. Even though it didn't have the most eye-catching colors, it looked stylish and didn't clash with my decor. 

One con I experienced was the fact that the mat stained very easily. After just a few uses, I noticed that the color of the mat started to change, which was quite disappointing. Despite its beautiful design, it wasn't truly durable. 

Overall, the Dorai Bath Stone mat provided an instant drying solution for wet feet and added a touch of elegance to my bathroom. While I appreciated the traction, sleek design, and instant drying capabilities, the staining issue remains a negative aspect of this product.

### [Dichab Bath Stone Nonslip Mat: Eco-Friendly Absorbent Diatomite for Shower and Kitchen](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Bath+Stone?utm\_term=dichab-bath-stone-nonslip-mat-eco-friendly-absorbent-diatomite-for-shower-and-kitchen)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Bath+Stone?utm_term=dichab-bath-stone-nonslip-mat-eco-friendly-absorbent-diatomite-for-shower-and-kitchen"><img alt="dichab-diatomaceous-earth-bath-mat-nonslip-bath-stone-mat-absorbent-quick-dry-diatomite-bathroom-mat-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/dichab-diatomaceous-earth-bath-mat-nonslip-bath-stone-mat-absorbent-quick-dry-diatomite-bathroom-mat-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

During a recent bathroom renovation, I stumbled upon the Dichab Diatomaceous Earth Bath Mat. It promised a nonslip, absorbent, and quick-dry experience, perfect for my slippery tiled floor. I noticed that the mat was made from eco-friendly diatom mud, which intrigued me. 

Right away, I appreciated the mat's ceramic-like texture, which was both visually appealing and comfortable underfoot. It truly felt like a porous ceramic surface, and the artificial pattern on its surface added a unique touch. However, I noticed the mat wasn't quite as effective as advertised in absorbing water. Despite having a nonslip design, the mat's surface remained slightly wetter after use. 

During my experience, I also found the mat to be fairly unpractical for someone used to standard bath mats. The rectangular shape was not very convenient for my bathroom layout, and the size of the mat was considerably larger than what I was used to. It took up more space than my previous bath mat, and I didn't appreciate the inconvenience. 

Lastly, I was disappointed to find out that the mat wasn't stain-resistant, a feature that's essential for a bath mat. I had to sand the mat regularly to avoid getting stains on it, which wasn't ideal. 

Overall, while the Dichab Diatomaceous Earth Bath Mat offered some unique features, its performance was not up to par. I appreciate the eco-friendliness, but the practicality and effectiveness of the matt left much to be desired.
