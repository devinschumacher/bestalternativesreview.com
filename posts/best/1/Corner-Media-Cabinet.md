Incorporating the Pottery Barn Aubrey Corner Media Base into my living space was an experience that left me impressed. The piece seamlessly blends traditional American style and modern functionality, a perfect combination for my home.

The quality of the wood was evident in the flawless surfaces, consistent color tones, and the absence of any cracking. The structural integrity of the product was guaranteed due to the use of FSC-certified wood and MDF. 

The frame-and-panel construction, along with the mortise-and-tenon joinery, added solidity and durability to the piece. The painted, glossy Dutch white finish on all sides was a beautiful touch, giving the media base a refined look.

Speaking of the shelves, the concealed glass doors add a touch of elegance to the stand. I'm a fan of how they keep the focus on the flat-screen and its surrounding AV equipment while still providing ample storage space. Plus, the brushed metal knobs on the doors really tie everything together. 

The stand's corner configuration does wonders in saving space, and the unit's cable pass-through feature made cable management a breeze. 

On the downside, the assembly instructions were far from perfect, and I found myself struggling to figure out where some pieces fit. It took me a bit longer than I'd like to admit to assemble the whole thing, but eventually, I got there. 

I also had to deal with a few missing hardware items, which made the installation process a little more complicated and frustrating than it should have been.

What stood out to me was the adjustable shelves, which held my audio/video equipment perfectly. The corner display shelves allowed me to show off some of my favorite home decor items. I appreciated the enclosed back panel with cord access, keeping things neat and tidy. However, the dimensions did require some thoughtful placement to ensure it worked well in my space. 

The product also featured two drawers with metal runners and safety stops that made accessing my storage items a breeze. The patented T-lock assembly system provided extra security and peace of mind. 

There were a couple of cons worth mentioning. The TV stand came with some small dings in the finish, which required a bit of touch-up work. For those of us with pets, the TV feet were uncomfortably close to the edges and could be a potential hazard. And although not a dealbreaker, some customers have pointed out that there could be a gap between the drawers in the center, which may seem unfinished. 

Overall, the Sauder Palladia Corner TV Stand, Vintage Oak was a lovely addition to my living room. The mix of pros and cons make it a worthwhile consideration for anyone in the market for a functional and stylish corner media cabinet.

First impression? It was a must-have! The wood material with the simple yet modern styling just fit perfectly into the corner of my living room. It also supported my TV quite well, which was an added bonus. 

But wait, there's more! This stand came with an electric fireplace insert. Now, I've had my fair share of stands with fireplaces, and I must say, the heating feature was surprisingly functional. However, it would benefit from a remote control. The flame could be switched on with or without the heat, but there was no mechanism to change the intensity or temperature. 

Assembly was a breeze, thanks to the instruction and hardware pack that came with it. It took me a few hours to finish, but it was well worth the time. The only hiccup was when I had trouble with a few stripping screws, but luckily, there were extras provided.

* Dimensions

* Materials and construction

### What are the benefits of purchasing a Corner Media Cabinet instead of a freestanding cabinet or wall unit?

A Corner Media Cabinet offers a unique combination of form and function. It provides a visually appealing and functional solution for storing and displaying electronic devices in small or awkwardly shaped rooms by utilizing otherwise unused or underutilized space.

If concerned about the installation process, consider a freestanding cabinet or a wall unit. While a freestanding cabinet requires no installation, it may not provide the same level of organization or style that a custom-built Corner Media Cabinet offers. Wall-mounted units can be installed quickly but lack flexibility in terms of room layout and may not be as space-efficient.
