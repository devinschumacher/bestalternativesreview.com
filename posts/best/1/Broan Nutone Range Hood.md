Plus, the hidden on/off rocker switches for controlling the fan speeds and LED light make it super convenient to use. 

But, like any product, it's not without its drawbacks. I was a bit disappointed to find that the mesh filters, while dishwasher-safe, can be quite delicate and may bend over time with regular use, especially during cleaning. It would've been great if the product included some instructions or tips on how to prevent this. 

Another minor issue was the remote operation. While it's ADA compliant, the specific UL approved wall switch wasn't included with the product, which added an extra step in getting it set up and running.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Broan+Nutone+Range+Hood?utm_term=broan-4136-stainless-steel-non-ducted-range-hood-with-charcoal-filter"><img alt="broan-4136-broan-4136-36-wide-steel-non-ducted-under-cabinet-range-hood-with-charcoal-filt-stainless-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/broan-4136-broan-4136-36-wide-steel-non-ducted-under-cabinet-range-hood-with-charcoal-filt-stainless-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the opportunity to try out the Broan 4136, and let me tell you, it's been quite the experience. As someone who appreciates beauty and functionality in their kitchen appliances, I must say the design of this range hood instantly caught my eye. The sleek, stainless steel finish not only looks magnificent but also ensures easy cleaning. 

The ability to adjust the fan speed using the rocker switch control has been a game-changer for me.

The separate rocker light switch is also a thoughtful feature that adds to the overall ease of use, making it a breeze to brighten up the cooking area with the attached incandescent light (though I did have to purchase the bulb separately). 

However, the inclusion of a replaceable charcoal filter is what really sets this range hood apart. It's been a lifesaver in terms of maintaining the air quality in my kitchen, as it effectively removes smoke and odors from the air. The non-vented design is also a great feature for those who don't want to worry about installing ductwork. 

That being said, the installation process was not without its challenges. While the instructions were clear enough, I found the hood to be somewhat less sturdy than I would have liked during assembly. I'd also like to note that the product is not ADA compliant, which could be a downer for some. 

In conclusion, the Broan 4136 is a range hood that combines style and functionality to create a kitchen appliance that I'm happy to have in my home. Although there were a few hiccups during assembly, the overall performance of the product has made it well worth the investment.
