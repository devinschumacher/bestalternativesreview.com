Leaning Horse Cabernet from California - an enticing mix of vintage and rich taste. The winemakers have put together something special that stands out in your glass. Every sip brings a unique blend of flavors, reminiscent of a sunny California afternoon. 

Sustainable practices were indeed put into place to grow these vines, and it pays off in the bottle. The grapes were nurtured from the ground up, with over 30 years of dedication to sustainable farming. This results in a wine that not only tastes delicious but also pays homage to the environment. 

While I found the wine itself to be quite enjoyable, there was a hitch. The delivery process seemed to have a bit of a snag. There were no issues with the product itself, but the communication and tracking of the delivery were lacking. This detracted from what was otherwise a pleasant experience. 

The Leaping Horse Cabernet is a bottle that not only celebrates the best of California's vineyards but also showcases the dedication of its makers. Despite the minor delivery issues, this wine is definitely worth trying out for its unique taste and the story behind it. So go ahead, pour yourself a glass and let the flavors of California take you on a journey.
