### How can I choose the appropriate size for a Boho Flush Mount Light?

Choosing the right size for a Boho Flush Mount Light depends on the room's dimensions, ceiling height, and personal taste. Generally, it's essential to consider the scale and proportions of the fixture in relation to the room's size. Larger rooms can accommodate larger lights, while smaller spaces may require smaller, more unobtrusive fixtures to prevent overcrowding the area. 

A few guidelines to follow include: 
1. For a centerpiece or a focal point, choose a light fixture that is approximately 1/2 to 2/3 the width of the room; 
2. Consider the height of the ceiling, as taller ceilings can accommodate larger fixtures without making the room feel cramped; and 3. Ensure the light has enough clearance from the adjacent walls and obstructions for optimal lighting and a comfortable atmosphere. If you're unsure, it's always a good idea to consult the product's user manual or a professional interior designer for advice on selecting the appropriate size for your Boho Flush Mount Light.

### What types of lighting technologies can be used in Boho Flush Mount Lights?

Boho Flush Mount Lights are available in various lighting technologies to meet different needs and preferences. Some popular options include:

The choice of lighting technology depends on your specific requirements, budget, and personal preference. LED bulbs are generally the most energy-efficient and cost-effective option, while halogen bulbs may be preferred for their ambient glow and longer lifespan compared to incandescent bulbs. Always check the compatibility of the light fixture with the bulb you intend to use, as not all flush mount lights are compatible with certain bulb types or voltage ranges.
