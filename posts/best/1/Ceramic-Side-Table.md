### [Murray White Ceramic Round Side Table - Threshold Designed by Studio McGee](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Ceramic+Side+Table?utm\_term=murray-white-ceramic-round-side-table-threshold-designed-by-studio-mcgee)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Ceramic+Side+Table?utm_term=murray-white-ceramic-round-side-table-threshold-designed-by-studio-mcgee"><img alt="murray-round-ceramic-end-table-white-threshold-designed-with-studio-mcgee-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/murray-round-ceramic-end-table-white-threshold-designed-with-studio-mcgee-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Murray Round Ceramic End Table, designed by Studio McGee for Threshold. It's a striking piece, with its charming cylindrical shape and unique indented bevel near the top. The white ceramic material gives it a warm, rustic vibe, and the speckled finish adds a touch of elegance to the design. 

The height of the table is perfect for placing next to a low sofa or chair, making it a practical and stylish addition to my living space. I appreciate that it's versatile enough to hold a coffee cup, books, or even serve as a decorative item for display. 

One thing I've noticed is the speckled finish might vary slightly from one unit to another. Some users have mentioned the presence of minor scratches and marks, but the majority of them were easy to remove with a magic eraser. The dip in the center is a design feature that gives the table its distinctive look. 

Based on my experience, I'd recommend heading to your local Target store to purchase this end table. While the product is beautiful, you'll want to see it in person before making your final decision. The price is quite reasonable, and I've found that the quality is worth it. 

Overall, I'm thrilled with my choice of the Murray Round Ceramic End Table. It's a unique and stylish addition to my home, and the craftsmanship and design are evident in every detail.

## Buyer's Guide

When it comes to enhancing the style and functionality of your living space, you can't go wrong with a ceramic side table. These versatile pieces not only add an aesthetic appeal to your room but also provide a practical solution for storage and display purposes. To help you make an informed decision when purchasing a ceramic side table, we've compiled this comprehensive buyer's guide. 


### Size and Shape Considerations for Ceramic Side Tables

Before making a purchase, consider the size and shape of the table that would best suit your needs. Ceramic side tables come in various shapes such as round, square, oval, or rectangular. The choice will depend on the space available in your room and whether you want to use the table for one person or multiple people. For smaller spaces, a round or square table might be more appropriate, while larger rectangular or oval-shaped tables are ideal for larger rooms or groups.

### Material and Weight

Ceramic side tables are generally lightweight and sturdy. They are made of high-quality ceramic materials that resist scratching and chipping. Ceramic tables also come in various colors, patterns, and finishes to match your room's decor. When making a purchase, consider the weight of the table and whether it will be easy to move around or not. Some ceramic side tables may have a heavy base, so make sure to choose one that is comfortable for you to handle. 


### Safety Features

Safety should always be a top priority when purchasing any type of furniture, including ceramic side tables. Look for tables with non-slip feet and a sturdy base to prevent accidents. Additionally, avoid placing sharp or heavy items on the table that can cause damage or injury. Some ceramic side tables also come with an anti-tipping safety device, which is especially helpful for families with small children.

### Maintenance and Care

While ceramic side tables are durable and resistant to wear and tear, proper maintenance and care are essential to ensure their longevity. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or harsh chemicals on the table, as they can damage the ceramic surface. Instead, use a soft cloth and mild soap solution to clean the table regularly. It's also recommended to place a coaster or mat under the table to protect the surface from stains and scratches caused by heat or moisture.

As mentioned earlier, ceramic is resistant to moisture and heat, which makes it ideal for high-traffic areas or rooms with frequent spills. This characteristic also makes it an excellent choice for outdoor use, where it can withstand various weather conditions without sustaining damage. 

The material is also non-porous, which means it doesn't absorb liquids and is easy to clean.

Do you prefer a more modern or classic design? Would you like a bold color or a more neutral tone? The right table for your home will depend on your personal taste and the existing aesthetic of your living space. 

Another important factor to consider is the size and shape of the table. Consider where you will place the table and how much space it will need.

### Are there any downsides to using ceramic for side tables?

While ceramic offers many benefits, it does have a few potential drawbacks. First, the material can be quite heavy, which may make it difficult to move around on your own. Additionally, some ceramic items may be more expensive than their counterparts made of other materials, such as wood or metal. This can be a consideration if you're on a tight budget. 

Lastly, while ceramic is highly durable, it can be prone to cracking or breaking if dropped or subjected to sudden impact. However, this risk can be minimized by choosing a well-made, high-quality ceramic table and taking care to handle it with proper care and caution. Overall, the advantages of using ceramic for side tables far outweigh any potential downsides, making it a popular choice for home furnishings. 


### Do all ceramic side tables come with a glass top?

Not all ceramic side tables come with a glass top, but many do. The decision to include a glass top is often based on the desired function and style of the table. Tables with a glass top are ideal for use as a surface for displaying items, as they provide a sleek and modern look that allows the underlying ceramic base to be seen. 

On the other hand, tables without a glass top may have a more rustic or traditional appearance, depending on the overall design of the piece. If you prefer the look of a bare, ceramic table or have specific requirements for your tabletop surface, make sure to verify if your chosen design includes a glass top before making your purchase.
