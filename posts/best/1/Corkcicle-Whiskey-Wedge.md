Maintaining the hygiene of your Corkcicle Wedge is a simple process made hassle-free. The whiskey wedge is safe for dishwasher cleaning and sanitization. When using a dishwasher, place it on the top rack to avoid any damage to its frozen gel center. However, hand washing remains an equally effective option. Use a soft sponge or cloth with warm water to achieve a thorough clean. Note that you should avoid using abrasive cleaners as they can damage the surface.


### Can I Use the Corkcicle Whiskey Wedge for Other Drinks, Such as Wine or Cocktails?

While the Corkcicle Whiskey Wedge is primarily designed for chilling spirits like whiskey, scotch, and bourbon, it can also be used to chill other drinks like wine and cocktails. Its sleek design allows it to fit neatly into tumblers and cocktail glasses of most sizes, fitting securely without any need for additional adapters or attachments.

However, for the best results, it is recommended to use the Whiskey Wedge with spirits, as the design guarantees optimal cooling efficiency and preservation of their distinctive flavors. For wine and cocktails, alternative chilling methods like ice cubes or a wine cooler might be more suitable to maintain the intended temperature and prevent dilution.

### What Size Do I Need to Choose for My Tumbler or Glass?

The standard size of the Corkcicle Whiskey Wedge easily fits most tumblers and large cocktail glasses. It measures approximately 3.5 inches in diameter and 1.2 inches in height, ensuring a secure and snug fit that provides efficient cooling without any additional adapters or attachments.

While the standard size is generally adequate, users with oversized tumblers or glasses with an unusual shape might consider using the Wedge in a smaller tumbler or glass to maintain optimal performance and fitting.


### How Long Does the Corkcicle Whiskey Wedge Last Before the Gel Melts?

Corkcicle Whiskey Wedge is engineered to keep the chill without compromising taste for a considerable duration. The gel core, derived from a unique blend of natural ingredients, works to maintain the drink’s temperature for up to two hours, depending on the size of your glass and the ambient temperature.

The gel core is designed to maintain its structure and integrity for an extended period; however, it will eventually melt and convert to liquid. To maximize the Whiskey Wedge's efficiency and longevity, we suggest using it in a smaller glass or tumbler, and opting for cold-proof glassware or double-walled tumblers can enhance its performance even further.
