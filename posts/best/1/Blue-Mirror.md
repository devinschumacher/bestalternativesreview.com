<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Blue+Mirror?utm_term=tstarer-blue-wave-dressing-tabletop-vanity-mirror"><img alt="tstarer-light-blue-wave-vanity-mirror-for-wall-mounted-dressing-tabletopdecorative-makeup-mirror-9-8-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tstarer-light-blue-wave-vanity-mirror-for-wall-mounted-dressing-tabletopdecorative-makeup-mirror-9-8-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Blue Lace Hanging Wall Mirror from Stonebriar Collection](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Blue+Mirror?utm\_term=blue-lace-hanging-wall-mirror-from-stonebriar-collection)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Blue+Mirror?utm_term=blue-lace-hanging-wall-mirror-from-stonebriar-collection"><img alt="stonebriar-collection-round-decorative-metal-lace-hanging-wall-mirror-blue-each-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stonebriar-collection-round-decorative-metal-lace-hanging-wall-mirror-blue-each-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Upon entering the Stonebriar Collection Round Decorative Metal Lace Hanging Wall Mirror, I was immediately captivated by its time-honored blue and brass frame. The rustic metal lace mirror sports a beveled glass mirror that boasts an incredibly clear reflection, making it an ideal enhancement for any living space in your home. 

The attached hanger streamlined the installation process, as all that was required was to secure it with a wall hook or screw (albeit, the necessary hardware was not provided, which can be considered a minor drawback). Sized at 12.5 inches in diameter, this mirror is a perfect fit for entryways, corridors, living rooms, and bedrooms, and its lightweight metal build enables hassle-free maneuvering. 

Despite a few customers commenting that the color might not be an exact match to the photo displayed online, my personal experience with the mirror was extraordinarily positive. It immediately infused the area with a touch of charm, and the antiquated charm of the frame made it a striking focal point. In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend the Stonebriar Collection Round Decorative Metal Lace Hanging Wall Mirror as an exceptional and aesthetic enhancement to your home furnishings.

I recently added this stylish 25.67-inch x 31.38-inch framed wall mirror to my bathroom decor. With its modern and flat frame face, it complements any design aesthetic. The solid wood frame, coated in a smart dark blue finish, adds a touch of elegance to the space. 

One feature I really appreciate is the large flat glass surface, which maximizes the viewing area and allows for a clear reflection. Mounting the mirror was a breeze, thanks to the three mounting rings attached to the back of the frame, making it easy to install either vertically or horizontally. 

While the mirror looks great and functionally works well in my space, I do feel the need for a tempered or safety glass might have been a better option for added protection against accidental falls. Overall, this framed wall mirror in blue is a great addition to my bathroom that adds a touch of style and functionality.

Of course, nothing is perfect. Although the included hardware made installation a breeze, some users might find it difficult to hang this relatively heavy mirror without the provided support. Nevertheless, the pros far outweigh the cons with this eye-catching addition to any room.
