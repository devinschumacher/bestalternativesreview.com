The Bluetooth connectivity can be extended up to 100 ft. , allowing you to connect your mobile device from a distance.

Although it can be a bit loud, the speaker's durability is impressive, featuring a metal grille and impact-resistant housing. To power the device, you can use Dewalt 12V Max, 20V Max, or Flexvolt batteries (all sold separately). It does come with a universal AC cord, and its small size makes it easy to carry around.

### [DeWalt Radio DC011: Best Portable Speaker for Music Lovers](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dewalt+Speaker?utm\_term=dewalt-radio-dc011-best-portable-speaker-for-music-lovers)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dewalt+Speaker?utm_term=dewalt-radio-dc011-best-portable-speaker-for-music-lovers"><img alt="dewalt-radio-dc011-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/dewalt-radio-dc011-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

In my daily life, I found the DeWalt Radio DC011 to be a convenient and portable companion. The weather-resistant design was a game-changer, as I didn't have to worry about using it outdoors. The dual pivoting 11" flexible antenna provided durable reception, making it easy to listen to my favorite radio stations. 

However, my experience was not without its challenges. The AM/FM Digital Tuner sometimes struggled, and the audio quality could be inconsistent, especially when switching between stations. Additionally, charging the battery packs required a bit of experimentation, as they were not universally compatible with all DeWalt battery packs. 

While there were a few minor drawbacks, overall, I believe the DeWalt Radio DC011 is a valuable addition to any toolbox or work site. It's a great companion for contractors, builders, and anyone looking for a dependable, portable radio with excellent sound quality. 


### [Dewalt Portable Digital Radio with Bluetooth and Charging Function](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dewalt+Speaker?utm\_term=dewalt-portable-digital-radio-with-bluetooth-and-charging-function)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dewalt+Speaker?utm_term=dewalt-portable-digital-radio-with-bluetooth-and-charging-function"><img alt="dewalt-dcr027-qw-one-size-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/dewalt-dcr027-qw-one-size-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I was recently introduced to the DeWalt DCR027-QW One Size radio, and it's been a game changer on my construction site. The sound is crystal clear, thanks to the combination of DAB+ and FM stereo, as well as powerful speakers complete with tweeter and woofer. It's perfect for those noise-free, interference-free moments on the job. 

What truly stands out is the sturdy housing, featuring a roll bar, cable storage, and a flexible antenna to ensure it's always ready for action. With my previous construction site radio, charging was a struggle, but no more with this versatile device. It's powered by mains connection, or a choice of 14.4, 18.0, and 54.0-volt XR Li-Ion batteries from DeWalt. And it has a handy charging function for all the mentioned batteries, making it a one-stop solution for power needs. 

Its tech box is a nice touch, keeping external audio devices safe and secure. It comes equipped with a 3.5 mm AUX input for playback, and a USB port for charging those same external audio devices. The Bluetooth feature is a fantastic addition to quickly connect with my mobile phone or MP3 player. 

The digital tuner is super handy, sporting an LCD display and station buttons. The LCD screen is clear and easy to read, even when donning rubber gloves, making this a user-friendly tool for every construction worker. The only downside is the weight of the device, but considering all its features, it's worth the extra lugging. However, when you consider it as a cost-effective solution, it makes the weight worth it. 

One of the main attractions for this device is its Bluetooth connection, which works wonders in streaming sound straight from my phone. But, a minor drawback is the Bluetooth signal is cut off when moving around corners. Nevertheless, there's a designated compartment to tuck your phone into safely, which is a much better option than having it out and about. 

Overall, the DeWalt DCR027-QW One Size radio is a fantastic addition to our construction site. The sound quality is top-notch, the Bluetooth connectivity is convenient, and its robust structure is built to withstand the everyday chaos of the job. It's a worthy investment for any construction site, workshop, or party room. 


### [Dewalt Worksite Portable Bluetooth Speaker](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dewalt+Speaker?utm\_term=dewalt-worksite-portable-bluetooth-speaker)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dewalt+Speaker?utm_term=dewalt-worksite-portable-bluetooth-speaker"><img alt="dewalt-worksite-radio-compact-multi-port-1-compact-radio-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/dewalt-worksite-radio-compact-multi-port-1-compact-radio-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The DEWALT compact radio, also referred to as a 'worksite radio' brings a lot more to the table than just a radio. This portable, versatile radio is compatible with DEWALT 18V and 20V MAX battery packs, which is a plus for those who prioritize convenience and seamless integration. The unit stands out for its USB charging port that allows device charging while it is plugged into an AC outlet, adding another layer of functionality to this compact radio. The built-in roll cage contributes to its portable nature and the sturdiness, making it a practical choice for different settings. 

However, there are areas where there is room for improvement as well. For one, this radio is not satellite radio-ready, limiting its reception capabilities. This little radio can be quite weighty, especially if considered in comparison to similar compact radio models. The preset button on the radio does not function as advertised which may prove to be an inconvenience for users. These could be factors potential users might want to weigh when considering making a purchase. 

There's also a word of caution that while it is durable, the display screen might be a bit flimsy and could get damaged easily – something one should be aware of if the radio is being used by a novice or someone who is careless about handling devices. Despite being marketed as a tool that is compatible with all DEWALT 18V & 20V MAX battery packs, it should be noted that it does not charge batteries. These small details, though seemingly minor, are still important considerations. 

In summary, while the DEWALT compact radio offers several notable features, it does fall short in a few aspects. However, these limitations might not necessarily be significant drawbacks depending on the specific needs of the user. All in all, it's a tool that offers good sound quality and is quite easy to use, making it a practical addition to any jobsite arsenal.

Dewalt ToughSystem Bluetooth Radio/Charger: My Experience

Ever heard of a speaker that doubles as a tool charger? Enter the DeWalt ToughSystem Bluetooth Music and Charger. I've been using this for a while now, and it has become my trusted companion on the jobsite. 

This is no ordinary speaker. Not only does it pump out great sound, thanks to those four full range tweeters and that singular subwoofer, but it also comes with its very own assistant bass resonator. Talk about power! Even more impressive? It's rated for an IP54, which means it's as dust-resistant as it is rugged. 

But what truly sets this apart is its versatility. This ToughSystem can run on a 12 V Max or a 20 V Max DeWALT battery, or it can be plugged in anytime. It's a great boon in terms of productivity, since it allows me to use the same battery as my power tools while still having my music ready. 

Connectivity options are aplenty. Bluetooth to stream from your phone, a 3.5 mm Aux input, and a USB charger - what more could you need? Plus, it's designed in a way that it can stack along with other ToughSystem modules if you've amassed a collection. 

And though it's a powerful piece of equipment, it's portable enough to carry around. You won't feel like you're lugging an elephant while moving around. As for the design, it's a bit of a love-hate situation. While it looks tough and robust, it could be a bit awkward to handle at times. 

One thing I found, though, was that the charging speeds could be faster. It takes a while to fill up the battery, which may be seen as a bit of a downside. But that's not to say it's not a useful feature. Charging has indeed been more convenient and less hassle, especially at the end of a tiring workday. 

This ToughSystem has had its fair share of flaws, but the positives far outweigh the negatives. It's a reliable, practical tool that's more than just an accessory. It's a companion on the job site, providing the much-needed motivation when the work gets tough. 

In conclusion, if you're a professional who also appreciates a good tune, this ToughSystem Bluetooth Music and Charger is well worth the investment. It may not be without its quirks, but it's certainly a tool worth having in your kit.

Overall, this device is an impressive addition to my toolbox, but some improvements could make it even more versatile and user-friendly.

The bonus of a 20-Volt MAX Lithium-Ion Battery Pack 3.0 Ah and Charger is a lovely touch from DEWALT. 

One of the things I love about this speaker is its portability. Its compact size and design allow me to easily carry it around wherever I need sound. Plus, the handle makes it convenient for me to hold my phone alongside while enjoying the tunes. 

However, I must admit that the volume control could be a bit more granular; it would make the volume adjustments more nuanced.

Overall, my experience with the DeWalt DCR010WDCB230C Bluetooth Speaker has been pleasant and seamless. It's a reliable and durable product that fits perfectly into my garage and daily life.

What caught my attention the most was its compatibility with smartphones - it's so convenient to have a speaker that seamlessly connects with my device without any hassle. Plus, it's incredibly lightweight, weighing in at just 39 grams, making it a breeze to clip onto my clothes for easy access.

### [Dewalt Lithium-Ion Jobsite Bluetooth Speaker](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dewalt+Speaker?utm\_term=dewalt-lithium-ion-jobsite-bluetooth-speaker)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dewalt+Speaker?utm_term=dewalt-lithium-ion-jobsite-bluetooth-speaker"><img alt="dewalt-lithium-ion-jobsite-bluetooth-speaker-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/dewalt-lithium-ion-jobsite-bluetooth-speaker-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Imagine you're on a construction site, surrounded by the noise of power tools and heavy machinery. You want to escape with some music, but regular wireless speakers are too fragile for such an environment. Enter the DeWalt Lithium-Ion Jobsite Bluetooth Speaker, a portable speaker designed specifically to withstand the toughest jobsites. 

First, let's talk about connectivity. This speaker is Bluetooth equipped, allowing it to connect to your device from up to 100 feet away. But what really sets it apart is its compatibility with DEWALT slide pack rechargeable batteries, including 12-Volt, 20-Volt, and FLEXVOLT. It also comes with an AC power cord, so you can keep the party going even when you're not on a job site. 

The speaker has a metal grille and an impact-resistant housing, which means it's built tough to handle the rigors of a busy construction site. It's not just about durability, though. This speaker delivers high-quality sound with dual speakers featuring extended bass. It's like having a small sound system right on your construction site. 

One of the features I love most is the integrated USB charging port. While you're enjoying your favorite tunes or podcasts, you can also charge your phone. It's a handy feature that you'll appreciate particularly if you're out in the field all day. 

However, there are a few things that I found not-so-great. For starters, the speaker did produce some distortion at high volumes after a few months of use. It's something to be aware of, especially if you plan on using it for longer periods at a time. 

Another point is the lack of a built-in radio. While it's not a deal-breaker for everyone, it might be worth considering if you're accustomed to traditional walkie-talkie or radio usage for communication. 

But overall, the DeWalt Lithium-Ion Jobsite Bluetooth Speaker is a well-designed, sturdy, and powerful device perfect for construction site use. It delivers excellent sound quality, and the convenience of charging other devices at the same time is a definite plus. While it may have a few cons, I think it's definitely worth it for the pros.

Our comprehensive guide covers all aspects of Dewalt Speakers, ensuring you have a well-rounded understanding of the category before making your decision.

### Sound Quality

The sound quality of a Dewalt Speaker is a critical factor to consider when making a purchase.

To protect against accidental drops or impacts, look for shock-absorbent features and reinforced corners.

The power and battery life of a Dewalt Speaker play a significant role in determining its performance. A powerful speaker delivers better sound quality, while longer battery life ensures you can use the speaker for extended periods without needing a constant power source.
