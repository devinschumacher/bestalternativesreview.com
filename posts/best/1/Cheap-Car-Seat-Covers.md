Plus, the neoprene padding provides a good balance of cushioning and waterproofing, so your seats stay clean and dry. 

However, the Spillguard Waterproof Rear Bench Car Seat Cover does have a few drawbacks. The seams aren't as tight as they could be, which means there's a little bit of wiggle room for dirt and spills to seep through.

Overall, though, I'd say this seat cover is a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to keep their car's seats in top shape. It's easy to install, provides good protection, and looks pretty stylish to boot. Just be aware of the seams and consider whether the gray stitching is the right color for you.
