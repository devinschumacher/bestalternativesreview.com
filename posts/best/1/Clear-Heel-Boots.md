A few weeks ago, I stumbled upon these stunning gold patent leather pointed toe ankle boots with a clear chunky heel. With the convenience of free returns, I decided to give them a try and see if they could spice up my everyday look. 

When I first put them on, I was impressed by how comfortable they felt, considering their height. The gold color added a touch of elegance and really made my outfits pop. 

However, the clear heel wasn't as eye-catching as I'd hoped. It seemed to blend in with the gold of the boot, making them look more casual than sophisticated. Overall, the boots proved to be a great addition to my wardrobe, but the clear heel wasn't as striking as I expected.
