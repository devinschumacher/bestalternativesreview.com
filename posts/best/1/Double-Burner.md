Overall, the Salton Double Burner Portable Cooktop is a reliable and convenient option to have when you need an extra burner for your kitchen. It's not perfect, but it gets the job done when you need it to.

However, the Elite Cuisine Electric Double Burner Hot Plate did have a few drawbacks. For one, its compact size meant it lacked the heft and stability that more substantial hot plates can offer. I noticed the plates moved slightly during my stir-fry prep, which was a bit disconcerting. 

Another issue I encountered was with the power cord. It was rather short, making the placement of the hot plate a bit problematic in my kitchen. This inconvenience, combined with the lack of storage space for the cords, made it a bit of a hassle. 

Despite these minor issues, I believe the Elite Cuisine Electric Double Burner Hot Plate would be a worthwhile addition to any home cook's arsenal. Its portability and the ease with which it can be cleaned make it an attractive option for apartment dwellers or anyone who loves to cook outdoors.

### Important Features

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Double+Burner"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Double-Burner-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Double-Burner-2" height="540"></a></div>

When considering a double burner stove, there are several key features you should look for to ensure you're getting the best product for your needs. These include materials, fuel type, heat output, and portability. Let's discuss each of these features in more detail below. 1. Materials: Double burner stoves are typically made of stainless steel or aluminum, which are both durable and lightweight materials. Stainless steel is highly resistant to rust and corrosion, making it a popular choice for outdoor cooking. Aluminum is also a lightweight and affordable option, although it may not be as long-lasting as stainless steel. 2. Fuel Type: Propane and liquid fuel are the most common fuel types for double burner stoves. Propane-powered stoves are more eco-friendly and generally easier to use, as the fuel is readily available. Liquid fuel stoves can be more challenging to use, as they require regular fuel adjustments. 3. Heat Output: The heat output is an important factor to consider, as it will determine how quickly your food cooks. Higher BTU ratings typically mean that the stove produces more heat. However, this can also mean the stove will consume fuel more quickly. 


### Considerations Before Purchasing

Before making a purchase, there are several factors you should consider. First, think about the type of cooking you plan to do with your double burner stove. For example, grilling burgers and hotdogs is different from making a stir-fry or simmering a stew. This will help you determine the fuel type and heat output you need. Next, consider the size and weight of the stove. A heavier stove may be more durable, but it could be more difficult to transport. Finally, think about any additional features you may want, such as a built-in thermometer or a removable warming plate.

Additionally, always use the appropriate fuel type for your stove and never overfill the fuel tank. 

Double burner stoves are a great investment for anyone who loves to cook or grill on the go. With a little research and consideration, you can find the perfect stove to suit your needs.

Cleaning a double burner depends on the type of burner and the materials used. For a gas double burner, turn off the gas, remove the burner from the stove, and let it cool down. Once cooled, use a soft cloth or sponge with warm, soapy water to clean the burner surface and grates. After cleaning, reassemble the burner and turn it back on. 

For electric and induction double burners, switch off the power, unplug the appliance, and let it cool down.

Additionally, read reviews and consider the feedback from other users to get a better understanding of the product's performance, durability, and maintenance requirements. Finally, consult the user manual to ensure the double burner you select meets your specific needs and adheres to safety standards during operation.

Regularly inspect your double burner for signs of wear and tear, such as rust, cracks, or damage to the heating elements.
