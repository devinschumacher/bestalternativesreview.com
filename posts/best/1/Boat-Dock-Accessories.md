The only drawback is that the mounting hardware is sold separately, which might be a hassle for some users. But overall, I'm really impressed with the value and the safety this product provides. It's worth every penny and I highly recommend it. 


### [Secure Dock Edge Leg Kit for Boat Stability](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Boat+Dock+Accessories?utm\_term=secure-dock-edge-leg-kit-for-boat-stability)

### [Anti-Corrosion 316 Stainless Steel Boat Cleat](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Boat+Dock+Accessories?utm\_term=anti-corrosion-316-stainless-steel-boat-cleat)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Boat+Dock+Accessories?utm_term=anti-corrosion-316-stainless-steel-boat-cleat"><img alt="kahaciyo-boat-cleat-open-base-4-5-inch-dock-cleat-316-stainless-marine-grade-steel-include-installat-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/kahaciyo-boat-cleat-open-base-4-5-inch-dock-cleat-316-stainless-marine-grade-steel-include-installat-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When I first tried the KAHACIYO Boat Cleat, I was drawn to its sleek and shiny appearance, reminiscent of the ocean's surface. Made of 316 stainless steel, it felt strong and sturdy in my hands. The multifunctional aspect was a pleasant surprise; not only did it work perfectly as a boat cleat, but it also served as a curtain tie and hook, adding versatility to its purpose. 

In my experience, the anti-corrosion materials truly made a difference. The 316 stainless steel was resistant to rust and weather, ensuring the cleat would last me a long time. The dock cleat's overall length of 3.89 inches was just right for securing my boat, and the individual wharf splints provided a nice touch to the overall design. 

One drawback, however, was the slight inconvenience during installation. Despite the included installation accessories, I found it a bit challenging to get everything aligned and secure. Nonetheless, the trade-off of a long-lasting, rust-resistant cleat with a polished mirror-like appearance seemed worth it in the end.

One of the most noteworthy features of this product is its ease of installation - a vital aspect in a product that you'll be using directly with water elements. 

However, its diminutive size might present some challenges, especially when trying to accommodate larger water pumps or machinery.
