I recently received the Toshiba 6-in-1 Inverter Microwave Oven Air Fryer Combo [Countertop Microwave](https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativesreview.com/blob/main/posts/best/1/Countertop-Microwave.md) and have been thoroughly impressed by its versatility and performance. This countertop appliance features a sleek black stainless steel finish that would easily blend with any kitchen décor. 

One of the standout features of this microwave is its healthy air frying function, which comes with ten preset menus. I found this to be especially convenient for those who want to enjoy the benefits of a crispy, fried food without the added fat and calories. Additionally, the convection broil and bake functions were perfect for making a variety of dishes, from crispy roasted vegetables to delicious homemade pizzas. 

Another great feature I loved was the combination of microwave heating with ten power levels, along with a keep warm function for [serving dishes](https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativesreview.com/blob/main/posts/best/3/Serving-Dishes.md) that needed to stay warm till the last minute without overcooking. The oven also came with an easy-to-read control panel, bright LED digital display, and a pro defrost by time, making it incredibly user-friendly and hassle-free. 

However, there were a couple of drawbacks as well. Firstly, the keypad was protected by a protection film during shipment, which I found out after opening the package. Secondly, the [turntable](https://github.com/devinschumacher/bestalternativesreview.com/blob/main/posts/best/3/Turntable.md) sometimes dragged while spinning, which could make cooking more challenging. 

Despite these minor issues, I believe the Toshiba 6-in-1 Inverter Microwave Oven Air Fryer Combo Countertop Microwave is an excellent investment for anyone looking for a multipurpose kitchen appliance. Its easy-to-clean stainless steel cavity, combined with its sleek design, makes it a great addition to any kitchen.

### How much counter space is required for an air fryer combo?

The counter space needed for an air fryer combo varies depending on the brand and model. Modern air fryer combos are designed to be compact and space-saving, making them suitable for small kitchens. For smaller footprints, consider purchasing a lightweight and minimally designed air fryer. 

A typical air fryer combo measures around 13-17 inches wide, 14-18 inches deep, and 11-15 inches tall. Before making a purchase, ensure that the appliance can comfortably fit on your available countertop space and that it is easy to maneuver around other kitchen appliances. 


### What are the best practices for cleaning and maintaining an air fryer combo?

To prolong the life of your air fryer combo and guarantee optimal performance, routine cleaning and proper care are essential. Always consult the manufacturer's instructions for specific cleaning guidelines. In general, cleaning your air fryer combo involves using warm, soapy water and wiping it dry with a soft cloth. 

Regular inspections and maintenance, including checking for loose wires or connections, inspecting the heating element and other components, and updating the air fryer to the latest software version (if prompted by the manufacturer), will help you enjoy consistently delicious meals and extend the appliance's lifespan.
