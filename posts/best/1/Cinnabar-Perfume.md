### [Cinnabar by Estee Lauder: Spicy, Long-Lasting Eau de Parfum for Women (1.7 oz)](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Cinnabar+Perfume?utm\_term=cinnabar-by-estee-lauder-spicy-long-lasting-eau-de-parfum-for-women-1-7-oz)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Cinnabar+Perfume?utm_term=cinnabar-by-estee-lauder-spicy-long-lasting-eau-de-parfum-for-women-1-7-oz"><img alt="cinnabar-by-estee-lauder-eau-de-parfum-spray-1-7-oz-for-women-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cinnabar-by-estee-lauder-eau-de-parfum-spray-1-7-oz-for-women-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I had the pleasure of trying Estee Lauder's Cinnabar Eau de Parfum recently, and let me tell you, it was quite a nostalgic experience. As someone who grew up with their mother's collection of scents, it's hard not to feel a bit sentimental when I come across a classic like this one. The warm, spicy fragrance of Cinnabar instantly took me back to the '70s, which was when my mother was in her prime. 

When it came to my first impressions, I must say that the top notes of this perfume really stood out. The spices, peach, cloves, bergamot, and tangerine all blended together to create a powerful, invigorating scent that was hard to ignore. But it wasn't just the initial burst of fragrance that impressed me - the heart notes of this perfume followed through, with a lovely blend of cinnamon, jasmine, ylang-ylang, rose, lily, and lily-of-the-valley that left me feeling refreshed and invigorated. 

As for the base notes, I found them to be a bit on the strong side, but that's not a bad thing, especially given how long-lasting this perfume is. The incense, vetiver, vanilla, benzoin, amber, patchouli, and sandalwood all worked together to create a powerful, lingering scent that I couldn't help but admire. 

However, there was a downside to this otherwise delightful experience. While the scent itself was lovely, I couldn't help but feel a bit overwhelmed by its strength. As someone who usually prefers more subtle fragrances, this was a bit much for me. Additionally, the perfume seemed to linger on my skin for far longer than I'd have liked, making it difficult to wash off at the end of the day. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I'd still say that Cinnabar by Estee Lauder is a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to add a touch of nostalgia to their scent collection. Its powerful, long-lasting fragrance will definitely make a statement, and I have no doubt that it will be a favorite among those who appreciate bold, warm scents.

The Eau De Parfum has a delightful combination of top notes such as spices, peach, cloves, bergamot, tangerine, and orange blossom, while middle notes consist of carnation, cinnamon, jasmine, ylang-ylang, and rose. 

The base notes include tolu balsam, sandalwood, amber, patchouli, benzoin, vanilla, vetiver, and incense, providing a long-lasting and intoxicating aroma. The body lotion offers a luxurious texture, enriched with the same captivating fragrance, resulting in an irresistible and sensual experience. 


### [Cinnabar Perfume Roll-On for Women - 1 oz Bottle](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Cinnabar+Perfume?utm\_term=cinnabar-perfume-roll-on-for-women-1-oz-bottle)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Cinnabar+Perfume?utm_term=cinnabar-perfume-roll-on-for-women-1-oz-bottle"><img alt="cinnabar-perfume-fragrance-l-ladies-type-size-1-oz-roll-on-bottle-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cinnabar-perfume-fragrance-l-ladies-type-size-1-oz-roll-on-bottle-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Experience the allure of Cinnabar Perfume Fragrance, a 1 oz Roll-On Bottle perfect for ladies who appreciate a touch of elegance. This product stands out for its high concentration of perfume oil, lasting longer on the skin compared to traditional fragrances. 

However, it's essential to note that this fragrance is more vintage and classic, as opposed to the designer alcohol perfume sprays often seen in modern advertisements. While it might not be a perfect match for the original Cinnabar, it offers a unique scent experience that can't be found in designer perfumes. 

Embrace the charm of perfume oils and indulge in the sophisticated world of Cinnabar Perfume Fragrance. 


### [Cinnabar Perfume Body Oil - Invigorating Ladies Fragrance Roll On](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Cinnabar+Perfume?utm\_term=cinnabar-perfume-body-oil-invigorating-ladies-fragrance-roll-on)

The Cinnabar Perfume Fragrance Body Oil Roll on is a unique addition to the fragrance market, offering a more concentrated and vintage experience. Pure body oils or perfume oils make up this product, with a fragrance concentration of 15-30%. The affordable price may be influenced by the fact that perfume oils aren't often associated with designer alcohol perfume sprays, but they still provide an enjoyable scent. 

However, the product might not be for everyone as it doesn't resemble the classic Cinnabar fragrance that some users have loved in the past. Despite this, the Cinnabar Perfume Fragrance Body Oil Roll on still offers a nice scent and an eco-friendly alternative, making it a decent choice for those looking for a different scent category.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Cinnabar+Perfume?utm_term=cinnabar-perfume-fragrance-luxurious-ladies-type-1-4-oz-dab-on-bottle"><img alt="cinnabar-perfume-fragrance-l-ladies-type-size-1-4-oz-dab-on-bottle-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cinnabar-perfume-fragrance-l-ladies-type-size-1-4-oz-dab-on-bottle-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Estee Lauder Cinnabar Exotic Perfume Set](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Cinnabar+Perfume?utm\_term=estee-lauder-cinnabar-exotic-perfume-set)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Cinnabar+Perfume?utm_term=estee-lauder-cinnabar-exotic-perfume-set"><img alt="estee-lauder-cinnabar-exotic-duo-set-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/estee-lauder-cinnabar-exotic-duo-set-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Cinnabar Ladies' 1 oz Cologne Spray Fragrance: Exquisite and Timeless Scent](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Cinnabar+Perfume?utm\_term=cinnabar-ladies-1-oz-cologne-spray-fragrance-exquisite-and-timeless-scent)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Cinnabar+Perfume?utm_term=cinnabar-ladies-1-oz-cologne-spray-fragrance-exquisite-and-timeless-scent"><img alt="cinnabar-perfume-fragrance-l-ladies-type-size-1-oz-cologne-spray-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cinnabar-perfume-fragrance-l-ladies-type-size-1-oz-cologne-spray-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Cinnabar Perfume promises a ladies-type fragrance with a hint of the classic scent. It comes in a cologne spray format, with the size being 1 ounce, making it suitable for occasional use. Although users claim to have wanted to love it, they found it falling short of the expectations as it didn't smell exactly like the Cinnabar they were previously familiar with. 

They still believe it is not a bad scent, just not the perfect replica. This perfume oil, which is more vintage and classic than many colognes, might be a good choice for those who appreciate a more 'timeless' scent. 

It's made from pure uncut body oil with a fragrance concentration of 15-30% and retails for a lower price due to its lack of designer status and glamorous packaging. Despite its limitations, it offers a distinct fragrance that could appeal to fans of more old-school colognes. 


### [Cinnabar Ladies Perfume: Bottle Type 1/8 DRAM dab-on](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Cinnabar+Perfume?utm\_term=cinnabar-ladies-perfume-bottle-type-1-8-dram-dab-on)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Cinnabar+Perfume?utm_term=cinnabar-ladies-perfume-bottle-type-1-8-dram-dab-on"><img alt="cinnabar-perfume-fragrance-l-ladies-type-1-8-dram-dab-on-bottle-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cinnabar-perfume-fragrance-l-ladies-type-1-8-dram-dab-on-bottle-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Last week, I spritzed on a dab of Cinnabar Perfume Fragrance. It was a lovely vintage scent that reminded me of days gone by, a delicate balance of cinnamon and vanilla that left a lasting impression on my skin. However, there was something missing – it seemed to fall just a little short of what I remembered. 

The best part about this perfume was its longevity, a testament to its perfume oil base. It was a great value considering the concentration of its fragrance. But, while the scent was pleasant, it just didn't capture the essence of the Cinnabar perfume I used to wear. 

On the downside, the bottle and its contents lack the glamour that designer perfumes often boast, which may not sit well with some customers. Overall, it's a nice fragrance, but it's not the right Cinnabar – and for that, I can't give it a perfect score. So, while Cinnabar Perfume Fragrance is a unique and affordable alternative, it's not the same as the one I know and love. 


### [Estée Lauder Cinnabar Indulgent 2-Piece Fragrance Set](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Cinnabar+Perfume?utm\_term=estée-lauder-cinnabar-indulgent-2-piece-fragrance-set)

Diving into the world of oriental exotic fragrances, I was allured by the Cinnabar Indulgent Duo Fragrance Set. As a lover of warm and spicy scents, this set seemed like a perfect match for my sensory preferences. The perfume, a full-size Eau de Parfum Spray, immediately captivated me with its captivating blend of oriental notes that wafted through the air like a mesmerizing enchantress. The accompanying Body Balm was equally delightful as a light, nourishing cream that delicately blended with the perfume's scent, perfecting my olfactory experience. 

Throughout my journey with the Cinnabar Indulgent Duo Fragrance Set, I found that the scent of the perfume and lotion was surprisingly subtle, yet still powerful enough to leave a lasting impression on others. The luxurious hand cream that accompanied the duo added an extra touch of indulgence, making it a gift set worthy of sharing with special friends and family. 

One downside I noticed was that the scent of the perfume was not as intense as I expected from the product description and reviews. However, the lotion and hand cream made up for it, providing a balanced combination of gentle fragrance and hydration. Overall, the Cinnabar Indulgent Duo Fragrance Set was a delightful addition to my collection of fragrances, and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking a subtly exotic scent with a touch of glamour.

### [Cinnabar Ladies Perfume - 4 oz Plastic Bottle](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Cinnabar+Perfume?utm\_term=cinnabar-ladies-perfume-4-oz-plastic-bottle)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Cinnabar+Perfume?utm_term=cinnabar-ladies-perfume-4-oz-plastic-bottle"><img alt="cinnabar-perfume-fragrance-l-ladies-type-size-4-oz-plastic-bottle-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cinnabar-perfume-fragrance-l-ladies-type-size-4-oz-plastic-bottle-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a fan of Cinnabar Perfume, I was excited to give this fragrance a try. The 4 oz plastic bottle made it easy to carry on the go and the size seemed just right. 

One of the first things that stood out to me was the scent itself. It had a slightly different fragrance than the original Cinnabar I knew and loved, but it wasn't bad by any means. I found the perfume oil to be quite long-lasting, which was a pleasant surprise and made it worth the investment. 

On the downside, the bottle's plastic material didn't feel as luxurious as I hoped, but it didn't affect the performance of the fragrance itself. Overall, this Cinnabar Perfume Fragrance had its pros and cons, but if you're looking for a different spin on the classic scent, it's worth a try. 


### [Cinnabar Delight Ladies Perfume Spray (2 oz)](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Cinnabar+Perfume?utm\_term=cinnabar-delight-ladies-perfume-spray-2-oz)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Cinnabar+Perfume?utm_term=cinnabar-delight-ladies-perfume-spray-2-oz"><img alt="cinnabar-perfume-fragrance-l-ladies-type-size-2-oz-cologne-spray-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cinnabar-perfume-fragrance-l-ladies-type-size-2-oz-cologne-spray-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried the Cinnabar Perfume Fragrance, and it left quite an impression on me. The size of the cologne spray was perfect for my needs, and the scent was quite distinctive. However, I have to admit that it didn't quite capture the essence of the Cinnabar I used to wear. It wasn't necessarily a bad scent, but it just didn't quite match my expectations. 

One feature that stood out was the fact that the perfume oil has a higher fragrance concentration, which means it lasts longer on the skin compared to traditional colognes. It's a great value for the money, but the lack of status and glamorous packaging might be a downside for some people. 

Overall, I'd say it's worth trying out if you're looking for a unique scent with a vintage feel. It might not be the perfect match for the original Cinnabar, but it certainly has its own charm.

Alternatively, you can apply a few drops directly onto your skin or clothing, which can also create a long-lasting and memorable scent experience.
