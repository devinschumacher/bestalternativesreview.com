The features that really stood out to me were its airtight seal and swivel casters.

The swivel casters on the other hand make it easy to move the container around, whether I'm cooking in my backyard or taking it on a camping trip. 

Now, I will admit that there were a couple of hiccups along the way. For starters, the scoop mentioned in the product description was not included in my order. After speaking with customer support, I learned that the scoop was separate and would need to be ordered separately. Additionally, the container's dimensions, while great for my needs, did take up a significant amount of space in my garage. 

All in all, I'd recommend this Iris USA Weatherpro Airtight Charcoal, Pellet, or Pet Food Storage Container to anyone in need of a reliable and durable solution for their charcoal and pellet storage needs. With its airtight seal and handy casters, it's made all the difference in my outdoor cooking experience.

Its stackable design makes it an ideal space-saver in any pet owner's home or garage. 

However, the container's lid can sometimes be difficult to tighten and open smoothly, and some users have reported inconsistencies in the product's manufacturing, such as imperfections in the lid opening. The 18-inch length and 14.2-inch width of the container also make it a bit larger than some might expect, so proper stacking support is needed to prevent toppling.

In summary, I'm content with this container, as it has significantly enhanced my pet food storage experience.


### [Pet Food Smart Storage Container 50 Lbs - Stackable, Seal & Purr](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dog+Food+Container+50+Lbs?utm\_term=pet-food-smart-storage-container-50-lbs-stackable-seal-purr)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Dog+Food+Container+50+Lbs?utm_term=pet-food-smart-storage-container-50-lbs-stackable-seal-purr"><img alt="bergan-pet-food-smart-storage-large-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bergan-pet-food-smart-storage-large-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I was intrigued to try out this Bergan Pet Food Smart Storage Large, mainly because it's large and claims to be air tight - perfect for our furry friends who love to dig in and spill their food! The blue color really does stand out in our pantry, making it easy to spot among other containers. But oh, the issues we faced. . 

Firstly, the gasket seals were a real concern. We were hoping to keep the food fresh for longer without any unwanted guests, like ants. Unfortunately, they just didn't seal well enough, leading to a few pests making their way into our dog's food. It was a frustrating experience to say the least. 

However, we found that the large top opening did make a big difference when it came to filling up the container without creating a mess. It was quite handy. But it's also worth mentioning that the stackable design took up quite a bit of space. While it was convenient to have multiple containers that could stack on top of each other, it still required a good amount of room. 

The one-handed access and ease of scooping or pouring was a bonus for sure. But as we began to notice the flimsy plastic construction, we became more hesitant. It's hard to trust a product that doesn't seem to be built to last. 

On a positive note, the container is lightweight, making it easy to lift and move around. However, it did leave us wondering if it could really hold up to 50 lbs of pet food. Overall, it's got its pros and cons, but our experience with it wasn't as smooth as we hoped.

I've been using the Iris Airtight Pet Food Container to store my beloved cat, Chowder's, dry food. The features that stood out to me were the airtight seals that keep moisture and pests out, ensuring freshness for our little feline friend. I also appreciated the snap latches that securely lock the lid, providing a good seal. 

One thing that made my life easier was the tapered shape and wide top, which allowed me to scoop out Chowder's food with ease. The container comes in four sizes, catering to the most popular bag sizes for dry pet food. The two larger sizes even roll on four free-wheeling casters, making it a cinch to move around. 

Although I've had no issues with the airtight container, I did notice the plastic isn't super durable. However, it has managed to hold up well for about six months, so it's a reasonable trade-off for the price. Additionally, the wheels seem to be doing the job just fine, even though the floor in my utility room can be a bit uneven.

Additionally, the scooper was too large for my needs, but it could be a great feature for larger dogs or cats. 

In terms of cleaning, the container was easy to clean by hand, but I was disappointed to learn that it wasn't dishwasher safe. This would be a minor inconvenience for pet owners who might want to sanitize their food containers more frequently.
