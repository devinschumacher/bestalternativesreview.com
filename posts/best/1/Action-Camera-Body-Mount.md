### [Wiral Action Camera Mount for Cable Cam System](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Action+Camera+Body+Mount?utm\_term=wiral-action-camera-mount-for-cable-cam-system)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Action+Camera+Body+Mount?utm_term=wiral-action-camera-mount-for-cable-cam-system"><img alt="wiral-action-camera-mount-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/wiral-action-camera-mount-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Wiral Action Camera Mount in my daily life, and let me tell you, it's a game-changer. Mounting my action camera to the Wiral LITE cable cam system has never been easier. The mount attaches securely to the bottom of the LITE with its 1/4 inch-20 thread, and the camera fits perfectly onto the three-prong action mount, which is also attached with a simple thumbscrew. 

One of the coolest features of the mount is its compatibility with any action camera brand that has a standard three-prong mount, such as GoPro, Garmin, and Kitvision. This means I'm not limited to just one brand of camera; it's great for the versatile photographer! Plus, the 1/4 inch-20 thread at the bottom can also be used with a tripod or other mount, which is an added bonus for those who already have a collection of mounting gear. 

Although I haven't had a lot of time to explore all the accessories included in the package, I've already noticed the benefit of the Wiral Smartphone Mount With Damper. It provides a stable attachment for my smartphone while using my action camera, which has been a lifesaver for those spontaneous shots. 

Overall, the Wiral Action Camera Mount has been an excellent addition to my Wiral LITE cable cam system, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to take their action camera game to the next level.

### [PellKing Mobile Phone Action Camera Body Mount Holder for Samsung and iPhone](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Action+Camera+Body+Mount?utm\_term=pellking-mobile-phone-action-camera-body-mount-holder-for-samsung-and-iphone)

But, there's always a little room for improvement. While the chest mount is compatible with multiple devices, I noticed that the mounting type can be a bit tricky to set up. It requires a single screw to hold the weight of the phone, which might reduce its lifespan over time. 

Overall, I'm really happy with my experience using the PellKing Mobile Phone Chest Mount Harness Strap Holder Cell Phone Clip Action Camera POV. It's a versatile and affordable option for anyone who wants to capture their adventures from a whole new perspective.

### Compatibility

It's indispensable to ensure the mount you opt for is compatible with your particular action camera model. Since some action cameras have distinct mounting systems or varying thread sizes, compatibility is paramount. Consult the manufacturer's guidelines to ascertain compatibility before making a purchase.
