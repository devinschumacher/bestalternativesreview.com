### [Discovery Kids RC Tarantula with Infrared Remote Control](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Discovery+Toys?utm\_term=discovery-kids-rc-tarantula-with-infrared-remote-control)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Discovery+Toys?utm_term=discovery-kids-rc-tarantula-with-infrared-remote-control"><img alt="discovery-kids-remote-control-tarantula-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/discovery-kids-remote-control-tarantula-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Discover Artistic Talent with the Discovery Kids Art Tracing Projector - Blue](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Discovery+Toys?utm\_term=discover-artistic-talent-with-the-discovery-kids-art-tracing-projector-blue)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Discovery+Toys?utm_term=discover-artistic-talent-with-the-discovery-kids-art-tracing-projector-blue"><img alt="discovery-kids-art-tracing-projector-kit-blue-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/discovery-kids-art-tracing-projector-kit-blue-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Last weekend, I introduced my daughter to the Discovery Kids Art Tracing Projector Kit in her favorite shade of blue. She was so excited to start using it that she immediately grabbed a stencil and started drawing! The moment the projected image appeared on the paper, she jumped right in, tracing and coloring away with the provided markers. 

One of the coolest features of this kit is how easy it is for kids to draw like professionals. My daughter had been struggling with her drawing skills, but once this projector kit came into her life, it helped her develop her ability in no time. The set comes with plenty of image options, so her creativity has been flourishing all week! 

Another highlight of the kit is its portability. It easily folds up into a neat little package that's perfect for carrying and storing all of the tools in one place. Plus, the fact that it uses LED lights and requires just 3 AA batteries also makes it energy-efficient and environmentally friendly. 

However, let me be honest about the product's minor drawbacks. I wish the markers were a bit more vibrant, as the colors seemed to fade a bit when applying the tracing stencils. And, it would've been nice if the manufacturer included extra stencils in a variety of shapes and sizes, as there were just a few to choose from. 

All in all, though, this tracing projector kit by Discovery Kids has been providing my daughter with hours of fun and fostering her creative talents. So, if you're looking for a unique and engaging art project for your little ones, this product is definitely worth checking out!

### [Discovery Toys: Giant Pegboard - Entertaining Learning Toy](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Discovery+Toys?utm\_term=discovery-toys-giant-pegboard-entertaining-learning-toy)

Say hello to the star peg with rattle beads - a sensory surprise that makes it multifunctional!

You can form shapes, letters, and numbers on the board, not to forget, you can even learn how to count and measure areas! 

But the magic doesn't stop there. Flip the board over, and add rubber bands to explore polygon, congruent, and symmetrical shapes. There's so much more visualization to do with points, lines, and angles. The pegboard opens new avenues to learn about geometry and spatial comprehension. 

And if that was not exciting enough, there's also an intriguing activity guide included with the pegboard. It's in both English and French, making it a global playtime companion. Just remember, the rubber bands are not safe for kids under 3. It's a game changer from 19 months and onwards. 

In my hands-on experience with the Discovery Toys Giant Pegboard, I could observe the potential for developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills through pattern play. Even a toddler could master the skills! 

I've never met a peg toy that's this versatile, fun, and educational, making it hands down a worthwhile and engaging purchase.

A few weeks ago, I stumbled upon this Discovery Kids Toy Tent Inflatable Dome while browsing through my local toy store. Being a mom, I couldn't resist giving it a try for my little one. Assembling the tent was such a breeze - it took no time at all, thanks to the no-pole design. The tent quickly inflated to a spacious size, big enough for parties and sleepovers. My daughter and her friends spent hours inside, playing and imagining different scenarios. 

The safety mesh divider and no floor design were thoughtful touches that gave me peace of mind when letting her play inside. The adhesive fan tabs kept the fan secure without causing any damage to the tent. And let's not forget about the easy travel storage tote included - it made cleanup a breeze.
