### [Manfrotto Advanced Travel DSLR and Laptop Backpack](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Camera+Travel+Backpack?utm\_term=manfrotto-advanced-travel-dslr-and-laptop-backpack)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Camera+Travel+Backpack?utm_term=manfrotto-advanced-travel-dslr-and-laptop-backpack"><img alt="manfrotto-advanced-travel-backpack-iii-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/manfrotto-advanced-travel-backpack-iii-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the opportunity to try the Manfrotto Advanced Travel Backpack III and thought I'd share my experience using it as a photographer on the go. The backpack is designed to carry personal items and a range of camera equipment, making it a great option for those on the move. 

The first thing I noticed was the compact size of the backpack, which made it easy to navigate in crowded areas, perfect for capturing candid moments. It has a decent size of 14L overall, so it can accommodate both personal and camera gear with ease. 

One of the highlights of this backpack is the side-mounted tripod storage â€“ a feature that I found really useful. The bag can also accommodate a 15-inch laptop with a padded compartment for protection, which is a great advantage for those who need to work on the go. 

However, the swing-to-one-shoulder-to-access feature was not as smooth as I anticipated. This required a bit more effort than I expected, and I ended up having to set down to access the gear, which was a bit inconvenient on the go. 

Another area that could be improved is the access side to your camera. There's only one access side on the side of the backpack, so you might need to reorganize your gear before going out to make sure everything is easily accessible. 

Overall, the Manfrotto Advanced Travel Backpack III is a great option for photographers and videographers on the move, though there were a few features I found could be smoother for on-the-go shooting. With a bit of organization and a bit of practice, I'm sure you could make the most of this backpack in your daily life.

### [Manfrotto Advanced Camera Travel Backpack III](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Camera+Travel+Backpack?utm\_term=manfrotto-advanced-camera-travel-backpack-iii)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Camera+Travel+Backpack?utm_term=manfrotto-advanced-camera-travel-backpack-iii"><img alt="manfrotto-advanced-befree-backpack-iii-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/manfrotto-advanced-befree-backpack-iii-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a travel photographer, I am always on the lookout for a backpack that can handle all my gear and still be comfortable to wear. Manfrotto's Advanced Befree III has been a game-changer for me. Designed for versatility, this backpack can easily transform from a camera bag to a laptop bag or a daypack. It's perfect for my needs, but I've noticed that it's not always the best fit for everyone. 

One of the standout features of this backpack is its modular design. I love how easily it can be customized to fit my gear, regardless of whether I'm carrying a camera, a laptop, or just my everyday essentials. The exterior pockets provide easy access to smaller items, and the hidden pockets on the back are a great security feature. 

However, I've also encountered some issues with the Advanced Befree III. The zipper closure can be finicky at times, making it a bit of a hassle to open and close the backpack. Additionally, while it's made to accommodate a 15-inch laptop, it doesn't quite fit a 16-inch MacBook Pro as snugly as I'd like. 

Overall, the Manfrotto Advanced Befree III is an excellent choice for someone like me who needs a backpack that can handle both photography gear and a laptop. While there are a few minor drawbacks, the pros definitely outweigh the cons. Just be sure to check the dimensions before making a purchase to ensure it's the right fit for you.

As a photography enthusiast, I recently stumbled upon the BAGSMART Camera Backpack and decided to give it a go on one of my weekend outdoor shoots. The waterproof feature caught my eye, especially after experiencing some unfortunate rain surprises with other camera bags. 

The shock-absorbing bottom and padded dividers offered a sense of reassurance when carrying my delicate SLR equipment. The backpack's large storage capacity was more than sufficient to fit my laptop up to 15 inches, along with two lenses and additional photography accessories. 

However, I did notice a couple of drawbacks during my experience. I felt like the shoulder straps could have been more comfortable, as they caused a slight strain after carrying the backpack for extended periods. Additionally, securing the backpack firmly to my luggage handle seemed quite challenging, making it a bit of an inconvenience when traveling. 

Even with these minor downsides, the BAGSMART Camera Backpack proved to be a solid addition to my photography gear collection. Its combination of waterproofing, spacious camera storage, and the unique features of the padded dividers and the locking zips make it a worthwhile investment for any photography professional or enthusiast.
