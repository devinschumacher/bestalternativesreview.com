### [Officially Licensed Tar Heels Rotary Queen Bed In A Bag Set](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Collegiate+Bedding?utm\_term=officially-licensed-tar-heels-rotary-queen-bed-in-a-bag-set)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Collegiate+Bedding?utm_term=officially-licensed-tar-heels-rotary-queen-bed-in-a-bag-set"><img alt="north-carolina-tar-heels-full-bed-in-a-bag-set-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/north-carolina-tar-heels-full-bed-in-a-bag-set-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently came across the North Carolina Tar Heels Full Bed in A Bag Set, and it instantly caught my attention as a college basketball fan. The licensed bedding set is perfect for any Tar Heel fan's dorm or bedroom. It includes a beautiful comforter, complete with the team's name and logos, and a matching set of sheets and pillowcases. 

One of the highlights of this set is its soft and cozy feel. It's like snuggling up under your favorite blanket while dreaming about your favorite team's victory. The machine washable feature is a bonus, making it easy to clean and maintain. 

However, I did experience a small issue with the slickness of the sheets, which occasionally caused them to pull off the corners of the mattress. Despite this minor inconvenience, I would still recommend this set to any Tar Heel fan looking to add a touch of their team spirit to their sleep. 


### [Modern Clemson Tigers Twin Comforter Set](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Collegiate+Bedding?utm\_term=modern-clemson-tigers-twin-comforter-set)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Collegiate+Bedding?utm_term=modern-clemson-tigers-twin-comforter-set"><img alt="clemson-tigers-modern-take-twin-comforter-set-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/clemson-tigers-modern-take-twin-comforter-set-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently picked up this Clemson Tigers Modern Take Twin Comforter Set to add a personal touch to my son's dorm room. The first thing that caught my eye was the bold, repeating print of our beloved team on the comforter. It features a shiny PVC logo with metallic accents. While it adds a sense of school spirit, I must say the shiny surface isn't the most practical choice for a dorm room setting. 

The comforter itself is lightweight, which means it's easy to move around or even travel with. However, it's a bit thinner than I would have liked, especially for the cooler temperatures in autumn and winter. I would recommend pairing it with another blanket for extra warmth. As for the sham, it matches the comforter's color scheme and material. 

One of the highlights of this set is the adjustable padded shoulder straps and mesh back panel, which makes it easier to carry the comforter when changing rooms or beds. The compartments are useful for storing clothes or small personal items within close reach. 

Overall, I'm happy with my purchase, but I would have preferred a thicker comforter and perhaps a different surface finish. My son still loves the vibrant colors and the sense of pride it brings to his dorm space, so for this reason, it gets a solid 4 out of 5 stars. 


### [NCAA Texas Longhorns Collegiate Twin Sheet Set](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Collegiate+Bedding?utm\_term=ncaa-texas-longhorns-collegiate-twin-sheet-set)

The set comes with a soft and cozy 64"x 86" comforter and a 24"x 30" sham, both made of 100% Polyester Fiber. The feel is exceptionally warm and snug, making it an ideal companion for those chilly winter nights. 

However, the set requires some maintenance to keep its vibrant colors intact. Regularly fluff the comforter to maintain its shape and wash it using the appropriate detergents to protect the colors from fading. Nonetheless, this minor concern does not diminish the enjoyment derived from using this cozy and vibrant comforter and sham set. 

In conclusion, the Alabama Crimson Tide Hexagon Twin Comforter & Sham Set is a perfect blend of comfort, style, and team spirit. It's the ideal accessory for any college football fanatic looking to enhance their bedtime routine.

Although the sizing might be a bit small for some, the overall quality of the set is impressive.

### [North Dakota State University Bison Hexagon Twin Comforter Set](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Collegiate+Bedding?utm\_term=north-dakota-state-university-bison-hexagon-twin-comforter-set)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Collegiate+Bedding?utm_term=north-dakota-state-university-bison-hexagon-twin-comforter-set"><img alt="north-dakota-state-bison-hexagon-twin-comforter-sham-set-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/north-dakota-state-bison-hexagon-twin-comforter-sham-set-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid sports fan and college alumnus, I recently stumbled upon this adorable North Dakota State Bison 'Hexagon' Twin Comforter & Sham Set by The Northwest Group, LLC. The combination of the modern, bold design inspired by my alma mater's logo and the super cozy, soft feel of the 100% polyester comforter shell and sham had me excited to give it a try. 

Upon opening the set, I was impressed by the detailed attention to the design – the repeating print of the college logo and the established date on the comforter and sham. Not only did it make my room feel more personal, but it also added a fun pop of color to my otherwise neutral bedroom. Additionally, the set was easy to match with other Bison-themed decor in my dorm room. 

However, the comforter was slightly smaller than the typical twin size (64 in. x 86 in. ), and might not cover the entire bed properly in larger twin size beds, which could be a minor inconvenience for some users. Nonetheless, the overall experience of using this comforter set has been a delightful addition to my daily life, bringing school spirit and comfort into one lovely package.

Some college bedding is made from polyester, which can be a budget-friendly choice. Consider investing in bedding made from natural materials like organic cotton if you have sensitivity to synthetic fabrics. 


### Design options

Collegiate bedding comes in various designs to suit different preferences. You can choose from plain, solid colors or patterns such as stripes, checks, florals, or geometric designs. Some bedding sets also feature emblems or mascots of popular universities. When selecting a design, consider the color scheme of your room or the theme you want to create. Matching sets may include bedding, curtains, and other accessories for a cohesive look.
