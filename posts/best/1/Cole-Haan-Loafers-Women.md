<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Loafers+Women?utm_term=cole-haan-womens-gold-loafer-size-11"><img alt="cole-haan-originalgrand-platform-venetian-loafer-gold-size-12" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cole-haan-originalgrand-platform-venetian-loafer-gold-size-12/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Cole Haan Blue Women's Cloudfeel Loafers](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Loafers+Women?utm\_term=cole-haan-blue-womens-cloudfeel-loafers)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Loafers+Women?utm_term=cole-haan-blue-womens-cloudfeel-loafers"><img alt="cole-haan-original-cloudfeel-meridian-womens-loafers-size-8-blue-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cole-haan-original-cloudfeel-meridian-womens-loafers-size-8-blue-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

After trying these Cole Haan loafers, a modern slip-on shoe designed to provide exceptional ventilation and moisture management, I was blown away by the level of comfort it offered. The dual-density EVA molded footbed felt like a snug, cushiony hug, yet lightweight, and the EVA midsole added both lightness and flexibility to the shoe. The EVA outsole provided a nice grip on the ground while still being surprisingly soft. 

The Stitchlite knit upper was a game-changer for me, as it hugged my foot like a second skin. I appreciated the classy look it gave, too - a perfect blend of casual and dressy. I was impressed with how this simple shoe managed to make such a statement in my wardrobe. It was as if these shoes were designed to effortlessly level up any outfit. 

However, the fit was just slightly off for me. I found the shoe to be a touch narrow, which caused a bit of discomfort on longer walks. Nonetheless, the overall experience was quite positive. There were no significant drawbacks, and I found the shoe to be quite a steal for its price. 

One thing I would love to see is a wider range of colors for these loafers - the currently available options are quite limited. But overall, I can't wait to slip into these Cole Haan loafers again and see how they elevate my daily style. 


### [Cole Haan Women's Nantucket Black Leather Loafers - Size 8](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Loafers+Women?utm\_term=cole-haan-womens-nantucket-black-leather-loafers-size-8)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Loafers+Women?utm_term=cole-haan-womens-nantucket-black-leather-loafers-size-8"><img alt="cole-haan-womens-nantucket-leather-penny-loafers-black-size-9" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cole-haan-womens-nantucket-leather-penny-loafers-black-size-9/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to slip into a pair of Cole Haan Women's Nantucket Leather Penny Loafers in black, available in size 8 from Saks Fifth Avenue. This sophisticated pair of loafers left quite the impression on me. 

The moment I put them on, the sleek black leather upper and round toe instantly caught my attention. I was impressed with how effortlessly the penny loafers slid onto my feet. This particular Cole Haan design is perfect for a professional look or a casual day out. 

Wearing these Cole Haan Women's Nantucket Leather Penny Loafers felt like stepping into a little piece of heaven. The combination of textile and synthetic lining along with the padded insole made each step comfortable, and the synthetic sole created a natural stride. I couldn't wait to take these shoes on my daily adventures. 

However, there were a couple of small drawbacks, which couldn't overshadow my overall experience. First, the break-in period with this pair may cause some discomfort initially, but it's a common issue with new shoes. I had hoped that the penny slots of these shoes would offer a wider variety of style options, but I found that it limited the number of outfits I could pair them with. 

In conclusion, my experience with the Cole Haan Women's Nantucket Leather Penny Loafers was a mostly positive one. These sophisticated, yet comfortable, shoes added a touch of elegance to my daily wardrobe. While there were a few minor hiccups, the overall experience was certainly worth trying for yourself. 


### [Cole Haan Evelyn Loafer - Sunset Gold Suede for Women](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Loafers+Women?utm\_term=cole-haan-evelyn-loafer-sunset-gold-suede-for-women)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Loafers+Women?utm_term=cole-haan-evelyn-loafer-sunset-gold-suede-for-women"><img alt="cole-haan-evelyn-nubuck-bow-drivers-womens-5-5m-sunset-gold-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cole-haan-evelyn-nubuck-bow-drivers-womens-5-5m-sunset-gold-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried on the Cole Haan Evelyn Nubuck Bow Drivers, a stylish and comfy pair of loafers designed for women. These shoes are an elegant blend of sophistication and practicality, making them a versatile choice for everyday wear. 

The first thing I noticed was the sunset gold suede upper, which added a unique touch to the classic design. The faux fur lining and padded insole ensured that my feet stayed comfortable throughout the day, and the easy slip-on style made them a breeze to put on. Also, the moc toe and man-made outsole added to the shoe's durability and comfort. 

However, I did encounter a minor issue with sizing - having to size up to make the shoes fit my narrow feet. Additionally, I was concerned about the shoe's support after wearing them for a day. 

Overall, the Cole Haan Evelyn Nubuck Bow Drivers were a beautiful addition to my wardrobe, offering both style and comfort. Just be aware that they may not fit true to size and could have some durability concerns over extended wear. 


### [Cole Haan GrandPro Rally Canvas Penny Loafers - Lightweight Women's Sneakers](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Loafers+Women?utm\_term=cole-haan-grandpro-rally-canvas-penny-loafers-lightweight-womens-sneakers)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Loafers+Women?utm_term=cole-haan-grandpro-rally-canvas-penny-loafers-lightweight-womens-sneakers"><img alt="cole-haan-grandpro-rally-womens-canvas-penny-loafers-size-10-5-white-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cole-haan-grandpro-rally-womens-canvas-penny-loafers-size-10-5-white-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried on the Cole Haan Grandpro Rally Canvas loafers, and was pleasantly surprised by the comfort and style of these shoes. The modern craft and traditional penny loafer styling in canvas uppers felt both sleek and classic. Lightweight construction with the injection molded EVA cupsole provided superior support, while the memory foam footbed made every step feel more responsive. The added traction from the textured outsole was a nice touch, too. 

One thing to note, however, is that the size seemed to run a bit large for me. I usually wear a size 8, but with these shoes, I found that they fit more like a 9. Additionally, the canvas material requires a bit more care when cleaning, as it can't be put in the washing machine. 

Overall, I appreciate the all-day comfort and stylish design of the Grandpro Rally Canvas loafers, but do recommend trying on a pair to ensure the right fit. 


### [Cole Haan Deep Burgundy Pinny Loafer - Comfortable Fit for Women](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Loafers+Women?utm\_term=cole-haan-deep-burgundy-pinny-loafer-comfortable-fit-for-women)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Loafers+Women?utm_term=cole-haan-deep-burgundy-pinny-loafer-comfortable-fit-for-women"><img alt="cole-haan-lux-pinch-penny-loafer-in-deep-burgundy-at-nordstrom-size-6" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cole-haan-lux-pinch-penny-loafer-in-deep-burgundy-at-nordstrom-size-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Bringing a touch of elegance to any outfit, these Cole Haan Lux Pinch Penny Loafers boast a classic design. With a gorgeous deep burgundy hue, you'll appreciate the ruched upper detailing that adds a stylish twist to the traditional penny loafer silhouette. The premium leather uppers, along with pinned or ruched detailing, add a luxurious feel. For added craftsmanship, these leather shoes also boast a welt stitch detail. 

The 3D Lux Comfort Technology ensures that you'll walk comfortably, while the full leather soles offer a sturdy base. The buffed synthetic outsole has a weave laser design at the forepart to provide traction. And for those who appreciate sustainable products, Cole Haan leather products are part of the Leather Working Group, which supports responsible manufacturing. 

While the Cole Haan Lux Pinch Penny Loafers may be ideal for those with narrow feet, those with lower insteps might find they require sizing down half a size for a more comfortable fit. In summary, these loafers bring timeless charm and classic craftsmanship to your wardrobe. 


### [Cole Haan Viola Black Suede Loafers for Women](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Loafers+Women?utm\_term=cole-haan-viola-black-suede-loafers-for-women)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Loafers+Women?utm_term=cole-haan-viola-black-suede-loafers-for-women"><img alt="cole-haan-viola-suede-skimmer-7-black-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cole-haan-viola-suede-skimmer-7-black-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a lover of sophisticated flats, the Cole Haan Viola Suede Skimmer quickly caught my eye. I was drawn to the sleek slip-on design and knotted details, making them a perfect addition to my wardrobe. Upon trying them on, I was happy to find that they lived up to their reputation for comfort. 

The fully lined upper made of leather, suede, and haircalf provided the perfect environment for my feet to breathe, while the padded sock lining ensured a snug fit without cutting into my toes. The synthetic outsole, crafted with 32% recycled rubber content, offered both style and sustainability. 

However, there were a few aspects that could be improved. For instance, the suede material tends to attract dirt easily, making it a bit harder to clean than I would have preferred. Additionally, the shoes were not as durable as I had hoped, with signs of wear visible after just a few wears. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, the Cole Haan Viola Suede Skimmer remained a favorite part of my outfit rotation due to its sleek design, comfortable fit, and versatility. While it may not be perfect for everyone, those seeking a stylish and comfortable flat had better give it a try. 


### [Cole Haan Women's Evelyn Bow Driver Loafers](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Loafers+Women?utm\_term=cole-haan-womens-evelyn-bow-driver-loafers)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Loafers+Women?utm_term=cole-haan-womens-evelyn-bow-driver-loafers"><img alt="cole-haan-womens-evelyn-bow-driver-driving-style-loafer-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cole-haan-womens-evelyn-bow-driver-driving-style-loafer-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried on the Cole Haan Evelyn Bow Drivers and I am in love! The suede upper is comfortable and gives the shoes a touch of elegance. The faux fur and shearling linings in half of the shoes are a game-changer for winter days. The fully padded sock lining and rubber pod outsole make it a dream to walk in all day long. 

What I really appreciate about these shoes is the easy slip-on style and the moc toe design. The high-backed heel is supportive and doesn't irritate my skin, which is a struggle I often face with other loafers. 

However, I did notice that the leather is a bit stiff at first, which can be a bit uncomfortable. I would definitely recommend going up half a size for a perfect fit right from the get-go. The 3 pairs of Evelyn loafers in my collection have all been super comfortable and versatile, making them an essential in my wardrobe. Just be mindful of the leather quality, especially in the toe area, as it can wear off after a few wears. 


### [Cole Haan Geneva Chain Loafer: Women's Bloodstone Leather Loafers in Medium](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Loafers+Women?utm\_term=cole-haan-geneva-chain-loafer-womens-bloodstone-leather-loafers-in-medium)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Loafers+Women?utm_term=cole-haan-geneva-chain-loafer-womens-bloodstone-leather-loafers-in-medium"><img alt="cole-haan-geneva-chain-loafer-womens-shoes-bloodstone-leather-5-b-medium-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cole-haan-geneva-chain-loafer-womens-shoes-bloodstone-leather-5-b-medium-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the pleasure of trying on the Cole Haan Geneva Chain Loafer Women's Shoes in Bloodstone Leather. While it was quite stylish and added a touch of elegance to my outfit, there were a few drawbacks to this shoe that I found quite frustrating. 

Firstly, the fit of the shoe was an issue. Although I am usually a size 9, I found that these loafers ran quite long, with my heels constantly slipping off. I even attempted to wear them with thicker socks, but to no avail. The width of the shoe was also quite narrow, making it almost impossible to wear without developing blisters. 

Despite the fit issues, I did appreciate the leather materials used in the making of these shoes. The custom-molded chain detailing on the upper added a unique touch to the classic penny loafer silhouette. Additionally, the fully padded footbed provided rebound with each step, making for a comfortable walking experience. 

Overall, while I enjoyed the classic design and the comfort features of these shoes, the fit issues were too significant to overlook. I would recommend trying on a pair in person to ensure a proper fit before purchasing, and perhaps consider looking for a loafer with a bit more width. 


### [Cole Haan Geneva Loafer for Women - Black Box Calf (Size 11 B - Medium)](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Loafers+Women?utm\_term=cole-haan-geneva-loafer-for-women-black-box-calf-size-11-b-medium)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Loafers+Women?utm_term=cole-haan-geneva-loafer-for-women-black-box-calf-size-11-b-medium"><img alt="cole-haan-geneva-loafer-womens-shoes-black-box-calf-11-b-medium-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cole-haan-geneva-loafer-womens-shoes-black-box-calf-11-b-medium-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Cole Haan Geneva Loafer has been a staple in my wardrobe for months now, and I must say, it's a perfect blend of style and comfort. The chic office looks I've been able to create with its black box calf design are truly a delight. I appreciate the chunky sole and the luxurious suede upper that adds an element of sophistication to my day-to-day life. 

The breathable man-made lining and cushioned insole enhance my comfort, making me feel like I'm walking on clouds even after a long day at work. The lugged synthetic outsole provides durability, which is a plus for someone like me who demands practicality in fashion. However, I must admit that the toe area could be a bit more forgiving. It felt a bit snug around my toes, and a slight stretching might be required for a perfect fit. 

One of the features that stood out the most is the sizing. I was pleasantly surprised it was true to size, despite hearing some customers talk about sizing issues. It's always such a relief to find a shoe that fits well without needing to worry about exchanging or returning. 

Lastly, the price was a little on the higher side, but considering the quality and comfort it offers, I believe it's worth the investment. Overall, I'm quite pleased with the Cole Haan Geneva Loafer and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a stylish yet comfortable loafer.

The Cole Haan Women's Camea Lug Loafer is a stylish and comfortable addition to every wardrobe.

One of the standout features was the responsive cushioning, which offered luxurious all-day comfort. The natural flexibility was also a great plus, allowing for a smooth heel-to-toe movement and reducing fatigue. The multi-layered foam cushioning ensured a well-balanced ride while providing greater support. 

However, there were a few aspects that could have been improved. While the TPU outsole provided enhanced underfoot comfort, the deep rubber flex grooves felt a bit stiff at first, which made it feel a bit less natural. Additionally, the fabric was stretchier than expected, making the fit slightly loose. 

Overall, the Cole Haan 4ZG Stchlt Loafer is a stylish and comfortable option for those who want to look polished while enjoying the benefits of a lightweight, supportive shoe. With some minor adjustments, this shoe could be a real winner. 


### [Cole Haan Women's Brown Leather Loafers - Size 10](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Loafers+Women?utm\_term=cole-haan-womens-brown-leather-loafers-size-10)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Loafers+Women?utm_term=cole-haan-womens-brown-leather-loafers-size-10"><img alt="cole-haan-womens-tully-driver-leather-woven-loafers-womens-size-10-brown-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cole-haan-womens-tully-driver-leather-woven-loafers-womens-size-10-brown-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Recently, I gave the Cole Haan Womens Tully Driver Loafers a try, eager to experience the suede upper and GRANDFAM cushioning they promised. From the get-go, I was impressed with the slip-on style and elegant design, featuring round-toe and metal detailing on the upper. However, I noticed some discrepancies in the construction. 

For starters, I found the leather or suede (it's unclear) to be a little too thin, causing some unwanted wear on the toe. Additionally, the fit seemed slightly off; the toe box felt a bit tight on my toes. It's clear that the sizing isn't consistent, which can be frustrating. 

Despite these drawbacks, I was happy with the comfort level. The GRANDFAM cushioning indeed added an extra level of comfort, making these loafers suitable for long days on my feet. The rubber outsole worked well at providing the traction and stability I needed. 

Overall, the Cole Haan Womens Tully Driver Loafers present a stylish, comfortable option for women. However, be prepared for some minor discomforts (particularly in the toe box and potential inconsistencies in sizing), and perhaps consider an alternative color to avoid similar issues.

One standout feature for me was their exceptional comfort. Despite having a heel, they were incredibly easy to walk in and didn't cause any discomfort throughout the day. However, a downside I've encountered is that they do seem to slip off a bit more than I'd like, so I'd recommend trying a size smaller than usual. 

Overall, the Lux Pinch Penny Loafer Mules are an attractive choice for anyone looking for stylish yet comfortable footwear. 


### [Luxury Cole Haan Women's Blue Denim Penny Loafer at Nordstrom - Size 9.5](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Loafers+Women?utm\_term=luxury-cole-haan-womens-blue-denim-penny-loafer-at-nordstrom-size-9-5)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Loafers+Women?utm_term=luxury-cole-haan-womens-blue-denim-penny-loafer-at-nordstrom-size-9-5"><img alt="cole-haan-lux-pinch-penny-loafer-in-blue-denim-at-nordstrom-size-9-6" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cole-haan-lux-pinch-penny-loafer-in-blue-denim-at-nordstrom-size-9-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Oh, these Cole Haan Lux Pinch Penny Loafers were a treat to try on! I've been living in blue denim lately, so this option was perfect for me. When I first put them on, I couldn't help but notice the stitched seam detail on the heel - such a classic touch, isn't it? The 3D Lux Comfort Technology really does make a difference, I felt like I was walking on clouds without any uncomfortable pressure on my feet. They sure know how to make a comfortable shoe! 

However, there was one drawback that I noticed. Since my feet are quite regular in size, I found them to be a bit tight around the strap. Maybe this could've been improved if there's a stretch component added. I guess it is one size fits all, but we can always hope for a more universal fit! 

Overall, I'm pretty happy with my choice of these stylish blue denim loafers. They've been great for my casual errands and look fantastic with my favorite jeans. And while they may not be the softest shoes I've ever tried, they certainly make up for it with their fashionable appearance and all-day comfort. What do you think?
