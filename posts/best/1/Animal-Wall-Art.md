### [Smarten Arts Resin Deer Wall Art with Gold Antlers](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Animal+Wall+Art?utm\_term=smarten-arts-resin-deer-wall-art-with-gold-antlers)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Animal+Wall+Art?utm_term=smarten-arts-resin-deer-wall-art-with-gold-antlers"><img alt="smarten-arts-animal-head-art-wall-decor-flocking-resin-deer-with-gold-antlers-for-wall-mount-decorat-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/smarten-arts-animal-head-art-wall-decor-flocking-resin-deer-with-gold-antlers-for-wall-mount-decorat-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Imagine having a wall decoration that not only looks stunning, but also carries a story of its own. That's exactly what Smarten Arts' Animal Head Art Wall Decor Flocking Resin Deer with Gold Antlers does. I recently added this beautiful piece to my living space, and it has quickly become the center of attention. 

What truly stood out for me was the use of faux fur, felt, and velvet to create a lifelike look for the deer, making it appear more realistic than you'd expect. The Antlers, with their option of silver, gold, and white colors, add a touch of elegance and versatility. Plus, the keyhole on the back makes it super convenient for simple hanging. 

However, one thing to note is the weight of the piece, which is relatively light. I would recommend gluing the antlers securely to the deer head before hanging, especially if it's in a high traffic area or above a bed or baby crib. 

All in all, this stunning deer head with antlers has become a great conversation starter in my home, and I'm thrilled to be able to support an animal-friendly option in my decor.
