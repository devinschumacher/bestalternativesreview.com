### [Westerly Solar Powered Driveway Markers: No Wires Outdoor Lighting](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Driveway+Lights?utm\_term=westerly-solar-powered-driveway-markers-no-wires-outdoor-lighting)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Driveway+Lights?utm_term=westerly-solar-powered-driveway-markers-no-wires-outdoor-lighting"><img alt="westerly-6-pack-3-5ft-42-inch-solar-powered-driveway-markers-driveway-lights-landscape-path-lights-s-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/westerly-6-pack-3-5ft-42-inch-solar-powered-driveway-markers-driveway-lights-landscape-path-lights-s-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

An exceptional aspect is that there is no need for messy wiring, as you can easily install them without encountering any complications, perfect for driveways, garden paths, or any outdoor space. 

The icing on the cake is that the markers offer two illumination modes - a consistent light and a flashing one. The light source features a charging duration of 6-8 hours, depending on full sunlight, while providing a consistent glow for the same duration. Alternatively, the flashing light mode offers an illumination that endures between 12 to 14 hours. However, there is a minor pitfall. The solar-powered technology is sensitive to shadows, and it might turn off the lights on overcast days or when other objects obstruct sunlight. Overall, the Westerly 6-pack is a well-designed, efficient choice for outdoor lighting.

If you're in search of a reliable solar-powered driveway marker that boasts easy installation and functional illumination, the Westerly 6-pack is a competitive option. Although it might face occasional lighting issues due to shadow sensitivity, it remains a top choice for outdoor enthusiasts.
