### [Richelieu Luxury Crystal Drawer Knobs](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Crystal+Drawer+Knobs?utm\_term=richelieu-luxury-crystal-drawer-knobs)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Crystal+Drawer+Knobs?utm_term=richelieu-luxury-crystal-drawer-knobs"><img alt="richelieu-1-1-4-inch-crystal-knob-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/richelieu-1-1-4-inch-crystal-knob-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Incorporating these elegant Richelieu Crystal Drawer Knobs into my daily life has been a delightful experience. Their classic octagonal design brings a touch of luxury to any room, be it the kitchen or bathroom. The slightly raised crystal surface enhances the elegant sophistication of these knobs, and once in place, they exude an air of polished charm. 

The side projection isn't too excessive, but just enough to draw the eye without overwhelming, while the front-to-back knob width stays practical and within reasonable limits. My only gripe would be the depth of the knob for screws, which is quite shallow, thus requiring the use of additional, compatible screws. Other than that inconvenience, I have been thoroughly pleased with my purchase and the overall elegance it has added to my space.

The only downside I encountered was the product's warning under Proposition 65, stating that it may expose users to a chemical classified by the State of California as a known carcinogen. However, I also found that such warnings are common in a variety of products and not always applicable to the user. 

Overall, these Mtsooning Crystal Glass Knobs are an excellent choice for anyone looking to add a touch of elegance to their home. Their versatile screw lengths, sleek design, and easy installation process make them a solid pick for any project.
