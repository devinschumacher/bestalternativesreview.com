Despite their compact size, the speakers deliver a surprisingly powerful sound, making them a great choice for both music and video playback. The vibrant bass provided by these speakers really added to my overall listening experience. 

However, I did find that the blue LED lighting can be a bit jarring, especially when used in a dimly lit room. It would be great if there was an option to turn it off or make it dimmer. 

Overall, I'm quite satisfied with the Amazon Basics USB-Powered Silver Speakers. They're well-built, compact, and sound great for the price. While there might be better quality speakers on the market, these are a perfect fit for those looking for a cost-effective solution.

### [Bose Companion 2: High-Quality Computer Multimedia Speakers](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Computer+Speakers?utm\_term=bose-companion-2-high-quality-computer-multimedia-speakers)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Computer+Speakers?utm_term=bose-companion-2-high-quality-computer-multimedia-speakers"><img alt="bose-companion-2-multimedia-speaker-system-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bose-companion-2-multimedia-speaker-system-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When Bose first released their Companion 2 Series II multimedia speaker system, I was hesitant to buy a new pair of speakers for my computer. After all, most computer speakers just don't deliver the kind of sound I was looking for. But boy, was I surprised when I finally tried these out! The first thing I noticed was just how sleek and compact these speakers were. They easily fit into my cramped workspace, without taking up too much valuable desk space. I wasn't expecting much sound-wise from such small speakers, but I was wrong. The Companion 2s delivered a sharp, expansive sound that completely blew me away. From the rich bass in movies to the clear and crisp high notes in songs, these speakers truly allowed me to unleash the full potential of my computer's sound quality. 

One feature I absolutely loved was that they allowed me to connect my computer and portable audio sources at the same time, thanks to their convenient dual inputs. Plus, the volume and headphone jack were perfectly positioned on the front of one speaker, making it a breeze to adjust the sound to my liking. Another thing I appreciated was the magnetically shielded speakers. These ensured that my monitor was not affected by any interference from the speakers, which is a common issue for many other computer speaker systems. 

However, there were a few downsides to using these Companion 2s. Firstly, they didn't include a subwoofer in the package, which was a bit disappointing, especially considering the high-quality sound they produced. Additionally, I found that the speakers had to be placed quite close to each other in order to achieve the best sound quality, otherwise the audio would sound weak and muffled. 

Overall, despite the few cons, I am really happy with my decision to purchase these Bose Companion 2 speakers. The pros far outweigh any negatives, and I highly recommend them for anyone looking for a high-quality computer speaker system that won't compromise on sound quality or style. 


### [Bose Companion 20 Computer Speakers - Full, Natural Sound for PC](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Computer+Speakers?utm\_term=bose-companion-20-computer-speakers-full-natural-sound-for-pc)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Computer+Speakers?utm_term=bose-companion-20-computer-speakers-full-natural-sound-for-pc"><img alt="bose-companion-20-speakers-for-pc-silver-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bose-companion-20-speakers-for-pc-silver-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Recently, I stumbled upon the Bose Companion 20 speakers and was excited to give them a try. As someone who spends a lot of time on their computer, I knew that having a high-quality sound system would greatly enhance my overall experience. 

First and foremost, the sound quality of these speakers is top-notch. The TrueSpace technology ensures that the sound is natural and wide, making it perfect for listening to music, playing games, or watching videos. The sound is rich and clear, with impressive low notes that really bring the audio to life. And the fact that everything comes from just two speakers is quite impressive! 

Another standout feature of these speakers is the sleek, space-saving design. They look great on my desk and don't take up much space, which is always a plus. The silver finish complements my computer perfectly and adds a touch of elegance to the setup. 

However, there are a couple of areas where the Bose Companion 20 speakers fell short in my experience. For one, the control pod could be more user-friendly. While the rotational volume control and one-touch mute functionality are convenient, finding the right inputs for connecting headphones or a second audio source can be a bit challenging. 

Additionally, the lack of an equalizer is a bit disappointing for those who want more control over the sound. As someone who values a bit of bass in their music, I found that the sound was a bit too flat without the option to adjust it manually. 

Overall, the Bose Companion 20 speakers are a solid choice for anyone looking for a high-quality sound system for their computer. The natural, wide sound, and space-saving design make them a great addition to any setup. Just keep in mind that the lack of an equalizer and the potentially confusing control pod may be deal-breakers for some users.

### Connectivity Options

Computer speakers can be connected to your computer using various methods, such as USB, Bluetooth, or analog RCA inputs.

### What are some features to look for when purchasing computer speakers?

When shopping for computer speakers, there are several features to consider. First, check the number of channels that the speakers support. Stereo (2-channel) speakers offer a wider soundstage and better separation of audio sources, while surround sound (5.1 or 7.1 channel) speakers create a more immersive experience. Next, consider the power of the speakers in watts, as this affects the sound quality and volume. You may also want to look for additional features such as built-in subwoofers for deeper bass, adjustable equalizer settings, or Bluetooth connectivity for wireless streaming.

### What is the difference between USB and Bluetooth connectivity for computer speakers?

Both USB and Bluetooth connectivity options are commonly used for computer speakers, but they offer different advantages and limitations. USB connectivity is a straightforward and reliable option that requires no additional setup, as the speakers connect directly to the computer via a USB cable. This makes it an ideal choice for users who prefer a simple, plug-and-play setup. Additionally, USB connections often provide a more stable and consistent audio signal, which can result in better sound quality and fewer disruptions. 

On the other hand, Bluetooth connectivity offers more flexibility and convenience, as it allows you to connect your computer speakers to other Bluetooth-enabled devices such as smartphones, tablets, or gaming consoles. This makes it an attractive option for users who want to enjoy their music or movies on different devices without having to switch cables. However, Bluetooth connections can be subject to signal interference and latency issues, which may affect the audio quality and sync between the speakers and your devices. 


### Can I connect my computer speakers to my smartphone or tablet?

Yes, you can connect your computer speakers to your smartphone or tablet using Bluetooth connectivity. This makes it easy to switch between devices and enjoy your music or movies on different platforms without having to switch cables or connectors. In order to do this, you'll need to enable Bluetooth on both your computer and your smartphone or tablet, and then pair the two devices by searching for available Bluetooth devices on the computer and selecting the desired speakers from the list. 

If your computer speakers and your smartphone or tablet both support Bluetooth, you can also use them independently or in conjunction with other audio sources. This makes it easy to enjoy music or movies from your smartphone while using your computer for work or other tasks. Just make sure to manage the volume levels and audio sources on both devices to avoid any overlapping or inconsistent audio.
