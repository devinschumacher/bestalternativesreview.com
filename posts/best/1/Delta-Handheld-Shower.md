The detachable hand shower feature was a game changer, allowing me to wash my body easily and reach hard-to-reach areas without any struggle.

However, I did notice some slight leakage from one of the shower heads, but overall, the product has exceeded my expectations. The handheld shower and additional spray options provide a whole new level of flexibility, making my shower experience more enjoyable and hassle-free.

### [Delta Universal Dual Shower Handheld and Grab Bar Hand Shower Kit](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Delta+Handheld+Shower?utm\_term=delta-universal-dual-shower-handheld-and-grab-bar-hand-shower-kit)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Delta+Handheld+Shower?utm_term=delta-universal-dual-shower-handheld-and-grab-bar-hand-shower-kit"><img alt="delta-t13h383-25-universal-dual-shower-trim-diverter-hand-shower-and-grab-bar-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/delta-t13h383-25-universal-dual-shower-trim-diverter-hand-shower-and-grab-bar-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try out Delta's T13H383-25 Universal Dual Shower Trim Diverter Hand Shower and Grab Bar, and I have to say, it was quite the experience. The hand shower itself was a real game-changer, with a flow rate of 1.13 gallons per minute at 45 PSI. The lever blade handle made it easy to adjust the water flow, and its ADA compliance of 57 mm (2.24 inches) was a plus for accessibility. 

One of the standout features was the H2Okinetic Technology Showerhead, which improved water flow and made each shower feel luxurious. The arm and flange were also solid, ensuring a secure attachment to the wall. However, the installation process could have been smoother, as it required a bit of fiddling with the rough-in valve series. 

Overall, the Delta Handheld Shower was a reliable and innovative addition to my daily shower routine. Its combination of style, functionality, and smart design made it a welcome addition to my bathroom. 


### [Delta In2ition 1.75gpm Recertified Shower with Hand Shower and Pause Setting](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Delta+Handheld+Shower?utm\_term=delta-in2ition-1-75gpm-recertified-shower-with-hand-shower-and-pause-setting)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Delta+Handheld+Shower?utm_term=delta-in2ition-1-75gpm-recertified-shower-with-hand-shower-and-pause-setting"><img alt="delta-universal-showering-in2ition-1-75gpm-hssh-4-setting-recertified-chrome-75494-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/delta-universal-showering-in2ition-1-75gpm-hssh-4-setting-recertified-chrome-75494-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Delta Universal Showering In2ition has completely changed my showering game. Its 4-setting design lets me switch between the shower head and hand shower depending on the situation - all while using the same unit. It's convenient, yet functional. The detachable shower head has a pause setting, which is perfect for applying shaving cream or doing other tasks in the shower without fear of wasting water. 

One of the highlights is the soft rubber Touch-Clean spray holes. They make water cleaning quite easy, without the need for soaking or any harsh chemicals. My shower head doesn't look unsightly and boring anymore! 

However, I must admit there's one drawback. The water flow rate, although efficient, is a bit lower than what I'm used to, which can make showering feel a little less relaxing at times. But it's a small price to pay considering the water conservation it offers. This showerhead truly reflects the philosophy of water-saving technology and environmental conservation. I consider it an investment worth making. 


### [Delta In2ition Handheld Shower](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Delta+Handheld+Shower?utm\_term=delta-in2ition-handheld-shower)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Delta+Handheld+Shower?utm_term=delta-in2ition-handheld-shower"><img alt="delta-faucet-75588-in2ition-hand-shower-showerhead-combo-chrome-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/delta-faucet-75588-in2ition-hand-shower-showerhead-combo-chrome-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Delta In2ition Shower made a splash in my daily routine. I'd been using a basic showerhead with minimal customization options, so I was excited to try out this fancy combo package. One of the first things I noticed was the sleek design and versatility of the handheld shower. It was a cinch to set up as well - just snap the hand shower onto or off the main showerhead and I was good to go. 

But after using it for a couple of weeks, a few issues started to emerge. Firstly, I found the water pressure to be quite low, which was a bummer. While the hand shower made bathroom tasks like rinsing shampoo from my hair easier, the reduced pressure left me longing for my old showerhead's punch. Secondly, I encountered some durability concerns. After just a few weeks of usage, the hand shower's hose started to show signs of wear, worrying me about its long-term durability. 

Don't get me wrong - the features of the Delta In2ition Shower were innovative and a welcomed change from my previous showerhead. But the low water pressure and early signs of hose wear were definite drawbacks. Overall, it's a handy tool to have in a pinch, but it didn't seem to be built for the long haul. 


### [Delta Modern Raincan Round Shower System with Handheld Spray](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Delta+Handheld+Shower?utm\_term=delta-modern-raincan-round-shower-system-with-handheld-spray)

This stylish modern shower system from Delta combines a sleek design with convenient features that make every shower an enjoyable experience. The 10-inch round raincan shower head with a single spray setting delivers a gentle, rain-like experience, while the wall mount hand shower with a single spray setting provides added flexibility for rinsing off. 

The system also includes a MultiChoice Universal Integrated Shower Diverter Valve rough (R22000 series), allowing you to switch between the rain showerhead and the handheld spray effortlessly. Users will also appreciate the 2-function diverter that offers two individual positions: shower head only or hand shower only. 

With its easy-to-clean soft rubber Touch-Clean spray holes and WaterSense certified efficiency, this Delta handheld shower truly stands out among the competition.

I recently added the Delta In2ition Two-in-One Shower to my home, and I must say, it's been a game-changer in my daily routine. This showerhead has a detachable hand shower that can be used separately or combined with the main showerhead, giving me the ultimate flexibility in my shower experience. 

One feature that stood out to me is the powerful integrated magnet that keeps the faucet spray wand or In2ition hand shower in place when not in use. It's quite handy, as I no longer have to worry about the wand slipping out of its docking station. 

Another aspect I appreciate is the soft rubber Touch-Clean spray holes, which eliminate the need to soak or use harsh chemicals for cleaning. I've noticed that mineral build-up has become a thing of the past with this showerhead. 

The pause setting on this shower is another great feature, allowing me to conserve water while shaving or performing other shower tasks. It's not only eco-friendly but also helps me save on my water bill. 

The Delta In2ition Two-in-One Shower's WaterSense label makes it clear that it uses at least 20% less water than the industry standard, allowing me to save water without compromising performance. Overall, this showerhead has exceeded my expectations and has made my daily shower routine more enjoyable and efficient.

The Delta Universal Showering Hand Shower is a versatile and stylish addition to any bathroom. With a stainless steel finish and seven settings to choose from, you'll be able to customize your shower experience to suit your preferences. The hand shower even features a recertified 75601SN designation, ensuring you're getting a high-quality product at a great value. 

One of the key benefits of this hand shower is its soft rubber Touch-Clean spray holes. These innovative holes allow for easy removal of mineral build-up, eliminating the need for soaking or the use of harsh chemicals. Plus, the pause setting is perfect for multitasking during your shower routine. 

But it's not just about functionality; the Delta Universal Showering Hand Shower also helps you conserve water. WaterSense labeled products use up to 20% less water than the industry standard, making this hand shower not just a smart choice for you, but also a responsible one for the environment.

As a fan of minimalist design, I was drawn to the sleek and stylish Delta Nicoli Monitor 14 Series bath and shower system. The matte black finish perfectly complements any modern bath, and theSureDock hand shower offers an adjustable spray pattern with six different modes to personalize my shower experience. 

The pause feature is a game-changer - it allows me to effortlessly lather up without worrying about a temperature drop. The water flow is smooth and steady, ensuring a comfortable shower even with the pause setting. The MultiChoice Universal Valve, trim, and 1.75 gallons per minute flow rate make this shower system a top-notch choice for my bathroom. 

However, the instructions for installation could have been more user-friendly, and I had to search online for additional information to properly connect the system. Overall, the Delta Nicoli Monitor 14 Series tub and shower proves to be a great addition to my bathroom, providing an enjoyable and efficient showering experience. 


### [Delta 4-Spray Dual Wall Mount Shower Head with Handheld Option in SpotShield Brushed Nickel](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Delta+Handheld+Shower?utm\_term=delta-4-spray-dual-wall-mount-shower-head-with-handheld-option-in-spotshield-brushed-nickel)

### [Delta Modern Raincan Square Shower System - SpotShield Brushed Nickel](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Delta+Handheld+Shower?utm\_term=delta-modern-raincan-square-shower-system-spotshield-brushed-nickel)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Delta+Handheld+Shower?utm_term=delta-modern-raincan-square-shower-system-spotshield-brushed-nickel"><img alt="delta-342701-sp-modern-raincan-square-shower-system-rain-shower-head-with-handheld-spray-shower-fauc-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/delta-342701-sp-modern-raincan-square-shower-system-rain-shower-head-with-handheld-spray-shower-fauc-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

With its brushed nickel finish, the system seamlessly blends into any bathroom setting, while the large square shower head adds a touch of luxury to my daily morning routine. 

One of the most impressive features of this shower system is its ability to maintain water pressure even when running multiple appliances simultaneously. This is particularly useful for those who have family members that require assistance while showering, ensuring they can enjoy a safe and comfortable experience. 

Additionally, the soft rubber Touch-Clean spray holes ensure easy maintenance, as mineral buildup can be easily wiped away without the need for soaking or harsh chemicals. This detail-oriented design not only enhances the shower's aesthetic but also makes it incredibly user-friendly.

Furthermore, the handheld showerhead offers the flexibility to reach every inch of the body, making the Delta 342701-SP a thoughtfully designed and practical product. 

However, one potential drawback for some users may be the lack of a drain included with the system. Nonetheless, the benefits of this modern shower system greatly outweigh this minor issue, making the Delta 342701-SP a worthwhile investment for any home. 


### [Delta Universal Dual Shower Handheld & Grab Bar](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Delta+Handheld+Shower?utm\_term=delta-universal-dual-shower-handheld-grab-bar)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Delta+Handheld+Shower?utm_term=delta-universal-dual-shower-handheld-grab-bar"><img alt="delta-t13h303-20-universal-dual-shower-trim-diverter-hand-shower-and-grab-bar-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/delta-t13h303-20-universal-dual-shower-trim-diverter-hand-shower-and-grab-bar-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Delta's T13H303-20 Universal Dual Shower Trim Diverter Hand Shower and Grab Bar might seem like a mouthful, but it's a fantastic product that has become an integral part of my daily routine. I love the fact that it's a dual shower, meaning I can easily switch between the two depending on my needs. 

One of the features that stood out to me, particularly during my morning rush hours, is the water efficiency. It has a flow rate of 1.5 GPM. The round shape of the showerhead also helps in effective water distribution. The lever handle is intuitive and easy to operate, even when using it with wet hands. 

However, I must admit there's one downside - it feels a bit heavy, especially when the grab bar is being used. This could be a problem for someone using it in the bathtub, but it's quite manageable in my shower stall. 

Despite this minor inconvenience, overall, the T13H303-20 has been a reliable and user-friendly addition to my bathroom.

I recently got my hands on this modern shower system from Delta and let me tell you, it's a game-changer in my bathroom experience. The sleek design is just the icing on the cake, but the functionality is what sets it apart. The MultiChoice Universal Shower Diverter Valve rough (R22000 series) has made it incredibly easy to switch between the showerhead and the hand shower, allowing for customized showering routines. 

One of my favorite features is the ability to control the diverter functions with the top handle and the on/off and temperature with the bottom handle. It's a small detail, but it provides a level of convenience that I hadn't considered before. The back-to-back installation capability also saved me a ton of time and effort when setting it up, which was a delightful surprise. 

However, there was one downside — the water pressure. For someone who enjoys a powerful shower, it was a bit underwhelming. But, I found that a simple adjustment to the flow rate solved the issue, and now it's perfect. 

Overall, I'm extremely pleased with this Delta shower system. It's an attractive addition to my bathroom, boasts a quality build, and provides a reliable shower experience. If you're looking for a modern and functional shower system, look no further. 


### [Delta Stainless Dual Shower Head 2.5-GPM](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Delta+Handheld+Shower?utm\_term=delta-stainless-dual-shower-head-2-5-gpm)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Delta+Handheld+Shower?utm_term=delta-stainless-dual-shower-head-2-5-gpm"><img alt="delta-universal-showering-components-stainless-dual-shower-head-2-5-gpm-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/delta-universal-showering-components-stainless-dual-shower-head-2-5-gpm-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Delta In2ition Two-in-One Shower, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer for me. Not only does it have that stylish, sleek, and modern design that fits perfectly in my bathroom, but it also comes with a powerful MagnaTite docking ability. It magnetically helps me keep the wand, so it doesn't end up in a tangled mess, making my bathroom space not only look more organized but also very user-friendly. 

I've used this shower on different occasions, and the H2Okinetic Shower technology has really stood out to me. The unique water pattern creates a drench spray that feels like a luxurious shower every time I use it. Plus, it doesn't make me worry about using more water than necessary, since it achieves a similar sensation without wasting any. It's a great feature for being environmentally conscious, which is something I appreciate. 

The pause setting is also a real lifesaver. I've used it while shaving and doing other tasks inside the shower, conserving water without feeling like I'm missing out on my shower experience. The flexibility offered by this shower is something I've never experienced before, and I'm really glad I went with it. 

However, there are a couple of things I've noticed that could potentially be improved. One is the hose length; it could be longer to make it even more convenient for use outside the shower. Additionally, I've found that the water flow rate may not be the highest for some users, depending on their preferences and local water pressure. But overall, I'm really satisfied with this product, and I highly recommend it to anyone in the market for a shower upgrade.

I've been using the Delta Universal Showerhead and Hand Held Combo for quite some time now, and it's been quite an experience. The 10-inch Raincan showerhead has a square shape, providing a wide coverage area for a refreshing shower. The handheld shower is perfect for pets or for those times when you want to lather up without having to step out of the shower. One of the unique features I appreciated was the 3-way diverter, allowing the user to use the showerhead and the handheld separately or together. 

What I loved most about this combo was the easy-to-install wall mounting bracket. It eliminated the need for going behind the wall, making it a breeze to set up. Moreover, the soft rubber Touch-Clean spray holes made it simple to clean mineral buildup without any hassle. The WaterSense labeling ensured that the shower used 20% less water without compromising performance, which was an added bonus. 

However, there was one minor drawback I noticed. The product lacked an option to adjust the water pressure, which would have enhanced the overall experience. Nonetheless, this was a small issue that didn't significantly impact my satisfaction with the Delta Universal Shower Combo. Overall, I highly recommend this product for anyone seeking a functional, easy-to-use, and stylish shower system.
