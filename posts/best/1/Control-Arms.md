Imagine enhancing your car's performance with Tuningsworld's Control Arms Front Tubular Upper/Lower. Made especially for Chevrolet, Buick, and other GM A Body models from 1964 to 1972, these control arms provide superior steering and handling. 

These control arms feature a conventional lower coil spring pocket with stamped steel and shock locating features, along with outserts for the attachment. By improving the suspension geometry, these upgraded arms increase camber gain and help with roll camber. They have been redesigned to provide better performance for any car enthusiast. 

Another highlight of these control arms are the greaseable bushings on the upper arms, which offer increased stiffness over the stock, leading to more consistent and precise handling. The poly bushings are more durable than regular rubber material, making your car more responsive for daily and high-speed drives. 

However, these control arms may require some modifications, so they are most suitable for disc brake applications. Also, the package does not come with an instruction manual, and professional installation is recommended. 

In summary, Tuningsworld's Control Arms Front Tubular Upper/Lower make for excellent upgrades for your car's performance, especially if you're into hot rods or race car enthusiast. They are available in a black finish, and it's recommended for users in the specified areas to contact customer service before placing an order. 


### [Rough Country Upgraded Forged Upper Control Arms for Chevy/GMC 1500 (07-18)](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Control+Arms?utm\_term=rough-country-upgraded-forged-upper-control-arms-for-chevy-gmc-1500-07-18)

Rough Country's Forged Upper Control Arms are an excellent upgrade for your Chevy or GMC 1500. I was surprised by the attention to detail in the OE upgrade, and the improvements in both stability and durability were evident. 

The POM ball joints were a noteworthy feature for me. They provided a more significant range of motion, making installation a breeze and correcting the ball joint angle for lifted applications. The fully greaseable design reduced metal-to-metal contact, resulting in less maintenance and a longer service life. 

The lightweight construction was impressive, as the forged aluminum control arms combined strength with durability. The elimination of welding weak spots is a well-thought-out design, providing optimal performance and longevity. The rubber bushings were another great aspect, improving the control arms' reliability and performance. 

Overall, these Forged Upper Control Arms delivered when it comes to stability, durability, and ease of installation.

### [Johnny Joint Adjustable Control Arms for Jeep JK Wrangler](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Control+Arms?utm\_term=johnny-joint-adjustable-control-arms-for-jeep-jk-wrangler)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Control+Arms?utm_term=johnny-joint-adjustable-control-arms-for-jeep-jk-wrangler"><img alt="currie-ce-9807ca-johnny-joint-control-arms-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/currie-ce-9807ca-johnny-joint-control-arms-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Southern Truck SCA02 0-Inch - 1-Inch Short Control Arms](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Control+Arms?utm\_term=southern-truck-sca02-0-inch-1-inch-short-control-arms)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Control+Arms?utm_term=southern-truck-sca02-0-inch-1-inch-short-control-arms"><img alt="southern-truck-sca02-0-inch-1-inch-stock-short-control-arms-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/southern-truck-sca02-0-inch-1-inch-stock-short-control-arms-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

## Buyer's Guide

Control arms are an essential component in any vehicle suspension system, providing stability and control while maneuvering the car. This buyer's guide will help you understand the critical features, considerations, and advice when selecting control arms for your vehicle. 


### Materials

Control arms are typically made from either steel or aluminum, both offering their advantages. Steel control arms are known for their strength and durability but can also be heavy and less desirable for weight-conscious buyers. Aluminum control arms are lighter and can help reduce unsprung mass, providing better handling and performance. However, they may be less durable and can be more prone to flex under heavy loads and impact. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Control+Arms"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Control-Arms-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Control-Arms-2" height="540"></a></div>


### Bushing Materials

Another important consideration when choosing control arms is the bushing material. Control arm bushings are the connectors between the arm and other suspension components, absorbing shock and dampening vibrations. Common bushing materials include rubber, polyurethane, and steel. Rubber bushings are generally inexpensive and flexible but may wear out quickly and affect handling. Polyurethane bushings are stiffer and provide better support and handling but may contribute to a stiffer ride. Steel bushings offer the longest life span, minimal deflection, and a more comfortable ride quality but can be quite expensive and require maintenance for lubrication. 


### Design

Control arms come in different designs to cater to various applications and suspension systems. Some common designs include double wishbone, multi-link, and MacPherson strut control arms. Double wishbone arms are widely used in high-performance vehicles for improved handling and stability. Multi-link control arms are versatile and allow for better control over body motion and ride quality. MacPherson strut control arms consist of a coilover system, offering a balance of handling and comfort. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Control+Arms"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Control-Arms-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Control-Arms-3" height="540"></a></div>


### Manufacturing Standards

It's crucial to consider the manufacturing standards and quality control processes when purchasing control arms. Reputable brands often adhere to industry-standard quality control measures, ensuring precision, accuracy, and durability. A proper fitment and alignment process is also vital for optimal performance and longevity of the control arms. 


## FAQ

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Control+Arms"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Control-Arms-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Control-Arms-4" height="540"></a></div>


### What are Control Arms?

Control arms, also known as control arms suspension kits or control arm bushings, are mechanical components designed to improve the overall handling and stability of a vehicle. This improvement can be attributed to better control of the vehicle's suspension system, which plays a crucial role in absorbing shocks and maintaining contact with the road surface. 

Control arms come in various shapes and sizes, and they are typically made of materials such as aluminum or steel. They can be found in different levels of quality, from budget options to high-end performance parts. In general, upgrading to a better control arm suspension kit can lead to enhanced driving experience, increased longevity of other suspension components, and improved safety. 


### Why would I need to replace my control arms?

Over time, control arms can wear out or become damaged due to regular use and exposure to various weather conditions. This wear can lead to reduced performance in terms of handling, stability, and comfort. Additionally, worn-out control arms may cause the vehicle to produce strange noises or vibrations, which can be annoying to the driver and passengers. By replacing the control arms, you can restore the vehicle's performance and improve the overall driving experience. 

In some cases, damaged control arms can also result in reduced safety for the vehicle and its occupants. For instance, if a control arm fails or becomes loose, it may cause the vehicle to lose traction or veer off course, putting the driver and passengers at risk. Therefore, it is essential to replace worn-out or damaged control arms to ensure the vehicle remains safe and reliable. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Control+Arms"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Control-Arms-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Control-Arms-5" height="540"></a></div>


### How do I know if my control arms need replacement?

There are several signs that indicate it is time to replace your control arms. One of the most common symptoms is a change in the vehicle's handling characteristics, such as poor steering, excessive body roll, or inconsistent tire wear. If you notice any of these issues, it might be a sign that your control arms are worn out. 

Another clue is the presence of unusual noises or vibrations when accelerating, braking, or turning the steering wheel. These sounds can be caused by damaged or worn-out control arms, which need to be inspected and potentially replaced. Lastly, if you observe visible damage, such as cracks, rust, or signs of wear, on the control arms, it is a clear indication that they need to be replaced. 


### What are the benefits of upgrading control arms?

There are several benefits to upgrading your control arms. First and foremost, they can greatly improve the vehicle's performance and handling. Upgraded control arms often provide better stability, better road contact, and more precise steering, which in turn leads to a more enjoyable driving experience and increased confidence on the road. 

In addition to improved performance, upgrading control arms can also extend the lifespan of other suspension components. As control arms wear out, they can cause other components, such as coil springs, struts, and bushings, to wear out prematurely. By replacing the control arms, you can help prevent this premature wear and reduce the overall cost of maintaining the vehicle's suspension system. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Control+Arms"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Control-Arms-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Control-Arms-6" height="540"></a></div>


### What is the difference between OE and aftermarket control arms?

OE (Original Equipment) control arms are the parts that come directly from the vehicle manufacturer and are designed to fit your specific make and model. These control arms are typically built to meet the vehicle's manufacturer specifications and will perform as expected when installed. However, they can be costly and may not always be the most durable or high-performance option available. 

Aftermarket control arms, on the other hand, are manufactured by third-party companies to offer an alternative to OE parts. These control arms are often designed to be more durable, offer better performance, and cost less than OE alternatives. However, it is essential to ensure that the aftermarket control arm you choose is compatible with your vehicle and meets your performance requirements before making a purchase. 


### How do I choose the right control arm for my vehicle?

To choose the right control arm for your vehicle, consider the following factors: compatibility, performance level, and budget. Start by identifying the make and model of your vehicle, as well as the specific year and trim level. This information will help you find control arms that are designed to fit your vehicle and meet the required performance standards. 

Next, determine your performance expectations. If you are looking for a simple replacement or want to improve the vehicle's handling and safety, a standard aftermarket control arm may be sufficient. However, if you are looking to maximize performance on a track or in a high-performance driving environment, consider upgrading to a high-performance or race-spec control arm. Finally, consider your budget, as there is a wide range of control arm prices available, and it is essential to find a high-quality option that fits your financial constraints.
