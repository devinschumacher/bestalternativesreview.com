### [4.5ct White Gold London Blue Topaz Stud Earrings](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Blue+Topaz+Earrings?utm\_term=4-5ct-white-gold-london-blue-topaz-stud-earrings)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Blue+Topaz+Earrings?utm_term=4-5ct-white-gold-london-blue-topaz-stud-earrings"><img alt="macys-14k-white-gold-earrings-london-blue-topaz-stud-earrings-4-1-2-ct-t-w-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/macys-14k-white-gold-earrings-london-blue-topaz-stud-earrings-4-1-2-ct-t-w-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Lately, I've been on the lookout for some cool accessories to spice up my everyday look, and these London Blue Topaz Stud Earrings by Macy's fit the bill perfectly! Their shade of blue is so deep and rich, it's like a splash of cool water against a warm summer day. One thing that stood out to me was how comfortable these earrings are to wear. No scratchy, uncomfortable metal for me! Instead, they're crafted in 14k white gold, which is both a stylish and hypoallergenic choice. 

However, during my experience, there were a few aspects that could have been better. I noticed that the post backs of these earrings are made of plastic, not gold, which isn't exactly what I expected for a pair of gemstone earrings. It might not seem like a big deal, but for the price I paid, I had hoped for a more premium feel. 

Now, let's talk about the packaging. It seems like it could use some work too. When I received the earrings, they came in a simple, plastic bag with no box or any kind of presentation. It would have been much nicer if Macy's had taken the time to put these beauties in a nice gift box or something special. 

Despite these minor issues, I'm still quite happy with my purchase. The earrings are stunning and really stand out, which I appreciate. They're definitely a conversation starter and I've been getting lots of compliments on them. 

Overall, the London Blue Topaz Stud Earrings by Macy's are a cool, stylish addition to any outfit. They're comfortable, unique, and sure to turn heads. Just be sure to check the quality of the post backs before you buy, and maybe consider asking for a better packaging if you're planning on gifting them!

### [Macy's Blue Topaz Stud Earrings in 10K Yellow Gold](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Blue+Topaz+Earrings?utm\_term=macys-blue-topaz-stud-earrings-in-10k-yellow-gold)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Blue+Topaz+Earrings?utm_term=macys-blue-topaz-stud-earrings-in-10k-yellow-gold"><img alt="macys-gemstone-stud-earrings-in-10k-yellow-gold-blue-topaz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/macys-gemstone-stud-earrings-in-10k-yellow-gold-blue-topaz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Macy's Gemstone Stud Earrings in 10K Yellow Gold - Blue Topaz, and I must say, these little beauties add a touch of elegance to any outfit. The earrings are well-made and have a pear shape design, which I found to be a nice change from the usual round studs. The blue topaz stones are radiant and truly sparkle, making them stand out and catch everyone's attention. 

However, there are a few downsides to note. The posts are quite thin and could easily bend, which is a bit concerning for their durability. Additionally, some reviewers mentioned that the gemstones fell off the earrings, which isn't a great experience for someone looking to invest in a quality pair of studs. 

Overall, I think these earrings are a great addition to any jewelry collection, especially for those who appreciate a touch of sparkle in their everyday life. But be sure to handle them with care, as the thin posts might not withstand much pressure.
