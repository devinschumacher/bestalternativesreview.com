As a lover of dogs, I've tried countless dog foods in search of the perfect one. Recently, I came across Blue Buffalo's Life Protection Formula with an adult chicken and brown rice recipe. Having a fussy eater in my hands, I was curious to see if my furry friend would appreciate its taste. 

The first thing that stood out to me was the packaging. It was sturdy and the right size, making portioning easy and mess-free. The food itself was visually appealing, with well-cooked chicken chunks and a mix of whole grains and wholesome veggies that provided an inviting aroma. 

Upon feeding my dog, it was great to see him gobble down the meal without hesitation. The kibble size was perfect for his small jaw and teeth, making it a breeze for him to chew and enjoy. Moreover, the addition of super 7 antioxidant-rich ingredients in the form of LifeSource Bits proved that this was a high-quality, well-crafted meal. 

However, I did notice a downside â€“ the smell. After my dog finished eating, I found that the food had a lingering, unpleasant odor that was difficult to eliminate from his food bowl. It was something I had to get used to, as I believe it was caused by the high concentration of beneficial ingredients in the kibble. 

Another thing I noticed was that the food seemed a bit difficult to digest, as my dog would often need a few days to recover from any gastrointestinal issues following a meal. Although this wasn't an immediate concern, it left me slightly worried about its long-term effects on his health. 

In conclusion, the Blue Buffalo Life Protection Formula was an overall hit for my dog, with its tasty chicken and brown rice recipe ensuring that my fussy furry friend enjoyed his meal. The small kibble size and addition of super 7 antioxidant-rich ingredients were notable positives, however, the unpleasant smell and possible digestive challenges were factors to consider. Nonetheless, I would recommend this product to other dog owners looking for a quality, wholesome meal for their pets.

I was eager to try Blue Buffalo Blue Life Protection Formula for my new puppy who is at a critical stage in her development. The product caught my attention with its focus on supporting my puppy's healthy growth and development, but also because it contains real meat, fruits, and vegetables. 

My puppy seemed to enjoy the meal at first, but the experience took a turn for the worse. Soon after, she started experiencing loose stool and I became worried. While she initially ate the food with great enthusiasm, she soon started disliking it and would refuse to eat. I couldn't help but feel frustrated by this as I wanted a food that was both healthy and well-received by my puppy. 

On the positive side, I did appreciate the variety of ingredients and that the product was made by a company based in the United States. Additionally, the packaging was easy to open and the portions were easy to serve. 

Overall, though, Blue Buffalo Blue Life Protection Formula for puppies did not meet my expectations. The negative side effects it had on my puppy's digestive health and her refusal to eat led me to look for an alternative food that suited her preferences better.
