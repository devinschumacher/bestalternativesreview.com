<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Cute+Pill+Case?utm_term=bexeen-adorable-travel-pill-caddy-case"><img alt="travel-pill-container-box-for-purse-pill-organizer-small-travel-pill-case-moisture-proof-vitamin-med-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/travel-pill-container-box-for-purse-pill-organizer-small-travel-pill-case-moisture-proof-vitamin-med-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Recently, I decided to give the BEXEEN Travel Pill Container Box for Purse a try on my daily routine. It's not the largest case out there, having a practical size of 4 inches long, 3 inches wide, and 1.5 inches tall. Despite its size, it boasts an impressive 7 compartments for storing all those little vitamins or meds. 

Upon my first use, I found out that it is a moisture-proof design. This is not a characteristic I was actively seeking, but its ability to protect my pills from spilling or getting damaged is now one of my favorite features of this tiny pill organizer.

Despite these minor flaws, this small but convenient pill case can be a lifesaver, considering I now always carry my pills safely, thanks to those water-resistant walls that protect them from moisture. For a cute and efficient travel pill organizer, this tiny case gets a thumbs up from me.
