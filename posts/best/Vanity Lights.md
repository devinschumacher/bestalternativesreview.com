Upon first glance, the light fixture exuded an air of sophistication with its clear swirl glass shades and natural brass finish. It was a perfect blend of modern design and classical charm.

The light fixture itself was quite straightforward to install, requiring only a few simple hand tools. I was grateful for this simplicity, as it allowed me to focus on the design instead of getting bogged down by the installation process. Additionally, the fixture came with a one-year manufacturer's warranty, which added a sense of security and confidence in my purchase. 

One potential drawback I noticed was that the matte black finish seemed a bit prone to scratches. However, I found this to be a minor concern, as it was easy to fix if any scratches did occur. Furthermore, the light fixture felt a bit lightweight, which made me wonder about its durability in a humid environment. Despite these concerns, the vanity light added charm and an ambiance to my bathroom that was well worth the investment.

### [Merington Brushed Nickel Vanity Light Bar - 5 Lights with Frosted Opal Glass Shades](https://serp.ly/amazon/Vanity+Lights?utm\_term=merington-brushed-nickel-vanity-light-bar-5-lights-with-frosted-opal-glass-shades)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Vanity+Lights?utm_term=merington-brushed-nickel-vanity-light-bar-5-lights-with-frosted-opal-glass-shades"><img alt="allen-roth-merington-5-light-nickel-transitional-vanity-light-bar-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/allen-roth-merington-5-light-nickel-transitional-vanity-light-bar-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently installed the Allen + Roth Merington 5-Light Vanity Light Bar in my bathroom and I must say, it was a bit of a challenge to put together. The first hurdle I faced was that the instructions provided were not detailed enough, which made it difficult to identify which parts belong where. However, I managed to figure it out eventually. 

Once assembled, I was impressed with the brushed nickel finish of the light bar. It definitely added a chic, timeless touch to my bathroom decor. The frosted opal glass shades also gave off a soft, warm glow, which added to the ambiance. 

However, I did notice that the glass shades were hand painted, which can lead to slight variations in color and texture. This may not be an issue for some people, but it did bother me a bit. 

One downside I encountered was that the light bulbs required for this fixture were not included, which meant I had to purchase them separately. While I understand that this is a common practice, it can be a bit inconvenient for customers who are not prepared for it. 

The five 60-watt A19 bulbs required for this fixture can be installed either facing up or down, depending on personal preference. Additionally, it is fully dimmable, providing control over the ambiance created in the room. 

One final note, the mounting hardware included for easy installation was inadequate. I had difficulty securing the light bar to the wall, which led to a sense of instability. It's a little concerning, especially given the expense of the fixture. 

Overall, while the Allen + Roth Merington 5-Light Vanity Light Bar is an attractive addition to any bathroom, its quality lighting is marred by a few drawbacks, including lack of detail in the instructions and concerns about sturdiness.

## Buyer's Guide

When it comes to illuminating the space around your mirror, whether for grooming, applying makeup, or shaving, a good set of vanity lights can make all the difference. Not only do they provide ample light for seeing detail, but they also add a touch of elegance and sophistication to your bathroom. In this buyer's guide, we'll discuss the key features to consider, practical considerations, and general advice for choosing the right vanity lights for your needs. 


### Light Type

When choosing vanity lights, there are a few different lighting types to consider, including LED, halogen, and fluorescent. Each type has its advantages and disadvantages, so it's essential to choose the one that best suits your needs. For example, LED lights tend to be more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly, while halogen lights often offer a warmer, more flattering light for the face. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Vanity+Lights"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Vanity-Lights-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Vanity-Lights-2" height="540"></a></div>


### Light Output and Brightness

Light output and brightness are critical factors to consider when selecting vanity lights. Ideally, you want enough light to see your reflection clearly, but not so much that it feels harsh or overly bright. Consider the size of the area you'll be illuminating and the wattage of the bulbs you'll be using to ensure you have an appropriate light output. 


### Color Temperature

Color temperature refers to the "warmth" or "coolness" of the light emitted by the vanity lights. A lower color temperature (measured in Kelvin) tends to create a warmer, more flattering light for the face. On the other hand, a higher color temperature will produce a cooler, more neutral light. It's essential to choose a light with the right color temperature to help you see your reflection accurately and minimize eye strain. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Vanity+Lights"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Vanity-Lights-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Vanity-Lights-3" height="540"></a></div>


### Installation and Mounting Options

Finally, consider the installation and mounting options of the vanity lights you're interested in. Most vanity lights come with a variety of mounting options, including wall-mounted, ceiling-mounted, or even plug-in models. Make sure you choose a model that suits your bathroom's design and layout and is easy to install and maintain. 


## FAQ

### What are vanity lights?

Vanity lights are specially designed lighting fixtures that offer the ideal illumination for tasks like makeup application, shaving, or grooming. They are typically mounted on a wall or mirror and come with adjustable brightness and direction, ensuring users can see their reflection clearly and accurately. Popular vanity light options comprise sconces, flush-mounted fixtures, and pendants. These lights are available in various styles, from traditional to modern, making them suitable for a wide array of bathrooms and powder rooms. 

Vanity lights are essential for creating a well-lit and comfortable space for daily self-care routines. They significantly enhance any bathroom design's overall decor and functionality. Due to their versatility and usefulness, vanity lights have recently become increasingly popular for both residential and commercial use. 


### Are LED vanity lights a good choice?

LED vanity lights are an excellent choice for several reasons. They provide energy-efficient and long-lasting illumination. Most LED vanity lights last up to 20,000 hours or more, helping you save money on replacement costs and energy bills. Moreover, LED lights do not emit harsh UV or infrared radiation, preventing skin damage and premature aging. Furthermore, LED vanity lights offer a wide range of color temperature options, allowing users to get the perfect light for their specific needs. 

Another substantial advantage of LED vanity lights is their ability to provide directional light with focused beams, minimizing glare and providing better visibility. Overall, LED vanity lights are a premium and energy-efficient choice, offering numerous benefits for both the user and the environment.

### What is the optimum wattage for a vanity light?

The ideal wattage for a vanity light can vary depending on several factors such as the room's size, desired brightness, and personal preferences. Typically, a wattage range of 20-75 watts is recommended for most vanity lights. However, it is essential to consider the light source's efficiency and quality as well. LED vanity lights are much more efficient than their traditional counterparts, requiring less power to produce the same brightness. 

If you are uncertain about the ideal wattage for your specific vanity light, it's recommended to consult with a lighting expert or the product's manufacturer. They can offer expert advice on choosing the right wattage for the space and its intended use, ensuring optimal performance and energy efficiency. 


### How do I install a vanity light?

Installing a vanity light can be a relatively straightforward process, especially if you are comfortable with basic home improvement tasks. It's crucial to follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety guidelines, including turning off the power in the area where the installation is taking place. If you are unsure about any aspect of the installation process, it's always a good idea to consult with a professional electrician or the manufacturer for additional guidance. 

For most vanity lights, you will need to install a junction box or mounting bracket onto the wall or mirror, depending on the fixture's design. Next, connect the electrical wiring, ensuring proper wire connections and securing the fixture in place. Properly securing the light will prevent any potential hazards, such as falling or damage to the fixture. Additionally, use insulated screws, wire nuts, and electrical tape to ensure a safe and secure connection.

### How frequently should I clean my vanity light?

The frequency of cleaning your vanity light will depend on various factors, such as the amount of use, level of humidity, and personal preferences. Generally, vanity lights should be cleaned at least once a week, or as needed, to maintain optimal functionality and appearance. This includes wiping away any dust, dirt, or moisture accumulation from the light's surface. 

It's also important to clean the lightbulbs occasionally to ensure their performance is not compromised by buildup of dust or debris. A simple solution of soapy water and a soft cloth can effectively clean both the light fixture and the bulbs. By keeping your vanity light clean and well-maintained, you can enjoy better illumination and a more attractive bathroom or powder room design. 


### Should I opt for a bathroom vanity with integrated lighting?

Whether you should choose an integrated lighting system within your bathroom vanity depends on your unique needs, preferences, and space constraints. Integrated lighting systems offer convenience due to their built-in design, simplifying installation and creating a streamlined appearance in the bathroom. Additionally, integrated lighting systems often provide various lighting options, such as task lighting and ambient lighting, offering the perfect illumination for various activities. 

However, choosing a separate vanity light allows for more flexibility in terms of style, brightness, and placement. If you prefer the ability to adjust the lighting according to your specific needs or desire a more decorative or statement light fixture, a separate vanity light might be the better option. Ultimately, the choice between a separate vanity light and an integrated lighting system should be based on your unique requirements and preferences.
