## Buyer's Guide

Coil spring spacers are essential components for adjusting ride height and maintaining proper suspension alignment in vehicles. These spacers sit between the coil spring and the wheel hub, providing a simple yet effective solution for various suspension modifications. Understanding their specifications and applications will help you select the right spacers for your vehicle. 


### Material and Construction

Most coil spring spacers are made from high-quality metal alloys, including stainless steel and aluminum. The material determines the spacer's weight, durability, and resistance to corrosion. Stainless steel spacers offer superior rust resistance and are ideal for both street and off-road applications, while aluminum spacers provide excellent strength-to-weight ratio for performance vehicles.

### Diameter and Width

The spacer's outer diameter must match your specific vehicle's wheel and suspension design. Standard diameters range from 3.25 inches to 4 inches, but some specialty applications may require custom sizes. The spacer's width affects its height addition and should be selected based on your desired ride height adjustment and existing suspension components. 


### Height Adjustment and Fitment

Each spacer adds a specific height increment, typically ranging from 1/4 to 1 inch per piece. Calculate your total adjustment needs based on stock ride height and desired results. Consider the overall stack height when selecting multiple spacers, as excessive height can affect suspension geometry and clearance.

### Installation and Maintenance

Proper installation requires careful measurement and alignment tools. The spacer should sit flush against the spring and wheel hub with no visible gaps. Regular inspection is necessary to check for wear, corrosion, or deformation. Always consult your vehicle's manual and consider professional installation for complex suspension systems. 


## FAQ

![Coil-Spring-Spacers-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Coil-Spring-Spacers-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is the primary function of coil spring spacers?

Coil spring spacers are metal washers that fit between coil springs to adjust vehicle suspension height. They help maintain proper ride height, improve handling, and prevent excessive sagging, especially in older vehicles or those with sagging suspensions. 

These spacers are crucial for maintaining proper tire clearance, especially important when changing tires or fitting lifted suspensions. They prevent contact between the tire and frame or bodypanels, which can cause damage and reduced vehicle performance. 


### What are the main benefits of using coil spring spacers?

Using coil spring spacers provides several key benefits. They help maintain the correct ride height, which is essential for proper vehicle alignment and performance. Proper ride height helps prevent body lean during cornering and maintains consistent tire contact with the road. 

Spacers also improve suspension function by ensuring that the springs maintain their original design height. This can help extend the life of your suspension components and improve overall vehicle handling characteristics. 

![Coil-Spring-Spacers-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Coil-Spring-Spacers-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Are there any installation concerns when using coil spring spacers?

When installing coil spring spacers, it's important to ensure that the total stack height of the springs remains within the manufacturer's specifications for your vehicle. Too much height can affect tire clearance and vehicle stability. 

Always double-check your vehicle's ride height before and after installation to ensure it's within the recommended range. Proper alignment and spring rate matching with the rest of the suspension are also crucial for optimal performance and safety. 


### Can coil spring spacers be used on all vehicles?

Coil spring spacers can be used on most vehicles with coil spring suspension systems, but compatibility depends on the specific vehicle model and year. Refer to your vehicle's repair manual or a professional mechanic to determine if spacers are suitable for your vehicle. 

Some older or modified vehicles may have specific requirements or restrictions. It's important to verify that the spacers you choose are compatible with your vehicle's suspension design and spring rate. 

![Coil-Spring-Spacers-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Coil-Spring-Spacers-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do I know if my vehicle needs coil spring spacers?

If your vehicle's ride height has dropped significantly over time, you may need coil spring spacers to restore proper suspension geometry and ride height. Signs that your vehicle may benefit from spacers include visible sagging, poor tire contact with the road, or loss of handling stability. 

A qualified mechanic can perform a thorough inspection to determine if your vehicle's suspension needs height adjustment. They can measure ride height and check for proper suspension component clearance to advise on the appropriate course of action. 


### What factors should I consider when selecting coil spring spacers?

When selecting coil spring spacers, consider the specific dimensions required for your vehicle model and year. Also, ensure the spacers are made from suitable materials that can handle the weight and forces of your vehicle's suspension. 

Factor in your intended use and vehicle modifications. If you're planning significant modifications or lifted suspensions, you may need spacers specifically designed for those applications. Always choose high-quality spacers from reputable manufacturers to ensure safety and performance.
