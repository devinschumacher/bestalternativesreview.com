## Buyer's Guide

Corner coat racks are an efficient way to store coats, bags, and accessories in apartments or homes with limited wall space. These multi-tiered racks maximize vertical storage by utilizing otherwise wasted corner space. When selecting a corner coat rack, consider the following key factors to find the right piece for your needs. 


### Size and Space

Measure the corner where you plan to install the rack, including the height and width available. Corner coat racks typically come in sizes ranging from 30 inches to 60 inches in total height. Consider the width between the arms, which usually measures between 18 to 36 inches. Ensure there's enough space between the rack and other furniture for easy access. 

![Corner-Coat-Rack-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Corner-Coat-Rack-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Supported Weight

Check the weight capacity rating for your chosen rack, as it varies based on the material and design. Metal racks generally support more weight than wooden ones. For heavy items like winter coats or bags, look for a rating of at least 50 pounds per tier. This capacity will vary between different tiers, with heavier-duty tiers closer to the floor. 


### Stability and Construction

While corner coat racks are designed to be stable, the construction quality affects their durability. Check if the rack has spreader bars or feet to distribute weight and prevent tipping. The arms should be securely attached to the base, either through welding for metal racks or strong joints for wood. Avoid racks with wobbly joints or loose arms as they may not support their weight evenly. 

![Corner-Coat-Rack-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Corner-Coat-Rack-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Style and Materials

Corner coat racks come in various styles and materials, from sleek metal finishes to rustic wood designs. Consider your room's existing decor and choose a style that matches. The materials impact both appearance and functionality - metal racks resist moisture and heavy use, while wood adds warmth but requires regular maintenance. 


## FAQ

![Corner-Coat-Rack-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Corner-Coat-Rack-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a corner coat rack?

A corner coat rack is a specialized piece of furniture designed to maximize storage space in tight corners. By utilizing the often wasted triangular space between walls, these racks efficiently hold coats, jackets, and other outerwear, keeping them organized and accessible. 

Most corner coat racks feature hooks and shelves, allowing you to hang and store items vertically as well as place items flat on the surfaces. The ergonomic design of these racks makes them suitable for entryways, mudrooms, and small apartments where space is limited. 


### How much weight can a corner coat rack support?

Standard corner coat racks can support between 20-50 pounds per rack, depending on the model. This weight capacity includes both hooks and shelves combined. It's important to check the specific rating for the rack you're considering, as heavier items like coats with metal hardware might have reduced capacity. 

For safety and durability, always distribute weights evenly across the rack and avoid overloading any single hook or shelf. If you plan to hang heavier items, consider a rack with reinforced construction or a higher weight rating. 

![Corner-Coat-Rack-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Corner-Coat-Rack-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What materials are corner coat racks typically made of?

Most corner coat racks are constructed from metal, specifically aluminum or steel, due to their strength and durability. These materials resist corrosion and can support heavier loads. Some budget-friendly options may use plastic or composite materials, but these are less common for reliable, long-term use. 

Higher-end models often incorporate wood for the facing panels, combining the natural aesthetic appeal of wood with metal construction for improved durability. Composite materials that blend metal and wood elements are also available, providing both strength and visual appeal. 


### How do I measure for a corner coat rack?

To measure for a corner coat rack, start by determining the exact angle of the corner where you plan to install it. Most racks are designed for 90-degree corners, but some models can accommodate 95-degree angles. Measure the distance between the two walls forming the corner to determine the rack's width and height dimensions. 

Additionally, measure the length of the free space along the walls that will be used for hooks and shelves. This measurement helps ensure the rack fits properly and provides enough storage space for your needs. Consider adding 1-2 inches to your measurements for any necessary clearance around the rack. 

![Corner-Coat-Rack-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Corner-Coat-Rack-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the key features to look for in a corner coat rack?

When selecting a corner coat rack, consider features like adjustable hooks, multiple storage levels, and built-in baskets or shelves. Adjustable hooks allow you to customize the rack for different items and sizes, while multiple storage levels maximize vertical space. Built-in baskets are convenient for storing smaller items like gloves and hats. 

Look for racks with anti-tip features, such as weighted bases or anchors that attach to the wall. These safety features prevent the rack from tipping over, especially in households with children or pets. Additionally, consider racks with LED lighting options for evening visibility and enhanced styling. 


### How do I install a corner coat rack?

Most modern corner coat racks come with wall-mounting hardware and detailed installation instructions. Start by measuring and marking the wall where the rack will go, then drill pilot holes for the provided anchors. Insert anchors and attach the mounting plates securely to the wall using included screws. 

To install the rack, align it with your marks and attach the mounting points to the wall. Some racks require additional L-brackets or corner pieces to secure them properly. Once mounted, attach the hooks and shelves according to the manufacturer's instructions. Double-check all connections for stability before using the rack.
