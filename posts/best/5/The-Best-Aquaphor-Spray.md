## FAQ

![Aquaphor-Spray-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Aquaphor-Spray-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is Aquaphor Spray?

Aquaphor Spray is a specialized skin care product that combines the healing properties of Aquaphor Healing Ointment with an adjustable moisture delivery system through its spray format. This allows users to apply the rich, protective formula where needed while controlling the amount of product used. 

The spray version maintains the key components of Aquaphor Healing Ointment, including petrolatum and mineral-based ingredients that form a protective barrier over the skin, lock in moisture, and create an optimal environment for healing. 


### When should I use Aquaphor Spray?

Use Aquaphor Spray on clean, dry skin whenever you need added moisture and protection. It's particularly effective after bath or shower, on cuts and minor injuries to keep them moist and protected, and for sensitive skin conditions that benefit from barrier protection. 

It's ideal for overnight use to prevent skin from drying out during sleep, and for daytime use to protect irritated skin from external irritants. The spray form makes it convenient for hard-to-reach areas and for quick touch-ups throughout the day. 

![Aquaphor-Spray-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Aquaphor-Spray-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the key benefits of Aquaphor Spray?

The primary benefit of Aquaphor Spray is its ability to deliver an efficacious amount of healing ointment directly to the skin while preserving its integrity. Unlike other sprays that may contain volatile ingredients, Aquaphor Spray maintains its thick, protective consistency, making it particularly useful for sensitive skin and chronic conditions. 

Its key ingredients of petrolatum and mineral-based substances create a long-lasting moisture barrier and help prevent transepidermal water loss, which is crucial for maintaining skin health and preventing dryness. 


### How is Aquaphor Spray different from other sprays on the market?

Aquaphor Spray stands out due to its consistent, non-volatile formula that retains the protective properties of traditional Aquaphor Healing Ointment. Unlike many other sprays that use lighter, more volatile ingredients, the spray form of Aquaphor delivers a rich, protective layer that's particularly effective for sensitive skin and chronic conditions. 

The spray mechanism specifically developed for Aquaphor makes it suitable for both precise application in small areas and quick application over larger surfaces, with minimal mess and controlled dosage. 

![Aquaphor-Spray-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Aquaphor-Spray-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How long does Aquaphor Spray last?

Like traditional Aquaphor Healing Ointment, the spray formula has a long shelf life when properly sealed and stored. The typical shelf life is 2 years unopened and 6 months after opening, though these can vary based on storage conditions. Always check the expiration date before use and store the product in a cool, dry place to maintain its effectiveness. 

Each application lasts several hours to a full day depending on skin type and environmental factors. The spray makes it particularly efficient to treat larger areas or multiple spots, allowing you to use less product while providing the same level of protection and healing benefits. 


### Can Aquaphor Spray be used on sensitive skin?

The rich, protective formula of Aquaphor Spray makes it exceptionally suitable for sensitive skin. The mineral-based ingredients are less likely to cause irritation compared to some chemical-laden products, and the spray mechanism allows for precise application to avoid over-saturating delicate areas. 

It's particularly beneficial for conditions like eczema, psoriasis, and other chronic skin issues that require regular barrier protection. Always perform a patch test on a small area before full application to ensure compatibility.
