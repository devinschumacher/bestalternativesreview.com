![Magic Chef HMM1110B Countertop Microwave | Image](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcTs7TdxuX4lhgwq9cjkKaHCoX17jGE6YmPjzmhSQqwNqp0KMI04chPHrRtBN14C30UT6DCBR\_XHSlPoUXSfkb8\_e5Z22CiEew&usqp=CAY)

At just 30 inches deep, this countertop microwave hugs your counter while its 1.1-cu. -ft. capacity stretches to fit everything from casseroles to single dishes. The five 1-touch cooking menus and three auto-defrost options make mealtime breeze, and the powerful 1000-Watt bake gives every dish that homemade touch. 


### [Hamilton Beach 1.1 Cu. ft. Black Countertop Microwave](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Hamilton+Beach+Microwave?utm\_term=hamilton-beach-1-1-cu-ft-black-countertop-microwave)

![Hamilton Beach 1.1 Cu. ft. Black Countertop Microwave | Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ0XAG5Gy5yfRPpuz5z7LgtVIDL5otETHK9imbmVCLCFRODM5H15i-pbbOEtjLB1HSTvuqaIaZnZ75zE2iwLca0m9JNgVPM10GNWm7MSkiQhm\_6bpvbTu4F&usqp=CAY)

This basic black countertop microwave packs 1,000 watts of cooking power into an affordable package that fits perfectly in any kitchen. At just 1.1 cubic feet, it's not the biggest microwave around, but it gets the job done with nine power levels and simple one-touch controls. The glass turntable keeps food moving while it heats up. While it lacks convection cooking, the straightforward design makes it a practical choice for everyday microwave tasks. 


### [Insignia Sensor Microwave Oven](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Hamilton+Beach+Microwave?utm\_term=insignia-sensor-microwave-oven)

![Insignia Sensor Microwave Oven | Image](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ\_7j0GJL6IWU0OWBHiqa2TnMq7xwqI3NSA12j2g3safU0QrJGeRD681tWXYTxhWGL1cd-0YkpIJJ4f0E4gm\_bwiziQI9z-zA&usqp=CAY)

Notable as much for what's missing in the way of features - like the absence of genuine customer reviews or actual specs beyond basic dimensions - this 1.1-cubic-foot microwave leans heavily into its aesthetic appeal with a white frost exterior and premium matte-finish metal casing. While it does offer some basic convenience with its 15 digital preset functions and sensor technology for cooking and reheating, the overall execution seems to fall short, particularly in terms of basic performance metrics like heating capabilities. 


### [Hamilton Beach 0.9 cu ft 900W Red Countertop Microwave](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Hamilton+Beach+Microwave?utm\_term=hamilton-beach-0-9-cu-ft-900w-red-countertop-microwave)

This red Hamilton Beach microwave packs a noticeable presence on the countertop, with its sleek stainless steel front panel and generous 0.9-cubic-foot capacity. The 900-watt appliance handles everything from quick cat-food heats to potato dinners, though larger frozen meals might need extra time. While some users love its modern looks and convenient controls, others have found it inconsistent, with food sometimes coming out burnt or frozen in spots. Overall, it's a solid performer for everyday microwave tasks.

This Hamilton Beach microwave has certainly captured my interest with its generous 1.1 cu ft capacity and 1000W power output, but those 1360 reviews are making me a bit nervous – not least because nearly half of them warn about durability issues like peeling paint and rusting interior components.

Combining microwave, convection oven, and air fryer functions in one compact appliance, this Hamilton Beach model offers versatile cooking options for small spaces. While the air fry feature delivers decent results with healthier oil-free cooking, the overall performance leaves room for improvement, particularly with longer cook times and inconsistent food temperatures. The glass turntable tends to judder during operation, potentially causing damage and safety concerns. 


## Buyer's Guide

Hamilton Beach offers a variety of microwave models with different features and capacities. When selecting a microwave from this brand, consider factors such as cooking capacity, power level, additional features, and energy efficiency to find a model that fits your kitchen and culinary needs.

Some models include child-lock safety features, while others offer preset cooking programs for common dishes. The number of settings available can affect how versatile the microwave is for your cooking needs.
