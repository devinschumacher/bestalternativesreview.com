## Buyer's Guide

Homitt electric spin scrubbers offer an efficient solution for cleaning a variety of surfaces. Understanding key features and considerations will help you select the right model for your needs. 


### Capacity and Dimensions

Consider the size of the areas you need to clean when selecting a capacity. Common sizes range from 12 to 15 gallons, suitable for both home and commercial use. Check the dimensions to ensure the unit fits through your doors and storage space.
