## Buyer's Guide

### Key Notes and Fragrance Families

Dolce & Gabbana perfumes prominently feature Mediterranean and floral notes. Their fragrance families include classic women's scents like floral, woody, and vanilla-based perfumes, as well as more contemporary options incorporating modern interpretations of traditional scents. 


### Gender-Specific Scent Characteristics

The gender-specific scent profiles are evident in both women's and men's fragrances. Women's perfumes often emphasize floral and fruity notes, while men's scents feature more spicy, woody, and citrusy accords. However, many modern offerings blend these traditional gender lines. 


### Longevity and Sillage

Understanding a perfume's longevity (how long it lasts on the skin) and sillage (how strongly it's perceived by others) is crucial. Higher concentrations in perfumes typically offer greater staying power and projection. Consider your daily activities and social interactions when selecting a scent's longevity. 


### Size and Packaging Considerations

Purchasing a smaller tester bottle allows you to sample a fragrance before committing to a larger size. The packaging material also affects longevity; fragrance should be stored in dark glass bottles to protect the scent from light and air exposure.
