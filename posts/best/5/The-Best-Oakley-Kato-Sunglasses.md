## FAQ


### What are the Oakley Kato Sunglasses made of?

The Oakley Kato features a lightweight O Matter frame with hydrophilic temples that adapt to your head shape. The temples contain a flexible, hydrophilic material that helps maintain a secure fit while providing comfort during various activities. 

The lenses are standard grey smoke UV400 protection with polarized coating, ensuring both style and functionality. The frame utilizes Oakley's QuietHinge technology at the temples for reduced frame movement and enhanced comfort during intense activities. 


### How do the Kato Sunglasses perform in strong winds?

The hydrophilic temples form a tight seal against the back of your head, preventing unnecessary movement and ensuring consistent fit during windy conditions. The combination of O Matter frame material and QuietHinge technology helps maintain structural integrity while reducing frame flex. 

Users report that the Katos stay firmly in place during windy conditions, though as with any sunglasses, effective wind protection is also influenced by proper lens selection (e. g. , wraparound styles) and head positioning. 


### Are these sunglasses suitable for water sports?

While not designed as dedicated water sports sunglasses, the Kato's polarized lenses and UV400 protection make them suitable for reflective surface environments like water. The hydrophilic temple design helps prevent fogging during initial water exposure. 

However, for dedicated water sports, consider models specifically designed for splash resistance and durability against saltwater and chlorine. The Kato's primary focus is on general lifestyle and recreational use. 


### How do the Kato Sunglasses compare to Oakley's higher-end models?

The Kato offers a balance of performance features found in Oakley's broader lineup, such as polarized lenses and UV protection, without the premium price point of higher-end models like the Oakley Flak 2.0. It lacks some advanced features found in the Flak 2.0, such as interchangeable lenses and proprietary lens coatings. 

At a more affordable tier, the Kato competes with other top-tier sunglasses brands in terms of protection and optical clarity, offering a solid compromise between performance and cost. 


### Can these sunglasses be customized with prescription lenses?

No, the Kato sunglasses cannot be customized with prescription lenses. Oakley frames with interchangeable prescription inserts typically require different models specifically designed for this feature, like the Oakley Socket or Socket One. 

For prescription Oakley sunglasses, consider models that include prescription inserts as part of their design, such as the Oakley Flak 2.0 or Oakley Indicator, which offer dedicated prescription options. 


### What should I consider when buying Oakley Kato Sunglasses?

Check the frame size chart to ensure a proper fit, as Oakley measurements differ from standard metrics. Consider your primary use case - daily wear, sports, or specific activities - to guide your selection of lens color and coatings. 

While the Kato performs well in various conditions, consider factors like temple shape preference, weather resistance needs, and budget when evaluating if these sunglasses meet your specific requirements.
