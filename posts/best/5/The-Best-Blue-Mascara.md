### [Yves Saint Laurent Mascara Volume Effet Faux Cils #03 Extreme Blue](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Blue+Mascara?utm\_term=yves-saint-laurent-mascara-volume-effet-faux-cils-03-extreme-blue)

This blue-hued mascara delivers intense length and volume through a triple-film complex that coats, conditions, and fixes your lashes. The soft black shade works wonders for adding length to naturally dark lashes while complementing gray hair. The brush features nylon fibers that fortify the volume effect, though some users suggest it works best with multiple coats. 


### [L'Oreal Paris Voluminous Lash Paradise Moonlight Mascara](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Blue+Mascara?utm\_term=loreal-paris-voluminous-lash-paradise-moonlight-mascara)

The deep navy shade with soft reflections brings intense volume to your lashes, while the smooth glide formula keeps application easy and the look incredibly soft to touch. With over 200 bristles in the specialized brush, every lash gets noticed without the clumping that can make mascara messy. Perfect for both everyday wear and Halloween looks, this mascara delivers the volumizing power you love in a rich, dark finish that coats your lashes in glossy intensity. 


### [Golden Rose Perfect Lashes Blue Mascara](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Blue+Mascara?utm\_term=golden-rose-perfect-lashes-blue-mascara)

![Golden Rose Perfect Lashes Blue Mascara | Image](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcQhkVHS8k2spGzgtjpBKehlvAe7dr2WLqxAd\_NAcjNLFEg7KM\_vMh5iVL965Eq2ltRH33ageod1xPD4wU2lqbLrDKRq5XWpfw&usqp=CAY)

This blue mascara packs serious pigment without clumping, giving your lashes a dramatic lift while keeping them amazingly manageable. The creamy formula makes application a breeze, and it pairs wonderfully with the natural beauty of blue eyes. While a few users noted it can dry out slightly, the majority adore its vibrant shade and lasting power. 


### [LGSZGDCN Blue Lashes Extensions Mascara](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Blue+Mascara?utm\_term=lgszgdcn-blue-lashes-extensions-mascara)

![LGSZGDCN Blue Lashes Extensions Mascara | Image](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ0oLnVrHXJEAmRDfueAGPTSZ3v92IaS5f\_fPgOrFL22b\_fkE1ZdC-c6nOWl-o0de\_J3bH3levQBsYxx2\_BY-duXAeqBNPl&usqp=CAY)

Unlike some clumping mascaras out there, these blue extensions keep your lashes defined and separated - kind of like giving your natural lashes a perm at the gym. The soft-bristled brush works magic on every lash, from root to tip, without that heavy-makeup look. While they're not waterproof (says the person who cries at sad movies), they're pretty gentle and easy to remove at the end of the day. 


### [TWLBXMG Blue Mascara](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Blue+Mascara?utm\_term=twlbxmg-blue-mascara)

![TWLBXMG Blue Mascara | Image](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcTbzgzfW-s-i1Cg1oz8CtyGurKfxc8vWrjf2oD-AqCxSkvV1tERvH\_EDiavzL\_Iam54fAIiVWsL5hemxQYxT7t0qetOCdI4Wg&usqp=CAY)

This blue mascara combines natural ingredients with a unique brush design that separates and defines lashes from root to tip.

This creamy mascara builds volume while keeping lashes defined and separated, with a brush that glides smoothly for buildable color intensity. The electric blue shade adds a bold pop of color without overpowering natural lashes. While some users note it works best on shorter lashes, the formula's blendability makes touch-ups simple. 


### [Color Mascara #4 Sky Blue](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Blue+Mascara?utm\_term=color-mascara-4-sky-blue)

![Color Mascara #4 Sky Blue | Image](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ4TGOPNh6U7JY0DO5AQtv1AJgrzaZwfdG4I6nVPtZDlliKyA13CiUcr9sG1VOMYM0GIkUd\_Nz71Y\_LxoL9naniWFvvXxHP6w&usqp=CAY)

The Color Mascara #4 Sky Blue brings natural moisture to lashes while providing long-lasting waterproof pigmentation. At just 8g, the mascara offers buildable volume without clumping, though some users note the thin wand requires careful handling.

### [LGSZGDCN Blue Lashes Mascara](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Blue+Mascara?utm\_term=lgszgdcn-blue-lashes-mascara)

![LGSZGDCN Blue Lashes Mascara | Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcQcYnE7RwyyiBzKARRQViFVlv5K-eGp3yEk50tfJkXGqR8ldiUS-vGxJfkgq3nE31SUYFJ80KyRdyuROz6rHjgob9Ln6HyI&usqp=CAY)

This blue mascara combines volumizing and lengthening properties in a single brush design that bends to coat every lash from root to tip. Thanks to its conical fiber brush, each application delivers natural-looking volume without the clumping often associated with dramatic mascaras. The formula proves particularly effective on blue and green eyes, enhancing their natural color while providing all-day wear without the need for waterproof features. 


### [Maybelline Lash Sensational Sky High Mascara](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Blue+Mascara?utm\_term=maybelline-lash-sensational-sky-high-mascara)

![Maybelline Lash Sensational Sky High Mascara | Image](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcS2vMZ9ehmPuwqVykPHW4oyCGAFN1rBcwpuzrq5xVtXrJA335MhJq8f3wZiuwc1Q24aQv0AK70f\_-iDnQvYCpvQRi8N4Nmk3w&usqp=CAY)

This blue mist mascara delivers dramatic length and volume with its flex tower brush that works from root to tip. The bamboo extract formula keeps lashes light and manageable, while the ophthalmologist-tested mascara washes off easily. The vivid blue shade gives eyes a pop while staying true to natural lash length. 


### [NYX Color Mascara Blue](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Blue+Mascara?utm\_term=nyx-color-mascara-blue)

![NYX Color Mascara Blue | Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcTueppfBvXMopz2IY2SfuHtMiTduvEbJYOgl-hrKKXdBrRfNE7HWW5WziG9aIbeXUJoVih53W-mXCtafRWQaCXiX8vFAXVr&usqp=CAY)

The NYX Cosmetics Blue Mascara packs a punch with its vivid pigmentation, though some may need multiple coats to achieve the desired effect. While the formula clings stubbornly to lashes, creating a noticeable ombre effect when applied sparingly at the lash tips, its thin, poorly designed brush makes precise application challenging. Overall, it's a polarizing product that either wins big with its intense color payoff or leaves users frustrated by its difficult application and removal process. 


### [La Girl Volumatic Mascara, Extreme Bright Blue](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Blue+Mascara?utm\_term=la-girl-volumatic-mascara-extreme-bright-blue)

![La Girl Volumatic Mascara, Extreme Bright Blue | Image](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcTmGW3tcgfGROVlx-Vg8G2HpoWBGP\_RWtgRatpeC5OgSXG6RWf12KthSBx5vQkxG9yDJky570\_grQk7pXbjJY8zXiOAnk9H&usqp=CAY)

This water-resistant blue mascara delivers impressive length and volume with its special tubular formula that coats each lash individually. The petal-shaped brush glides smoothly across lashes, separating them perfectly without clumping. While some users note the formula can be a bit drying, the dramaticResults speak for themselves with plush, separated lashes in just one coat. 


### [Swell Season BFF Mascara in Blue](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Blue+Mascara?utm\_term=swell-season-bff-mascara-in-blue)

![Swell Season BFF Mascara in Blue | Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcTWi8rZ0IJGHtYvHtZgd\_7QAz4gmfIKBASHRTwzTKgx5GwEcrE6wBMQZnRSbRVFq1EKs\_6zlr8cGr3Lkh1GlznJhmULgUNn&usqp=CAY)

While a vibrant blue option isn't mentioned in these reviews, users have mixed feelings about Swell Season BFF Mascara overall. Some praise its color payoff and long wear, though many struggle with clumping, flaking, and a difficult-to-apply formula. The unique brush design helps prevent smudges, but the product can feel too dry for some lash types. 


### [Revolution Relove Volume Blue Mascara](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Blue+Mascara?utm\_term=revolution-relove-volume-blue-mascara)

![Revolution Relove Volume Blue Mascara | Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcTA805ymeue49Vt\_oW4EQ6w6OcJiBPF2DY8YgVOms6K7xHts9\_Xsot7XMxmK3D6c8JcpHOxT8nZFznzRdTsyfZ8aIXxAUfR9w&usqp=CAY)

The Revolution Relove Volume Blue Mascara has earned a solid reputation among users for its vibrant color payoff and reliable performance. Its unique formula provides significant length and volume in a single coat while featuring a surprisingly gentle eye makeup tool in its slim, effective brush design.

### [Loreal Voluminous Original Mascara, Cobalt Blue 900](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Blue+Mascara?utm\_term=loreal-voluminous-original-mascara-cobalt-blue-900)

![Loreal Voluminous Original Mascara, Cobalt Blue 900 | Image](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcT4W-Sr4DXyizHleCiyjpUUfxPfXF9obT6fwP\_PfTQi6DZ59\_Yv1ZQWVjhC0H03QdTNPLwPB1R3YqJc2QOBttSopmfCzfGG&usqp=CAY)

This classic blue mascara delivers impressive results with its formula that thickens and lengthens lashes up to five times their natural volume in just one coat. The expertly designed brush captures every lash, applying just the right amount of product for a soft, flake-free finish that won't clump or smudge.

## Buyer's Guide

Blue mascara adds a striking pop of color to your lashes, but selecting the right formula can mean the difference between vibrant results and smeared eyeshadow. This guide will help you choose a blue mascara that matches your desired intensity, provides adequate volume and length, and applies smoothly without clumping. 


### Color Intensity

Blue mascara comes in various shades, from subtle pastels to bold royal blues. Consider whether you want a natural enhancement or a statement look. Keep in mind that blue can sometimes appear green in certain lighting conditions. 

![Blue-Mascara-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Blue-Mascara-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Formula Characteristics

Look for mascaras with a creamy or gel-like texture for intense color payoff. Waterproof formulas are ideal for daily wear, especially if you have active lifestyles or work in environments where sweat or humidity is common. Consider trying both tube and wand styles to see which formula applies most smoothly to your lashes. 


### Volume and Length

Most blue mascaras offer moderate to high volume, as color pigmentation often prevents extreme voluminous formulas. Check if the product specifies "lengthening" or "curling" benefits, as these features can enhance your natural lash shape while applying color. 

![Blue-Mascara-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Blue-Mascara-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Care and Maintenance

Regularly wash your mascara wand to prevent bacteria growth, especially in colored formulas where pigment particles can clog the wand. Consider purchasing separate mascaras for your top and bottom lashes to maintain even color application and prevent tangled lashes during application. 


## FAQ

![Blue-Mascara-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Blue-Mascara-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What colors of blue mascara are available?

Blue mascara comes in various shades, from cool tones like sapphire and navy to warmer possibilities like turquoise and cobalt. Many formulas range from deep, rich blues to soft, pastel hues, depending on the brand and product. 

When selecting a blue mascara shade, consider your skin tone and personal preference. Cool skin tones often look best with cooler blue shades, while warm tones can carry off both cool and warm blue shades. 


### How do blue mascaras compare to traditional black or brown options?

Blue mascara offers a striking contrast to natural eye color, making eyes appear larger and more defined. It's particularly popular for creating dramatic looks but can be challenging to pair with neutral makeup. 

For everyday wear, black or brown mascaras provide more versatility and a safer, natural look. They work well with any eye color and makeup style, while blue mascara requires careful blending and matching. 

![Blue-Mascara-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Blue-Mascara-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the potential drawbacks of using blue mascara?

Blue mascara can be difficult to wear with certain eye colors, particularly green, blue, or hazel eyes, which may look washed out when paired with blue mascara. It's also important to choose the right shade to avoid looking unnatural or harsh. 

The contrast of blue against darker skin tones can be striking but might be overpowering for some looks. Additionally, blue mascara can be challenging to remove completely at the end of the day. 


### Are blue mascaras suitable for all eye shapes?

Blue mascara works well with most eye shapes when applied properly. Curved or hooded eyelids can benefit from the elongating effect of blue mascara, while almond or oval-shaped eyes often look their best with this color. 

Avoid using blue mascara on eye shapes that naturally stand out, as the color can create unflattering emphasis. Always test the product on your own eyes to see how the color looks before committing to a full application. 

![Blue-Mascara-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Blue-Mascara-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How should I apply blue mascara?

Start by applying black or brown mascara to create definition, then gradually layer on blue mascara using synthetic brushes or wands. Begin with light coats and build color gradually to achieve the desired intensity. 

For a natural look, limit blue mascara to the outer two-thirds of your lashes. If you're going for a more dramatic effect, apply it evenly to the root of your lashes, being careful not to overload the product. 


### What maintenance is needed for blue mascara?

Like any mascara, blue mascara needs regular checking for clumping and discoloration. Store it vertically in a cool place and replace it every 3-6 months to prevent bacteria growth. 

If you notice changes in color intensity, separation, or an odd odor, it's time to replace the mascara. Always wash your hands before application and avoid touching the wand to prevent contamination.
