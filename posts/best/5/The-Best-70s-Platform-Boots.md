## Buyer's Guide

70s platform boots represent a versatile footwear trend, combining bold height with vintage style. Understanding the key aspects of these boots will help you choose a pair that matches your style and needs. 


### Height and Rise

The platform height ranges from 1.5 to 5 inches, with the rise (height underfoot) typically comprising 20-60% of the total height. Consider your stride length, as higher rises can create a more dramatic heel position. 


### Cut and Shape

Common styles include Mary Janes, court shoes, and booties. The vamp width affects foot comfort and style expression. For added vintage authenticity, look for details like decorative stitching or metal straps. 


### MATERIALS AND CONSTRUCTION

Polyurethane uppers offer durability and water resistance, while velvet or suede alternatives add texture and warmth. Check the outsole material and grip pattern for walking stability, especially in high-rise styles. 


### MESHER AND CARE

Most 70s platform boots require professional cleaning and preservation. Look for water-resistant coatings and breathable linings to prevent moisture damage. Consider the style's compatibility with your existing footwear collection for versatile styling options. 


## FAQ


### What are 70s platform boots?

70s platform boots are footwear that gained popularity during the 1970s, featuring thick, raised soles that give the wearer added height. These boots combine the comfort of chunky soles with vintage 70s fashion elements. 

Common characteristics include heel heights ranging from 2 to 4 inches, with varying widths and styles. The boots often feature detailed designs such as textured soles, stacked heels, and exaggerated proportions. 


### When were 70s platform boots popular?

The platform shoe trend peaked in the 1970s, particularly during the disco era. Disco boots with high platform soles became a signature piece of 70s fashion. 

After the 1970s, the style experienced several revivals in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, each iteration bringing subtle changes to the design while maintaining the key platform feature. 


### What materials are 70s platform boots typically made from?

Classic 70s platform boots were often constructed from soft leather materials, with some featuring faux fur linings during colder months. Modern interpretations may use synthetic materials or incorporate various textiles. 

Common accessories include decorative overlays of metal studs, glitter, or embroidery, particularly around the heel and upper part of the boot. 


### How should I style 70s platform boots?

For a true 70s revival look, pair these boots with flared pants, bell-bottom jeans, or matching skirt ensembles. Complete the outfit with a structured blazer or a casual button-down shirt. 

For a more contemporary take, try them with tailored trousers, midi dresses, or relaxed turtleneck sweaters. Choose a boot with a thinner heel or a sleeker design for a modern twist on the vintage style. 


### Are 70s platform boots comfortable?

Modern platforms incorporate more supportive features than vintage versions, but height expectations vary. Most boots provide between 2 to 4 inches of lift, which can affect walking and standing posture. 

Choosing a boot with proper arch support and a reinforced heel is crucial for comfort, particularly if you plan to wear them for extended periods. 


### How should I care for 70s platform boots?

Store your boots in a cool, dry place when not in use, and avoid leaving them in direct sunlight or extreme temperature conditions. Consider using shoe trees to maintain their shape. 

Regular cleaning should involve wiping down the boot with a damp cloth and mild soap solution, followed by a dry cloth to prevent moisture buildup and potential damage to the material.
