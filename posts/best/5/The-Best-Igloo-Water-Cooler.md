## Buyer's Guide

Igloo water coolers offer a practical solution for refreshing drinking water, featuring compact designs that fit easily into various environments. When selecting an Igloo water cooler, consider the following key factors to ensure you choose the right model for your needs. 


### Water Capacity and Refill Frequency

The water capacity determines how often you'll need to refill the cooler. Common capacities range from 1 to 5 gallons. Consider your daily water consumption and the convenience of refilling time when choosing a size. Keep in mind that larger capacities may require more storage space. 


### Refrigeration Method

Igloo water coolers use either mechanical or electronic refrigeration. Mechanical coolers are more energy-efficient but may be noisier.

Consider the trade-offs between cost, noise level, and energy consumption for your specific setting.

These coolers come in various shapes and sizes to suit different spaces. Wall-mounted, countertop, and bottle-style options are available. Measure your intended placement area to ensure the chosen model fits both width and depth requirements. Consider the unit's height if it will be mounted on a wall or placed on a shelf.

Look for models with energy-efficient refrigeration, automatic shut-off features, and durable, BPA-free materials. Some advanced models include LED indicators, digital temperature displays, and ergonomic handles. These features enhance usability and reduce environmental impact without significantly increasing costs.

Selecting the right size water cooler depends on your daily water consumption. Igloo recommends considering the number of people using the water and their typical daily consumption.
