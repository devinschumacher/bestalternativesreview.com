## Buyer's Guide

Oil paint has been a staple medium in artistic expression for centuries, prized for its luminous quality and versatility. Understanding the fundamentals of oil paints will help you select the right materials for your painting projects. 


### Types of Oil Paint

Oil paints come in two primary types: tube and cake. Tube paints offer the most variety and consistency, while cake paints (also called pan or cake paints) are convenient for travel and small-scale work. Linseed oil paints are traditional, while alternatives like poppyseed and walnut oil offer specific properties for certain techniques. 


### Color Range and Pigment Quality

The color range can vary significantly between brands. Premium brands like Winsor & Newton and Daniel Smith offer broader palettes with higher pigment concentrations. Consider the specific pigments included; ultramarine blue and cadmium yellow, for example, are both highly prized for their strength and brilliance. 


### Paint Viscosity and Texture

Oil paint viscosity affects its application and drying time. Thinner paints dry faster and work better for glazing techniques, while thicker paints resist blending and work well for impasto. The paint's consistency can also impact the canvas absorption and texture development. 


### Care and Storage

Proper storage extends the life of your oil paints and maintains their quality. Store tubes in a dark, cool place, and keep them upright to prevent air bubbles. Use oil paint hardeners like Butvar B-72 or PVA to extend open-air working time without compromising quality. Regularly clean brushes with mineral spirits and allow them to dry completely between uses. 


## FAQ


### What materials are used to make oil paint?

Oil paint consists of pigment suspended in a drying oil, usually linseed oil. The mixture also contains additives that control consistency and improve pigment suspension. 

Additional ingredients may include extenders (like chalk or silica), driers (such as cobalt or manganese), and humectants to prevent paint from drying out while it's still wet. 


### How long does oil paint take to dry?

Oil paints can take anywhere from a few hours to several days to fully dry, depending on the thickness of the application and environmental conditions. Thinner layers usually dry faster than thicker ones. 

Certain brands of oil paints dry more quickly due to added driers, while slower-drying oils like poppy seed can extend the drying time of the paint. 


### What type of paintbrushes work best with oil paint?

Synthetic brushes with nylon bristles are ideal for oil paints as they hold the thick consistency well and resist degradation from solvents. 

Sable or hog hair brushes offer excellent paint flow and texture control, making them suitable for both detail work and broader brush strokes. 


### How should unused oil paint be stored?

Unused oil paint can be stored in its original container with the lid tightly sealed. The paint should remain in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. 

If you need to transfer the paint to a different container, use one made from non-reactive materials like glass or inert plastic, and keep the lid clean and dry. 


### Can oil paint be mixed with watercolors?

Oil paint and watercolor do not mix properly due to their different chemical compositions. The oil binder in oil paint repels water, making it incompatible with watercolor mediums. 

Watercolor pigments can be ground and mixed with oil medium to create oil-in-water mixtures, but this process requires proper techniques and materials specific to oil painting. 


### What techniques can extend oil paint's usable life?

Covering wet paint with a clear varnish layer helps protect it from dust and contamination while maintaining workability. This technique also prevents the paint from absorbing too much moisture from the air. 

For longer storage, consider using vacuum-sealed containers with desiccant packs to maintain consistent humidity and prevent solvent evaporation.
