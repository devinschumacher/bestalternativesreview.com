### Dirty Dustbin Capacity and Filtration Systems

## FAQ

![Dyson-Robot-Vacuum-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Dyson-Robot-Vacuum-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What makes Dyson's robot vacuum cleaner unique?

Dyson's robot vacuum cleaner combines advanced self-cleaning technology with powerful suction. Unlike traditional robots that just move around the room, these vacuums use Dyson's digital motor technology to clean carpets and hard floors more effectively than most competing models. 

The robots also feature intelligent navigation systems that map your home, optimize cleaning patterns, and return to their charging base when the battery gets low to complete the cleaning cycle. 


### How do Dyson robot vacuums handle different floor types?

These vacuums are designed to handle both carpeted and hard flooring surfaces effectively. They feature adjustable suction power to adapt to different floor types and include brushes that can manage dirt, dust, and small debris from carpeted areas. 

However, they may struggle with very thick carpets or rugs without a dedicated cleaning mode. For stubborn pet hair and deep carpet cleaning, Dyson offers specific models with enhanced carpet cleaning capabilities. 

![Dyson-Robot-Vacuum-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Dyson-Robot-Vacuum-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How smart is Dyson's robot vacuum?

Dyson's robot vacuums include several smart features. They can map your home and plan cleaning routes, return to their charging dock when the battery is low, and avoid obstacles like stairs and furniture. Some models also include smartphone app connectivity for remote control and scheduling. 

They use sensors to detect changes in room size and shape, and can resume cleaning from where they left off if interrupted. However, advanced features like object identification and dynamic obstacle avoidance are still evolving in robot vacuum technology. 


### How often do Dyson robot vacuums need maintenance?

Regular maintenance includes emptying the dust container and cleaning or replacing the filter as needed. The brushes should be checked and cleaned after each use to remove hair and debris. 

Some models need their docking station filters cleaned monthly, while others require motor housing maintenance every six months. Proper care extends the vacuum's effectiveness and extends its lifespan. 

![Dyson-Robot-Vacuum-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Dyson-Robot-Vacuum-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can Dyson robot vacuums handle pet hair?

Dyson's robot vacuums are generally good at collecting pet hair from both carpeted and hard floors. Their digital motor technology helps break free entangled hair and the HEPA filtration system captures fine particles. 

For homes with heavy pet hair, Dyson offers specific models with extended filtration systems and motorized brushes designed to capture more pet hair. Regular emptying of the dust container and cleaning of the filters maintains optimal performance for pet owners. 


### What is the noise level of Dyson robot vacuums?

These vacuums operate at moderate noise levels, typically between 65-75 decibels, which is similar to a normal conversation. Most users find the operating noise to be reasonable during cleaning. 

During charging, the vacuum produces noticeably more sound due to the base unit operating. Some models feature quiet charging mode which reduces sound during charging to about 55 decibels, making it less disruptive.
