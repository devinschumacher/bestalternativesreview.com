The reinforced stitching, water-resistant materials, and sturdy aluminum frames are built to maintain their shape and functionality after dozens of trips. Their bags typically undergo rigorous testing to ensure they meet industry standards for durability and performance.

### How does London Fog compare to other luggage brands?

Their water-resistant polyester construction provides better protection against spills and light rain than many budget-friendly options, while still being more affordable than premium brands like Louis Vuitton or Gucci. 

While their bags lack some of the innovative features found in luxury luggage (like automated packing systems or robotic suitcases), they excel in basic functionality, with reliable zippers, sturdy frames, and generous storage capacities that surpass many less-expensive options on the market. 


### What is the warranty coverage for London Fog luggage?

London Fog luggage typically comes with a limited warranty covering manufacturing defects and workmanship for a period of 5 years. This warranty usually covers the frame, external stitching, and other structural components that maintain the bag's shape and function.
