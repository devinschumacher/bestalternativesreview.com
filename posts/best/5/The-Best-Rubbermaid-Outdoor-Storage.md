## Buyer's Guide

Rubbermaid outdoor storage containers provide a reliable solution for organizing and protecting outdoor items. These durable containers are designed to withstand various weather conditions while keeping your belongings dry and secure. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the right Rubbermaid outdoor storage container for your needs. 


### Material and Construction

The container material determines its durability and weather resistance. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) offers excellent strength and impact resistance. Some models featuring UV protection resist fading and cracking from sunlight. Look for reinforced corners and stress-tested handles to ensure the container can carry its weight. 


### Size and Shape

Measure your storage space before selecting a container size. Common shapes include rectangular, cube, and cylindrical designs, each with advantages. Rectangular containers offer versatile stacking options, while cylindrical models maximize space efficiency. Consider the container's footprint and height to determine if it fits your storage area. 


### Features and Functionality

Essential features include secure closures like snap-tight lids and latches, which prevent water intrusion and keep contents dry. Look for containers with built-in wheels or handles for easy transportation. Some models include drainage holes to prevent water accumulation, while others feature interior dividers for organized storage. Check for interior coatings that resist scratches and chemical damage. 


### Maintenance and Durability

Proper maintenance ensures your container remains in good condition. Always clean containers thoroughly before storage to prevent mold growth. Store containers on a level surface to prevent warping and maintain their shape. Consider the container's warranty period, as longer warranties typically indicate better durability. Regular inspections for cracks or damage help identify issues before they become problematic. 


## FAQ


### What materials are used in Rubbermaid outdoor storage products?

Rubbermaid outdoor storage products are typically made from high-density polyethylene (HDPE), a durable plastic that resists moisture and UV rays. This material is chosen for its strength and longevity when exposed to outdoor elements. 

HDPE provides good impact resistance and doesn't rust or rot like metal or wood alternatives. The storage containers often feature double-wall construction for added durability and are available in various sizes and shapes to suit different storage needs. 


### How do Rubbermaid outdoor storage containers stay secure?

Rubbermaid containers usually feature flip-top lids with snap-lock mechanisms that secure with a tight seal. The lids have grooves that align with the container walls to create a secure closure that prevents leaks and keeps contents dry. 

Some models include latches or hasps for added security, allowing you to attach a padlock (not included) for extra protection against unauthorized access. 


### What are the dimensions and capacities of Rubbermaid outdoor storage containers?

Product dimensions and capacities vary by model, typically ranging from small 3-gallon bins to large 90-gallon models. Common sizes include 5-gallon, 10-gallon, 15-gallon, and 20-gallon containers. 

Each container is clearly marked with its capacity in gallons or liters, and overall dimensions in inches or centimeters. These measurements help users determine the appropriate size for their specific storage needs. 


### Which Rubbermaid outdoor storage model is best for lawn and garden tools?

The Rubbermaid 15-gallon Lawn and Garden Tool Storage Bin is a popular choice. It features a snap-lock lid with reinforced edges, latches for padlock attachment, and double-wall construction for durability. 

For larger tools, consider the Giant 90-gallon Garden Storage Container, which has reinforced lid handles and double-wall construction to support heavy loads. 


### How do Rubbermaid outdoor storage containers stack and nest?

Rubbermaid containers often design their lids to sit snugly on the walls of the next bin down, allowing you to stack multiple containers while maintaining a clean, organized look. The double-wall construction helps prevent damage when stacking. 

Nesting containers typically have slightly smaller dimensions than their larger counterparts, so they fit inside a larger bin for additional storage space. This feature is particularly useful for efficient garage or shed organization. 


### How do I maintain Rubbermaid outdoor storage containers?

To keep your Rubbermaid containers in good condition, simply clean them with soapy water and a plastic brush when needed. The smooth HDPE surface makes it easy to remove dirt and grime. 

For stubborn stains, you can use a mild household cleaner, but avoid harsh chemicals that might damage the plastic. Store containers in a dry place indoors when not in use to protect them from extreme weather conditions.
