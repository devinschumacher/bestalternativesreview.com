## FAQ

![Diamond-Tester-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Diamond-Tester-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a diamond tester?

A diamond tester, also known as a diamond detector or diamond testerscope, is a specialized instrument used to determine whether a gemstone is a genuine diamond or a simulante. These tools work by measuring specific properties of the stone, such as its thermal conductivity and refractive index, which differ between real diamonds and diamonds simulantes. 

The most common types of diamond testers use electric resistance, thermal conductivity, or both to identify diamonds. They are small, portable devices that typically feature a temperature-sensitive probe or a resistance measurement system. 


### How accurate are diamond testers?

Diamond testers are highly accurate when used properly, with most modern devices capable of correctly identifying real diamonds 95-99% of the time. However, they are not foolproof and can have false positives with certain diamond simulants like cubic zirconia or moissanite. 

The reliability of a diamond tester depends on several factors, including the quality of the device, proper calibration, and the skill of the user. Professional-grade testers with multiple detection methods typically provide the most accurate results. 

![Diamond-Tester-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Diamond-Tester-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What properties do diamond testers measure?

Diamond testers primarily measure two key properties: thermal conductivity and electrical resistance. These measurements help determine if a stone has the characteristics of a genuine diamond. 

Some advanced testers also measure the stone's density, specific gravity, or fluorescence patterns, which can further confirm or refute a diamond identification. 


### How do I use a diamond tester?

Most diamond testers have a single-use method where you place the tip of the probe or sensor directly on the stone's surface. For electric resistance testers, you touch the stone with the probe while the device is activated. For thermal conductivity testers, you hold the probe against the stone and wait for it to change temperature. 

After the measurement, the tester will display a pass or fail signal, indicating whether the stone is likely to be a diamond. Some devices may also provide additional information about the stone's characteristics. 

![Diamond-Tester-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Diamond-Tester-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the limitations of diamond testers?

While diamond testers are effective, they cannot definitively identify all diamond simulants. Certain stones, like Moissanite or some synthetic diamonds, can cause false positives. Additionally, heavily fractured or heat-treated diamonds may not produce reliable readings. 

The accuracy also declines with stones that have metal settings, as these can interfere with electrical resistance readings. Testing should always be done on the stone itself, not through setting metals. 


### Who should use a diamond tester?

Diamond testers are most useful for jewelry professionals, collectors, and consumers who need quick, reliable identification of diamonds. They are particularly valuable for assessing loose stones or in situations where certification is unavailable. 

Home users and non-experts should use these tools as a preliminary screening tool rather than a definitive identification method. Professional evaluation through certification services remains the most accurate way to confirm diamond authenticity.
