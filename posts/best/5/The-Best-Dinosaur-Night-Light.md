### Light Output and Glare

Choose a night light with adjustable brightness levels to accommodate different room lighting conditions. Avoid models with harsh, direct lighting that could disturb sleep. Glare-free diffused light is ideal for creating a relaxing sleep environment.

Many dinosaur night lights include sound effects like roaring noises or ambient sounds inspired by prehistoric environments.

However, the storytelling capabilities vary by model. Some products feature simple recordings, while others offer interactive story-telling experiences with multiple sound options. 


### How should I maintain a dinosaur night light?

To maintain your dinosaur night light, regularly check the batteries and replace them when the light becomes dim. Most models require new AA or AAA batteries every 3-6 months, depending on usage. 

Clean the surface of the light gently with a soft cloth to remove dust and fingerprints. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials that could damage the light's surface or projection components.
