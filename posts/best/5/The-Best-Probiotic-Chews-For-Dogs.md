## Buyer's Guide

Probiotic chews can support your dog's digestive health and overall well-being, but choosing the right product requires considering several important factors. Our guide helps you understand what to look for in probiotic chews, so you can make an informed decision for your pet. 


### Key Ingredients

Look for chews that contain quality probiotic strains, such as Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium species. Each strain offers different benefits, so consider your dog's specific needs. The product should clearly list the probiotic strains and their counts (CFU - Colony-Forming Units).

Most dogs can safely consume probiotic chews, but it's important to check with your veterinarian first, especially if your dog has underlying health conditions or is taking medications. 

Some dogs may need specific probiotic strains, so your vet can recommend the right product based on your pet's individual needs.

Probiotic chews typically work over time to establish a healthier gut environment. You may notice improvements in your dog's digestive health within a few days to a week. 

For significant digestive issues, your vet may recommend additional treatments alongside probiotic chews. 


### Can I give my dog too many probiotic chews?

In most cases, giving your dog too many probiotic chews is unlikely to cause harm, as dogs naturally consume bacteria from their environment. However, always follow the recommended serving size. 

High doses of certain probiotic strains can cause digestive upset in some dogs. If you notice any adverse reactions, stop using the product and consult your veterinarian.
