## Buyer's Guide

A quality wine suitcase is essential for protecting your bottle collection during travel or storage. These specialized cases maintain optimal humidity, temperature, and oxygen levels to keep wine in perfect condition. 


### Materials and Construction

Wine cases are typically made from durable materials like plastic, polycarbonate, or high-density foam. Look for reinforced corners and a rigid structure that can resist impacts. Some cases feature double-walled construction for better insulation. 


### Temperature and Humidity Control

Automatic humidity control systems maintain an ideal 70-72% moisture level. Temperature stability is crucial, so seek cases with either passive insulation or active cooling systems. The case's R-value should be at least 2.0 for effective temperature regulation. 


### Security and Protection

Choose a case with multiple locking mechanisms, including combination locks and padlocks. Impact-resistant inner walls prevent damage from movement, while reinforced corners protect against drops and bumps. 


### Size, Weight, and Rolling Design

Standard wine cases range from 18-24 inches in length, with capacities from 3 to 8 bottles. Heavier cases (over 20 pounds) offer better stability but are less convenient to lift. Modern designs include four-wheeled bases and telescoping handles for easier maneuvering.
