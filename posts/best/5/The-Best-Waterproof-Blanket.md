## Buyer's Guide

Waterproof blankets provide essential protection from unexpected weather conditions, whether you're camping, traveling, or just enjoying the outdoors. Understanding their key features will help you choose a blanket that balances water resistance with comfort and durability. 


### Water Resistance Ratings

The most critical factor is a blanket's water resistance rating. Look for a specific measurement in millimeters (mm) indicating how much water pressure the material can withstand before leaking through. Common ratings range from 2,000 to 10,000 mm, with higher numbers offering better protection. 


### Material Construction

Waterproof blankets typically combine a water-repellent outer layer with a breathable, inner layer. Common outer materials include polyester ripstop and nylon. The inner layer should be made from breathable fabrics like polyester or mesh to prevent condensation. 


### Layering Compatibility

These blankets work best when used as an outer layer or mid-layer. Check the weight and thickness - lighter options (less than 1 kg) are more packable but may be thinner. Heavier blankets (1-2 kg) offer better insulation but take up more space. 


### Additional Features

Consider blankets with storage pockets, tie-down loops, or repair kits. Some have shaped designs for specific uses like bike or canoe camping. If you're using it for sleeping, check the dimensions and whether it rolls tightly enough for your backpack. 


## FAQ


### What makes a blanket waterproof?

Waterproof blankets feature a water-resistant outer layer made from materials like nylon, polyester, or PVC. These materials are coated with a protective layer that repels water droplets and light rain, though they may not be fully waterproof for prolonged exposure to heavy rainfall or submersion. 

The inner layer remains breathable to prevent heat buildup, ensuring comfort during outdoor activities or picnics in wet conditions. The effectiveness can vary between manufacturers, so checking specific water-resistance ratings is recommended. 


### How should I care for a waterproof blanket?

Most waterproof blankets require minimal care. Machine wash them on a gentle cycle with mild detergent, avoiding fabric softeners that can damage the water-resistant coating. For drying, hang or air-dry the blanket rather than using a dryer, which can melt the protective coating. 

Before each use, inspect the blanket for any damage to the water-resistant layer. If you notice signs of wear or peeling, consider having it professionally re-waterproofed to maintain its performance. 


### What activities are waterproof blankets suitable for?

These blankets excel in outdoor activities like picnicking, camping, or beach days where you need protection from light rain or dew. They're particularly useful for keeping warm and dry during boating, fishing, or other water-related excursions. 

While they're designed for daytime or short-term use in mild weather, waterproof blankets aren't suitable for overnight camping in wet conditions or extended exposure to heavy rain or snow. 


### How do I choose the right size waterproof blanket?

For single-person use, a blanket measuring 6 to 6.5 feet long and 4 feet wide provides ample coverage. For couples or groups, consider larger sizes: twin (66" x 92") offers generous coverage, while queen (86" x 92") provides room for multiple users or extra warmth. 

Additional dimensions to consider include weight capacity (typically up to 400 pounds) and storage size. Many blankets now offer multiple lengths to accommodate different needs and preferences. 


### What are the main drawbacks of waterproof blankets?

While lightweight and portable, some waterproof blankets lack the thermal insulation of traditional blankets, making them less suitable for extremely cold conditions. The protective coating can also make them bulkier and less compressible than standard blankets. 

The water-resistant coating may wear off over time with regular use, requiring occasional re-waterproofing with specialized products. Additionally, some users find the plastic-like feel less comfortable than traditional fabrics. 


### What's the difference between waterproof and water-resistant blankets?

While both terms refer to weather-resistant blankets, the distinction lies in their permeability to water. Water-resistant blankets prevent water from passing through but may still allow light moisture to penetrate under pressure. Waterproof blankets can fully repel water, though they typically allow for some breathability to prevent condensation buildup. 

The key difference in performance is often noticeable during extended exposure to rain or immersion in water - water-resistant blankets may become saturated, while waterproof ones will remain dry to the touch.
