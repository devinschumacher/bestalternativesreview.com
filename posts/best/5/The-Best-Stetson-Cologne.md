## Buyer's Guide

Stetson Cologne combines rich, aromatic notes with the brand's signature quality craftsmanship. This guide helps you choose the right Stetson Cologne by highlighting key fragrance profiles and presentation options. 


### Core Fragrance Notes

Stetson's most popular colognes feature a blend of woody, aromatic, and citrus elements. Winter Notes combines spruce and sandalwood with bergamot, while Leather Woody pairs leather and tobacco with cedar. For something different, consider the Gardenia blend, which combines floral gardenia with woody base notes. 


### Size and Presentation

Stetson offers their colognes in various sizes, from travel-friendly 1.7oz sprays to generous 4oz and 8oz bottles. The brand's signature black bottle with gold accents is available in both travel and larger bottle sizes. Consider your usage frequency and storage space when choosing a size. 


### Scents and Sillage

Stetson colognes range from light, daytime scents to richer, after-work options. Winter Notes and Leather Woody are suitable for work or evening events, while Gardenia might be better for home or casual outings. Understanding your intended occasion and the longevity of the scent (sillage) will help you choose the right formula. 


### Allergy Considerations

While uncommon, some fragrances can cause skin irritation. Patch test any new Stetson cologne behind your ear or on your wrist before regular use. Common allergens in colognes include synthetic fixatives and alcohol. Opting for a fragrance with fewer additives can reduce the risk of irritation.
