## Buyer's Guide

Redken Extreme Length is a popular hair care line that addresses dry, damaged hair by providing intense moisture and repair properties. Understanding the key aspects of this product category helps in selecting the right treatment for specific hair concerns. 


### Understanding Extreme Length Technology

Redken Extreme Length products contain advanced moisturizing agents and nourishing ingredients that penetrate the hair shaft to repair damage and replenish essential moisture. The technology works by creating a protective layer on the hair cuticle, locking in moisture and preventing further damage from environmental stressors. 


### Key Ingredients to Look For

The most effective Redken Extreme Length treatments contain a blend of nourishing oils, proteins, and humectants. Ingredients like avocado oil, jojoba oil, and Panthenol work synergistically to repair damaged hair, while Keratin and Collagen provide structural support and strength. Avoid products that contain heavy silicones, which can weigh down hair and prevent proper penetration of active ingredients. 


### Application and Treatment Frequency

For best results, apply Redken Extreme Length products after shampooing to fully cleanse the hair. Start with a small amount, working the product through to the ends of the hair and then distributing it to the mid-lengths. For damaged or extremely dry hair, consider using the product twice weekly as a treatment mask, leaving it on for 10-15 minutes before rinsing thoroughly. 


### Combining with Other Hair Care Products

To maximize the effectiveness of Redken Extreme Length treatments, incorporate a balanced hair care routine. Use a sulfate-free shampoo to remove product residue and prevent buildup. Follow up with a deep conditioner containing similar nourishing ingredients to strengthen and repair the hair. Protect your hair from environmental stressors with heat protection and UV filters, and consider using a lightweight hair oil for daily maintenance. 


## FAQ


### Should I use Redken Extreme Length before or after styling?

Redken Extreme Length works best as a final styling product. Apply it to dry hair after styling for best results, focusing on the ends to protect and enhance shine. 

For maximum protection, use before heat styling tools like blow dryers, flat irons, or curling wands. The product helps prevent heat damage while adding shine and manageability. 


### How much product is needed per application?

Use a small amount – about pea-sized – and distribute evenly throughout the lengths and ends of your hair. Work your way up the strands if your hair is very long or thick. 

If your hair is very dry or damaged, you may need to use a bit more, up to a quarter-sized amount. Start with less and build as needed to avoid product buildup. 


### Can it be used on natural or chemically treated hair?

Yes, it's suitable for all hair types, including natural and chemically treated hair. For natural hair, apply a small amount to the ends before styling. For chemically treated hair, use before heat styling to protect against further damage. 

If you have recently processed your hair, wait 24 hours after coloring or bleaching before using this product. Always patch test first to ensure compatibility with your hair type. 


### How long does it last between applications?

The product provides protection and shine for up to 48 hours. You may need to reapply if you wash your hair daily or expose it to harsh environmental elements like saltwater or pollution. 

If you have very fine or oily hair, you may need to reapply after 24 hours. For thicker hair types, one application can last up to 48 hours with regular styling. 


### How should I store the product?

Store it in a cool place away from direct sunlight and heat sources. The optimal storage temperature is between 68°F and 77°F (20°C to 25°C). 

Avoid freezing the product, as it could affect the texture and consistency. Keep the bottle tightly closed when not in use to preserve its quality. 


### Is it suitable for daily use?

Yes, it's designed for regular use as a finishing product. However, if your hair becomes too weighed down or you experience any irritation, reduce usage to every other day. 

For daily use, start with a smaller amount and work your way up. Listen to your hair's needs, as some days may require more product than others based on environmental factors and styling.
