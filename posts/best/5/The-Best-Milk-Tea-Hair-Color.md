### Are milk tea hair colors safe for regular use?

Milk tea hair colors are safe when used according to the product instructions. While they contain natural ingredients like matcha and milk tea extracts, regular use may cause mild scalp irritation or color fading over time. It's advisable to perform a patch test before use and follow up with a conditioner. 

The safety profile of these hair colors falls within the same category as conventional permanent hair dyes, meaning they contain ammonia and peroxide like traditional hair dyes. Always avoid applying to damaged or scalp-diseased areas. 


### How long do milk tea hair colors typically last?

Milk tea hair colors usually last between 4-6 weeks with proper care. However, results may vary based on factors such as hair texture, frequency of shampooing, and sunlight exposure. 

To maintain color, it's recommended to touch up every 4-6 weeks. The color may fade more quickly if you swim frequently or use hair products that contain bleach or peroxide.

### What types of hair are suitable for milk tea hair colors?

Milk tea hair colors work well on all hair types, including fine, thick, and curly hair. They're particularly effective on light bases, as the natural pigmentation tends to sit well on blonde and light brown hair tones. 

Avoid using milk tea hair colors on deeply colored hair (above Level 7 on the hair color spectrum) as the natural pigmentation may not blend as smoothly with pre-existing dye. 


### Do milk tea hair colors contain any natural ingredients?

Sure, milk tea hair colors incorporate natural ingredients such as matcha green tea extract, milk tea blend, and botanical colorants to achieve their distinctive shade. 

These natural components contribute to the color's richness and shine but may affect color intensity and stability compared to synthetic hair color formulas.

### How do milk tea hair colors compare to traditional permanent hair dyes?

Milk tea hair colors are similar to traditional permanent hair dyes in their chemical composition and application process but offer more natural appearance due to their base of organic pigments. 

While they provide comparable lasting power and coverage, milk tea hair colors may be slightly less vibrant and may require slightly different maintenance techniques, including specialized shampoos and conditioners. 


### What should I do if my milk tea hair color doesn't match the packaging shade?

Color results can vary based on individual hair characteristics and current hair color. If the color doesn't match, carefully check your application technique and hair porosity before considering a different shade. 

For future reference, it's recommended to select a shade that's 1-2 levels darker than your natural hair color for the most consistent results.
