## Buyer's Guide

Shortalls women's clothing combines style, comfort, and practicality, offering a range of options for various occasions and preferences. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you find the right shortalls for your needs. 


### Styles and Fit

Shortalls come in various styles, including pencil, A-line, and wrap cuts. Pencil shorts hug the leg with a straight silhouette, while A-line styles flare slightly at the hips. Wrap shorts cinch at the waist and flare slightly at the thighs. Consider your body type and personal style when selecting a cut. 


### Fabric and Construction

The quality of both the fabric and construction significantly impacts how the shorts feel and wear. Look for shorts made from breathable, moisture-wicking materials if you'll be active or in warm weather. The construction should feature well-placed seams for stability and durability. Pay attention to details like reinforced stitching in stress points and elasticized waistbands for a secure fit. 


### Length and Coverage

Short length varies between styles, with traditional lengths measuring just above the knee. If you prefer longer coverage, consider options with an additional inch or two of leg length. Consider the activity level when selecting length - longer shorts offer more coverage but may be warmer for active pursuits. 


### Combining with Tops

The fit and style of your shortalls should complement your top choices. Shorts with a slightly tapered leg can pair well with straight-leg or boyfriend-style tops, while straight-cut shorts work best with fitted tops. Consider how the shorts' hemline interacts with your top - typically, it's most flattering when the hem falls just above the natural waistline. 


## FAQ


### What are shortalls?

Shortalls combine the comfort of shorts with the protection of knee-length coverage. They're ideal for activities like cycling, running, and hiking where you want to stay cool while protecting your knees. 

Unlike traditional long pants, shortalls offer a more streamlined fit with moisture-wicking properties and flexible joints for better range of motion during exercise. 


### What features should I look for in women's shortalls?

Look for moisture-wicking fabrics, anti-bacterial treatments, and quick-drying materials to keep you comfortable during your workout. Padding for impact sports and reflective elements for visibility during early morning or evening runs are also beneficial features. 

Consider the length and cut of the legs - many styles offer compression for muscle support or longer lengths for extra coverage in colder weather. 


### How do I choose the right size?

Measure your natural waist and the fullest part of your hips to compare with the manufacturer's size chart. Most brands recommend ordering your true size, but some may run small, so consider this when purchasing. 

Test the inseam measurement against your preferred leg length, as some styles offer compression that's slightly shorter than traditional pant lengths. 


### What's the difference between women's and unisex shortalls?

Women's shortalls are typically more form-fitting with specific sizing options, while unisex versions often skew towards a looser cut and more generous sizing spectrum. 

Women's styles often include features like gusseted crotch for increased mobility and different padding options for various activities. 


### How do I care for my shortalls?

Machine wash your shortalls in a mesh bag to prevent snagging. Use mild detergent and cold water to preserve the elastic and padding. Avoid bleach and fabric softeners, which can damage the materials. 

Air dry in a mesh bag or lay flat to maintain the shape and prevent stretching. If needed, use a soft cotton towel to blot excess moisture during drying. 


### Can I wear shortalls for everyday use?

While shortalls are designed for active wear, their moisture-wicking and quick-drying properties make them suitable for casual use on mild days. Consider the material and style - thickerpadding or mesh panels may be less appropriate for non-athletic settings. 

For everyday wear, reserve shortalls for warmer weather and pair them with long-sleeved tops and closed-toe shoes.
