## Buyer's Guide

Phone cases that float can be a lifesaver when you drop your device in water, whether you're at the beach, pool, or by the river. These cases combine protection with the ability to retrieve your phone if it slips from your grasp. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you find a case that matches your needs and lifestyle. 


### Water Resistance Standards

Look for cases that meet IP68 water resistance standards, which means they can handle submersion in water for an extended period. Some cases also feature additional waterproofing seals around the lens and charging ports. 


### Floating Mechanism

Most floating phone cases use a foam core that allows them to stay afloat in water. Some cases have a more sophisticated mechanism that can keep your phone afloat even if the display is facing down. The floating feature should engage automatically when the case is submerged. 


### Protection Features

Ensure the case provides comprehensive protection against drops and impacts. The outer shell should be made from durable materials like TPU or engineering plastics. Consider cases with built-in camera protection and extra padding around the corners and edges. 


### Size and Compatibility

The case should be designed specifically for your phone's model and size. Check the case's thickness and measurements to ensure it fits in your pockets and with your phone's case accessories. Some cases offer interchangeable back panels for different accessory combinations. 


## FAQ


### What is a floating phone case?

A floating phone case attaches to the back of your phone like a sticker or protective layer, allowing the phone to float if dropped in water. It's made of materials like silicone, PVC, or TPU that expand when wet, creating enough buoyancy for the phone to stay afloat. 

These cases are typically about 1mm thick and come in various sizes to fit different phone models. They're designed to be applied once and can last for years with proper care, providing peace of mind when using your phone near water. 


### How do floating phone cases work?

When a floating phone case gets wet, its specially formulated material expands due to water absorption. This expansion creates air pockets that increase the case's buoyancy, allowing it to float on water. The expansion occurs within seconds of contact with water and is reversible when the case dries out. 

The structure of a floating phone case is engineered to respond to water presence without any action required from the user. The case remains attached to the phone via strong adhesive, protecting both the phone and the case during the floating process. 


### What makes a good floating phone case?

A quality floating phone case should provide robust water resistance while maintaining the phone's functionality. It should have clear material that doesn't interfere with the camera or display, come with proper application instructions, and offer a secure fit that prevents bubbles or uneven adhesion. 

Additional features like scratch resistance, UV protection, and anti-fog capabilities can enhance the case's effectiveness and durability. The case should also be compatible with both front- and back-facing phone cameras and support wireless charging when applicable. 


### Can you use a regular phone case with a floating case?

Most floating phone cases are designed to work alone, as additional cases or protective covers can interfere with their water response mechanism. Using a regular case with a floating case may prevent the floating function from working correctly and compromise water resistance. 

Users should remove any protective screens, films, or secondary cases before applying a floating phone case. For added protection, consider getting a floating case that includes basic screen protection as part of its construction. 


### How should you care for a floating phone case?

Regular cleaning and maintenance help ensure your floating phone case performs optimally. Use a soft cloth and mild soap solution to wipe the case weekly, avoiding harsh chemicals that might damage the adhesive. Store the case in a cool, dry place when not in use. 

When the case appears damaged or shows signs of water retention issues, it's time to replace it. Unlike a regular phone case, a floating phone case has a limited lifespan due to its water-absorbing properties, typically lasting 2-3 years with proper care. 


### Are floating phone cases safe for all phone models?

Most floating phone cases are compatible with modern smartphone models, including both Android and iOS devices. However, older or larger phones with specific back designs might not fit properly. 

Before purchasing, verify that the case compatibility list includes your exact phone model. If not, check for cases that offer universal sizing or contact the manufacturer for specific fit information.
