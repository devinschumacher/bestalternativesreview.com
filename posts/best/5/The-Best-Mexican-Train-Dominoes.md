## Buyer's Guide

Mexican Train Dominoes offer a blend of strategy and luck in a game that's easy to learn but challenging to master. If you're considering purchasing this classic domino game, here are the key factors to keep in mind. 


### Game Components

The standard Mexican Train Dominoes set includes 126 dominoes, featuring double-sixes and multiple doubles. The game also requires a playing surface, paper and pencil for scoring, and tokens or chips to represent trains. Sets may vary, so check that the components meet your needs. 


### Game Rules

While the basic rules are straightforward, Mexican Train Dominoes have numerous variants. Common rules include train building, scoring systems, and special tile effects. Understanding these variants helps in choosing the right gameplay style.

## FAQ


### What makes Mexican Train Dominoes unique?

Mexican Train Dominoes introduces a strategic variant to the traditional game by adding the Mexican Train rail system, allowing multiple trains to be built simultaneously. This twist increases gameplay complexity and strategic opportunities compared to standard domino games. 

Each player starts with a unique 7-piece hand, including a "train engine" domino, which must be played immediately. The game's objective remains the same - to be the first to play all your dominoes, but the interconnected network of trains adds an extra layer of strategy. 


### What's the standard setup for Mexican Train Dominoes?

Unlike traditional domino games that use a single layout, Mexican Train Dominoes requires players to create multiple train tracks. Each player starts with a 7-domino hand, including their train engine, while the remaining dominoes form the unused boneyard. 

Trains are built by matching ends of dominoes. The Mexican Train track is a central path that runs around the playing area, while individual player trains extend from specific stations marked by their train engines. Players must play matching ends to any open train end. 


### How do you score points in Mexican Train Dominoes?

Players score points for dominoes left in their hands at the end of the game. Each domino in hand scores its pip value. For example, a 5-6 domino scores 11 points. Unused double dominoes count double their pip value, with doubles scoring 20 points. 

The player with the lowest hand score wins the game. In case of a tie, players with double dominoes in hand score zero points, as they have no pip value. 


### What are the basic rules for building trains?

Players must play matching ends to any open train end, whether it's the Mexican Train or an individual player's train. If a player can't make a legal move, they draw from the boneyard until they can play or draw until their hand contains 7 dominoes. 

If a player has no legal move and can't draw from the boneyard, they forfeit their turn. The next player continues play, building their trains as long as they can. When a player plays their last domino, they call out "Mexican Train" and win the round. 


### How does the Mexican Train system affect gameplay?

The central Mexican Train track provides an additional gameplay dimension, as players can play dominoes to either the Mexican Train or their own trains. This system allows players to block opponents while working on multiple fronts. 

Building the Mexican Train requires strategic planning, as it must be open for play at all times. Players often compete to be the first to complete their Mexican Train, as it can serve as a potential play destination when other options are blocked. 


### What size and material options are available?

Mexican Train Domino sets typically feature premium wooden or acrylic dominoes, with high-quality printing of the numeric values. Standard sets include 28 dominoes per player, with 140 dominoes total including the boneyard. 

Sizes range from compact portable sets ideal for travel to larger versions suitable for casual backyard games. Premium sets often include features like weighted dominoes or themed designs, while basic sets focus on core gameplay mechanics.
