## Buyer's Guide

Brother embroidery machines combine affordability with quality, making them popular choices for both hobbyists and small businesses. Understanding your embroidery needs and capabilities will help you select the right machine for your project. 


### Machine Size and Stitch Capacity

Brother machines range from the basic PE700D to the professional PE8000D, each offering different stitch capacities and designs. Smaller machines like the PE700D are suitable for basic embroidery, while larger models can handle complex designs and multiple threads. 


### Software Compatibility

Most Brother machines use their proprietary embroidery software, which can be installed on Windows or Mac computers. Consider whether you need specialized software for design editing or if the basic editing tools provided are sufficient for your needs. 


### Thread Management System

## FAQ


### What are the differences between Brother's embroidery machines?

Brother offers a range of embroidery machines with increasing features and capabilities. The Home Series (e. g. , PE-6420) is ideal for basic home use with 50 designs. The Professional Series (e. g. , PE-9520) adds automated accessories for framing and trimming, with enhanced design capabilities. 

The Performance Series (e. g. , PE-2720) strikes a balance with 149 built-in designs and the ability to expand with memory cards, suitable for both home use and small business. For serious professionals, the top-tier machines offer the largest design capacity and most advanced functionality. 


### How much space does a Brother embroidery machine need?

The basic embroidery machines (like the PE-6420) require minimal space, measuring around 17.6" wide by 18.9" deep by 6.1" tall. The larger machines (such as the PE-9520) need more room, approximately 19.7" wide by 21.6" deep. 

Consider placing the machine on a dedicated work surface with adequate clearance for the frame and materials, especially for the stand-alone (frame-away) models that need extra space for embroidery accessories. 


### What types of materials can I use with Brother machines?

Entry-level machines typically support a variety of lightweight materials like cotton, knits, and leather up to 1/4" thick. Professional models handle heavier and thicker materials, including denim, corduroy, and 3D projects with additional accessories. 

Always refer to the specific machine's capability guide, as some models require additional accessories or techniques for certain materials. It's important to choose a machine that matches your primary material usage. 


### How do I operate the embroidery software?

The software installs with the machine and guides you through setup. Basic models include simple navigation, featuring tools for digitizing, adjusting, and editing designs. Professional models expand these features with advanced editing tools and design management options. 

Follow the on-screen prompts to load designs, adjust settings, and preview your project before stitching. Take your time to familiarize yourself with the basics, as efficient use of the software improves your embroidery results. 


### What accessories are available for Brother machines?

Basic machines include standard accessories like bobbins, needle packs, and maintenance tools. Professional models offer additional features like automatic frame positioning, trimmers, and specialized bobbins for different materials. 

You can purchase accessories individually or as part of an embroidery kit. It's wise to invest in quality accessories, especially for heavier materials or detailed projects, as they can affect machine performance and embroidery quality. 


### How do I maintain my Brother embroidery machine?

Regular maintenance includes cleaning the machine after each use, checking and replacing bobbins, and cleaning the needle threader. For professional use, consider cleaning the needle area weekly and changing lubricants as recommended in the manual. 

Refer to your specific machine's maintenance guide for recommended cleaning schedules and procedures. Proper maintenance extends machine life and ensures consistent embroidery results.
