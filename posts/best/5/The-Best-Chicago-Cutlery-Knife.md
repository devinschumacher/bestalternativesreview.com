## Buyer's Guide

The Chicago Cutlery knife line offers a diverse selection of kitchen blades, each designed for specific culinary tasks. Understanding the key aspects of these knives will help you choose tools that match your cooking needs and style. 


### Blade Materials and Durability

High-quality stainless steel is standard for Chicago Cutlery knives, with some premium models featuring alloy additions like Vanadium and Chrome. These materials resist corrosion and maintain sharpness longer. Check if the blade is full-tang (the blade extends the full length of the handle) for added durability and proper balance. 


### Handle Design and Comfort

The knife's handle should provide secure, comfortable grip under all cooking conditions. Chicago Cutlery uses various grip patterns: rubberized, diamond-patterned, or simple smooth surfaces. Consider the blade shape when selecting a handle style - some handles work best with certain blade profiles (e. g. , Siggwerk vs. Classic). 


### Edge Geometry and Cutting Performance

The bevel angle (e. g. , 16° for Siggwerk, 20° for Classic) affects cutting performance and blade durability. Longer cutting edges (e. g. , 5" vs. 6") offer greater cutting capacity but less maneuverability. Consider your cooking style: longer edges for slicing tasks, shorter for intricate work. 


### Set Content and Collection Potential

Many Chicago Cutlery collections include multiple blade types in a single set, while others offer standalone pieces. Popular sets include Siggwerk, Classic, and Chef's collection. Think about whether you want a complete set or individual pieces to expand your existing collection.

### Are Chicago Cutlery knives dishwasher safe?

Most Chicago Cutlery knives are dishwasher safe, which makes them convenient for everyday use. However, delicate items like certain knives with wooden handles should be hand washed to prevent damage. 

If you're unsure about a specific model, it's best to refer to the manufacturer's guidelines, which typically specify whether the knife can be dishwasher-safe. 


### What's the weight range of Chicago Cutlery knives?

Chicago Cutlery knives fall into a comfortable weight category, typically ranging from 2 to 6 ounces per blade. The lighter models are ideal for precise work, while heavier options provide better balance for cutting through tougher materials. 

Most standard kitchen knives weigh between 4 and 5 ounces, designed to offer good control while minimizing fatigue during extended use. 


### How do I maintain the sharpness of my Chicago Cutlery knife?

To maintain your Chicago Cutlery knife's edge, it's recommended to use a honing steel regularly (at least once a week) and to sharpen the blade every 4-6 months. The exact frequency depends on the knife's use and the material being cut. 

The company recommends using their own sharpening system, but any consistent method will work as long as it's done correctly to maintain the blade's factory angle. 


### What's the best Chicago Cutlery knife for beginners?
