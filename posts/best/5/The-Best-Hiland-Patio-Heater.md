## Buyer's Guide

A quality patio heater can transform your outdoor living space, particularly during those cooler evenings. With numerous options on the market, choosing the right one can be overwhelming. This guide will help you understand the key features to consider when selecting a Hiland patio heater. 


### Heating Capacity

The heating capacity determines how much space the heater can effectively warm. Consider the size of your outdoor area, typically measured in square feet. Look for heaters that provide BTU (British Thermal Units) per square foot coverage. A general rule is 5-10 BTU/sq ft for ambient temperatures down to 40°F (-4°C). 

![Hiland-Patio-Heater-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Hiland-Patio-Heater-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Heater Type

Hiland offers several patio heater types, including natural gas, propane, and electric models. Natural gas and propane heaters are more powerful and efficient but require professional installation. Electric heaters are easier to install and operate, making them suitable for smaller spaces or casual use. 


### Wind Protection

Outdoor heaters in windy areas need robust wind protection. Heaters with adjustable flame patterns or those that project heat downwards are more effective in windy conditions. Some models feature protective grilles that prevent wind from disrupting the heat output. 

![Hiland-Patio-Heater-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Hiland-Patio-Heater-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Safety Features

Safety should be your top priority when selecting a patio heater. Look for models with heat-resistant housings that prevent accidental burns. Automatic shut-off functions in case of tipped-over units provide an extra layer of protection. Heaters with cool-touch exteriors prevent heat transfer to nearby furniture or landscaping. 


## FAQ

![Hiland-Patio-Heater-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Hiland-Patio-Heater-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What makes a Hiland patio heater different from other outdoor heaters?

Hiland patio heaters stand out in the market through their advanced thermal efficiency and durable construction. Unlike traditional heaters, Hiland models reduce energy consumption by up to 40% while maintaining consistent heat output. 

The heaters feature a robust, rust-resistant aluminum frame that can withstand harsh weather conditions year after year. This durability ensures that your investment remains functional and stylish for many seasons to come. 


### How much heat does a typical Hiland patio heater produce?

A standard Hiland patio heater typically provides 25,000 BTUs of heat, which is enough to warm a 150 square foot area effectively. This output makes them suitable for small to medium-sized outdoor spaces such as patios or decks. 

The actual heat coverage may vary based on environmental factors like wind speed and ambient temperature. For larger areas or colder climates, you might need multiple heaters or consider models with higher BTU ratings. 

![Hiland-Patio-Heater-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Hiland-Patio-Heater-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What fuels do Hiland patio heaters use?

Hiland patio heaters are available in both natural gas and propane versions. Natural gas models connect directly to your home's gas line for continuous operation, while propane models use refillable tanks that screw into the heater base. 

Propane tanks come in various sizes, from 20 to 40 gallons, allowing you to choose based on your usage needs and space availability. Natural gas models typically require a professional installation to connect to the gas line safely. 


### How do I properly maintain a Hiland patio heater?

To maintain optimal performance, clean the heater's burner ports and heat exchanger annually. This involves removing the heating element and using compressed air to remove any debris or accumulated soot. 

Check the gas connections or propane hoses for any signs of wear or leaks before each season of use. Replace any damaged hoses and tighten connections securely to prevent gas leaks. 

![Hiland-Patio-Heater-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Hiland-Patio-Heater-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is the typical operating cost for a Hiland patio heater?

The operating cost varies based on fuel type and local energy prices. Using natural gas, a Hiland heater consumes approximately $1.20 per hour, while propane usage costs around $2.50 per hour, assuming both are running at full capacity. 

Factors affecting cost include the number of hours used per day and the number of days you need heat during the season. Proper installation of a natural gas line can significantly reduce ongoing costs compared to using portable propane tanks. 


### Can I install a Hiland patio heater myself?

Installation varies by model. Some natural gas models require professional installation to safely connect to your gas line, especially if your gas system isn't already fitted for outdoor heaters. These installations typically cost between $150 and $300. 

Propane models can often be installed by the homeowner with basic tools and following the manufacturer's instructions. Always read the installation guidelines carefully and ensure the heater is placed on a level surface away from flammable materials.
