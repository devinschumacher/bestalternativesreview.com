## FAQ


### What is included in the Cricut Maker Bundle?

The Cricut Maker Bundle includes the Cricut Maker machine, a 60-foot roll of vinyl material, a cutting mat, and basic crafting supplies. The machine can handle a wide variety of cutting materials, including cardstock, fabric, and magnetic sheeting. 

Additionally, the bundle typically comes with access to Cricut Design Space software and basic design files to help get you started with your crafting projects. 


### What materials work best with the Cricut Maker?

The Cricut Maker can handle both adhesive and non-adhesive materials. Popular choices include vinyl, cardstock, magnetic sheeting, and some types of fabric. The machine can cut through materials up to 4mm thick, though some materials may require specialty blades or settings. 

For best results, it's recommended to use materials specifically sized for Cricut, as the machine cuts on the back edge of the material roll, affecting the usable length. 


### How does the Cricut Maker's software work?

Cricut Maker uses Cricut Design Space software to create designs. The software features a library with thousands of pre-made projects, and you can also upload your own images. Design Space automatically scales and formats designs for the Cricut Maker's capabilities. 

You can draw directly in the software, use templates, or import images for cutting. The software helps ensure your designs are printable and cuts them based on the material you select. 


### What are the maximum and minimum blade sizes?

The Cricut Maker uses Smart Blades, and the largest blade size is 90mm. The smallest blade is 15mm, allowing for precise cuts that can be as small as 100 points in diameter. The machine automatically selects the appropriate blade based on the material being cut. 

Blades need to be changed regularly, especially when cutting thicker or more abrasive materials like metallic foils. The machine's blade change feature can install new blades in under 2 minutes. 


### How much space is needed for the Cricut Maker?

The Cricut Maker has a compact footprint of approximately 15.6 inches wide by 16.5 inches deep by 17.8 inches tall. For storage, it requires about 23 inches of counter space in addition to its basic footprint. 

You'll need at least 60 inches of height clearance above the machine for rolls of material and for handling cut pieces. The machine includes built-in wheels to slide it out of the way when you're not using it. 


### What are the power requirements for the Cricut Maker?

The Cricut Maker operates on standard household power and requires a 120V electrical outlet. It draws a maximum of 90 watts, which is similar to a small lamp. The machine includes a built-in surge protector and comes with a power cord that's about 11 feet long. 

For most users, the machine doesn't need to be plugged into an outlet directly behind it. The power cord allows you to position the machine in the center of your crafting area while keeping the cord out of the way.
