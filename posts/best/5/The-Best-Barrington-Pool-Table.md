## Buyer's Guide

Choosing the right Barrington pool table involves considering several key factors to ensure you select a high-quality, durable piece of furniture that meets your specific needs and preferences. 


### Size and Space Requirements

Barrington tables typically offer generous playing surfaces, so measure your available space carefully before purchasing. Consider not only the table's dimensions but also the necessary clearance around the perimeter for movement and safety. 


### Construction Quality

Invest in a table with solid wood construction for lasting quality. Pay attention to details like edge banding, rail finish, and leg style, as these elements indicate craftsmanship level. The playing surface should be smooth and true, with precise pockets and accurate bank shot angles.
