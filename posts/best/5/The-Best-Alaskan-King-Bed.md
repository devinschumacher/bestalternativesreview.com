## Buyer's Guide

When selecting an Alaskan King bed, it's important to consider several key factors to ensure you choose the right size and style for your needs. The Alaskan King, measuring 76 inches wide by 80 inches long, offers more width than a standard King bed, making it suitable for couples who prefer extra space. 


### Size Considerations

While the standard King bed measures 76 inches wide and 80 inches long, the Alaskan King adds 6 inches to the width, providing more room for movement and potentially accommodate a partner who prefers side-by-side sleep. However, the increased width means the bed will take up more space in your bedroom. 


### Sleeping Arrangements

The additional width of the Alaskan King is particularly beneficial for couples who enjoy sleeping on their sides. It allows for better posture and reduces the chance of nighttime disturbances. The longer length of 80 inches ensures both partners have enough space, though it might be unnecessary for single sleepers. 


### Storage Solutions

Given the increased size, consider how storage will be managed in your bedroom. Look for beds with built-in drawers or storage compartments under the mattress. Additionally, furniture placement becomes crucial as the bed will consume more wall-to-wall and floor-to-floor space. 


### Frame and Material Quality

Investing in a high-quality frame that matches the bed's size is essential for long-term durability. Check for sturdy construction materials like solid wood or robust metal frames. The foundation should distribute weight evenly and prevent sagging, especially with the extra width of the Alaskan King. 


## FAQ


### What makes an Alaskan King bed different from other king beds?

Alaskan King beds are designed with slightly longer dimensions than standard king beds, providing extra length for better sleep quality. The modified dimensions are 76 inches wide by 80 inches long, giving you an additional 4 inches of mattress length. 

This extra length helps accommodate taller sleepers and provides more room for side sleepers to move around comfortably. The 4-inch variance might seem minor, but it can significantly impact your sleep experience. 


### How much more space do I need for an Alaskan King bed versus a standard king?

The primary difference in space requirements is along the length of the bed. You'll need approximately 4 inches more length when measuring from wall to wall. For optimal movement, add this extra length to your available space calculations. 

Width requirements remain the same as standard king beds (76 inches). Ensure your room's dimensions account for the full 80-inch length to prevent cramped sleeping arrangements. 


### Are Alaskan King beds suitable for all mattress types?

Alaskan King beds accommodate all standard mattress types, including box springs, foundation frames, and adjustable bases. The 80-inch length ensures proper support across most mattress varieties. 

For air mattresses and certain specialty beds, verify compatibility with the bed frame's weight capacity and support structure before purchasing. 


### What considerations should I make when choosing an Alaskan King bed frame?

Frame type (wood, metal, or hybrid) should match your mattress type and weight capacity requirements. Consider frames with built-in storage or adjustable height capabilities if you have specific needs. 

Check the frame's weight rating to ensure it matches or exceeds your mattress's weight capacity. The extra length means more stress on the bed frame, so choose a sturdy construction material. 


### How does the 4-inch length extension affect sleep quality?

The additional 4 inches can enhance sleep quality by providing more space for longer legs and larger body types. It allows for better lateral movement during the night and can reduce leg-folding issues common in standard king beds. 

This extra length is particularly beneficial for couples, providing more personal space and less interference between sleepers. It can also help prevent the common issue of feet hanging off the end of the bed. 


### What are the installation requirements for an Alaskan King bed?

Measure your room carefully, considering the additional 4 inches in length when positioning the bed. Clear the space of any obstacles and ensure the floor can support the bed's weight, especially at the legs where the weight is concentrated. 

Check for any protruding objects near the walls that might interfere with the bed's movement when lowering it. The extra length means you'll need slightly more clearance during setup and movement.
