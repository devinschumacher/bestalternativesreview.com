### Double F Logo and Embellishments

Authentic Fendi heels display the double F logo prominently. The stitching should be straight and even, with no loose threads. Check for any missing or improperly placed embellishments, which may indicate a fake or altered pair. 


### Value and Authenticity

Research the current market value for your desired style and size. Authentic Fendi heels retain their value well, while counterfeit pairs may depreciate. Look for official Fendi retail tags and receipts if purchasing new, or check for authentication services if buying pre-owned.

The price range for Fendi heels spans significantly, from several hundred to several thousand euros. Most styles fall between €500 and €1,500, though signature designs and those featuring exclusive materials can exceed €2,000.

Specialty styles include handbag-inspired boots and customized options like the FF-logoed pumps and oversized-heel designs. 


### How should Fendi heels be taken care of?

Regular maintenance includes using a soft brush to remove dust and storing shoes in their original box with acid-free tissue paper. Avoid contact with water, chemicals, and extreme temperatures. 

Professional cleaning is recommended for special occasions, and treating the leather with nourishing products every 6-12 months can extend the lifespan of the footwear. 


### Can Fendi heels be resized?

Custom sizing options are available through Fendi's official retail partners, though this service requires advance booking and may incur additional charges. Most standard sizes can still be purchased with the expectation that they will fit properly. 

Customers are encouraged to visit an Fendi boutique for personalized fitting advice, as some styles may vary in their true-to-size measurements. 


### How long do Fendi heels typically last?

With proper care, Fendi heels typically last 2-3 years with regular wear, depending on the material and style. Leather and suede models generally maintain their condition longer than rubber-soled styles. 

Customers who take excellent care of their Fendi footwear and follow the brand's maintenance recommendations can expect their heels to remain in excellent condition for several years.
