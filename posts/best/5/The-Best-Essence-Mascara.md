## Buyer's Guide

Mascaras enhance eye makeup by lengthening, thickening, and volumizing eyelashes. The best essences combine volume-building ingredients with conditioning properties for healthy-looking lashes. 


### Key Ingredients

Look for formulas containing natural volume boosters like caviar extract, biotin, or hydrolyzed keratin. These ingredients promote lash growth and strength while conditioning the lash fibers. The base should include nourishing elements such as jojoba oil, argan oil, or vitamins E and F for healthy lash maintenance. 

![Essence-Mascara-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Essence-Mascara-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Volume vs. Length

Different mascaras excel at building volume versus extending lash length. Volume-focused formulas create fuller-looking lashes through clump-resistant formulas and intense color pigmentation. Lengthening mascaras use curl-defining ingredients to dramatically increase lash length while maintaining separation. 


### Application Tips

Apply mascara in thin, even layers rather than building up color in one quick swipe. Start at the root and work outward, separating lashes as you go for natural-looking volume. Consider using a lash primer before application to help the mascara adhere and create longer-lasting results. 

![Essence-Mascara-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Essence-Mascara-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Care and Maintenance

Proper maintenance extends the lifespan of your mascara and maintains hygiene. Store the wand upright in a cool place to prevent bacterial growth. Replace mascara every 3-6 months or sooner if it develops clumps, changes texture, or develops an odd smell. For contact lens wearers, use a specific lens-safe mascara to prevent tear film contamination.
