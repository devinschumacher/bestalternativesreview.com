## Buyer's Guide

The right As Roma jersey can showcase your fandom while keeping you comfortable during games and parades. Here's what to consider when choosing your perfect fit. 


### Size and Fit

Standard sizes run true to Italian measurements, though some newer designs may vary. Men's sizes typically range from 36 to 50, with women's sizes from 34 to 48. Opt for your usual shirt size or slightly larger for a looser fit that allows for layering. 


### Material Quality

Premium polyester or blend materials wick away moisture and maintain shape after washing. Higher-quality jerseys resist shrinking and maintain their colors through multiple washes. Consider the thickness based on your preference and the climate where you'll wear it. 


### Details and Graphics

Look for sharp embroidery or printing that doesn't fade after a few washes. Check that the logos and numbers are securely sewn in place. The interlocking chest panel and zippered closure should smoothly align without bunching. 


### Comfort Features

Choose a jersey with moisture-wicking properties for game days and breathable materials for cheering from the stands. The sleeves should fit snugly without restriction, while the neckline can be V-neck, round, or crew style based on your preference. 


## FAQ


### What makes the As Roma jersey unique?

The As Roma jersey combines classic design elements with innovative performance features. The lightweight, moisture-wicking fabric keeps you dry during matches, while strategic ventilation panels enhance breathability. 

The traditional red and yellow colors remain untouched, with the latest design incorporating updated graphics and enhanced detail work to pay homage to Roma's history. 


### Who designs As Roma's uniforms?

As Roma collaborates with top football uniform manufacturers to design and produce their jerseys. The specific designer can vary by year and kit, but they work with experienced designers who specialize in professional football gear. 

The design process usually involves input from the club's style committee, ensuring the final product aligns with Roma's identity while incorporating modern football fashion trends. 


### How can I choose the right size?

Refer to the official As Roma sizing chart available on their website. Measure your chest, waist, and hips to find your ideal fitting size. Consider whether you prefer a loose or fitted cut, as different manufacturers can have varying standards. 

Try on the jersey if possible, comparing it to similar garments you own to ensure proper fit. If purchasing online, look for detailed measurements and size recommendations in the product description. 


### What materials are used in As Roma jerseys?

High-quality polyester blends are standard, providing a balance of durability and performance. The primary material is usually moisture-wicking, breathable, and fast-drying to keep you comfortable during games. 

Additional materials like reinforced stitching and anti-pilling treatments enhance lasting quality, though specific compositions can vary between manufacturers and seasons. 


### How should I care for my As Roma jersey?

Machine wash the jersey on a gentle cycle with cold water, using mild detergent to prevent damage. Avoid bleach or harsh detergents that can harm the fabric. For drying, hang the jersey to prevent shrinking and maintain its shape. 

Avoid using fabric softeners, as they can affect the material's moisture-wicking properties. Store the jersey in a breathable garment bag or hang it properly to prevent wrinkles and maintain its appearance. 


### Are these jerseys streetwear-friendly?

While the design draws from streetwear influences, As Roma jerseys are primarily designed for athletic performance. The fitted cut and moisture-wicking materials work best when worn during or immediately after physical activity. 

That said, the classic design makes them suitable for casual wear, particularly in cooler weather. Layering options allow wearing the jersey as a mid-layer with casual outerwear for street or social occasions.
