## FAQ


### What makes Amika The Wizard's technology unique compared to other waterless shampoo products?

Amika The Wizard's technology utilizes a proprietary blend of natural ingredients and scalp-fortifying antioxidants to deliver deep cleanse and nourishment without water. Unlike traditional waterless shampoos, which rely solely on surfactants, The Wizard's formula includes ingredients like biotin and keratin to strengthen hair from the scalp up. 

The product's innovative formula works through a two-step process: the first spray activates the ingredients, while the second lock-in moisture and protect the scalp against environmental stressors. This dual-action approach provides superior cleaning power while maintaining hair's natural moisture balance. 


### Are the ingredients safe for all hair types, including sensitive scalps and fine hair?

Amika The Wizard's natural formula is suitable for most hair types, including sensitive scalps and fine hair. The product avoids harsh chemicals and instead uses gentle, nourishing ingredients like chamomile and aloe vera to soothe and protect the scalp.
