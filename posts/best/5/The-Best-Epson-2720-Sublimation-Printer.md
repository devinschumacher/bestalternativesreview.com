## Buyer's Guide

The Epson 2720 sublimation printer offers impressive capabilities for transferring images onto various materials through heat-based processes. Understanding its key features and requirements will help you make an informed choice. 


### Print Resolution and Image Quality

The print resolution determines how detailed and sharp your images will appear. Look for a printer that offers at least 4800 x 1200 dpi (dots per inch) for optimal sublimation results. Higher resolution prints can capture finer details in your designs. 


### Color Management and Gamut

Sublimation prints require accurate color reproduction. Check if the printer supports wide color gamut modes and has calibrated color profiles. These features ensure that your prints match the intended design colors. 


### Print Speed and Efficiency

For regular use, print speed becomes important. The 2720 handles about 13 pages per minute in color, which is decent for home or small business applications. Consider whether this speed meets your workload requirements. 


### Compatibility and Operating Requirements

The printer works with Windows and macOS, making it accessible across popular platforms. Ensure your computer meets the basic requirements for stable operation. Additionally, check the paper handling capacity and feed options that suit your printing needs. 


## FAQ


### What is a sublimation printer, and how does the Epson 2720 differ from other printers?

The Epson 2720 is a dedicated sublimation printer that produces high-quality, durable prints through a heat transfer process. Unlike standard inkjet printers, it uses special sublimation ink that fuses permanently with the material's surface when heat is applied. 

The Epson 2720 stands out in the sublimation printer category with its 12-shear piezo printhead technology, which offers better print resolution and longevity compared to many competitors in its class. 


### What types of materials can the Epson 2720 print on?

The printer supports a wide range of sublimation materials, including polyester-based fabrics, plastic, metal, and ceramic surfaces. It's particularly effective with transfer paper and heat-resistant fabrics designed for sublimation printing. 

Note that while the printer can print on these materials, the final results depend on proper material selection and heat application techniques. 


### What maintenance is required for the Epson 2720?

The printer requires regular maintenance for optimal performance, including cleaning the maintenance cartridge monthly and servicing the printhead every three months. Proper ink management and consistent use of recommended cleaning solutions help maintain print quality and extend printhead life. 

Users should also clean dust filters regularly and replace ink cartridges according to the manufacturer's guidelines to prevent clogs and ensure consistent color reproduction. 


### How long does it take to print with the Epson 2720?

Print times vary depending on the image size and resolution. Standard printing tasks typically take between 2 to 5 minutes per image, with larger or higher-resolution prints taking longer. 

Users should plan their workflow considering both print time and subsequent heat transfer processing, as prints need time to cool and fully settle before handling. 


### What software is needed for the Epson 2720?

The printer requires installation of the Epson Printing Solution software to enable basic printing functions. For advanced features like borderless printing or color management, users need to install additional software components. 

Note that while the printer is compatible with Windows and Mac operating systems, specific software versions may be required for optimal performance on each system. 


### Are there any compatibility issues with third-party ink?

The Epson 2720 is designed for original Epson inks and may not function correctly with third-party alternatives. Using non-Epson cartridges can lead to print quality issues, clogging, and reduced printhead life. 

Users should only purchase officially licensed Epson cartridges to ensure reliable performance and warranty coverage for their printer.
