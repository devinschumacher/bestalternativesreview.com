## Buyer's Guide

Compost worms are essential for vermicomposting, transforming kitchen scraps into nutrient-rich fertilizer. When selecting compost worms, consider several key factors to ensure successful decomposition and worm colony health. 


### Worm Species Selection

Red wigglers (Eisenia fetida) are the most common composting worm species. They thrive in controlled environments and can process large quantities of organic material efficiently. Other species like European nightcrawlers (Eisenia hortensis) have similar characteristics but may be less tolerant of varying conditions. 


### Size and Quantity

Worms come in different sizes, with juveniles being the most active decomposers but slower to mature. A general rule is to start with 1,000 worms per square foot of composting surface, adjusting based on your organic input volume and decomposition rate goals. 


### Health and Quality

Healthy worms should have active movement, moist skin, and no signs of damage or disease. Avoid worms with black spots, unusual odor, or lethargic behavior. Purchasing from reputable suppliers ensures better quality control and customer support. 


### Acclimation and Care Requirements

Worms are sensitive to extreme temperatures and light. Optimal conditions range from 55°F to 77°F (13°C to 25°C) with moderate humidity. Allow new worms to acclimate to their environment for 7-10 days before introducing food waste to minimize stress and improve survival rates. 


## FAQ


### What types of worms are commonly used for composting?

Red wigglers (Eisenia fetida) are the most popular composting worms due to their fast reproduction rate and appetite for organic matter. They can process their body weight in food daily. 

Other suitable species include nightcrawlers (Eisenia hortensis) and tiger worms (Dendrobaena veneta), which also thrive in composting environments. 


### How many worms do I need for my compost bin?

Starting with 1,000 worms can handle kitchen scraps from one person per week. The number can increase as the worm population grows naturally, typically doubling every 2-3 months under ideal conditions. 

For larger compost bins or commercial operations, use 1-2 worms per square foot of surface area. 


### What do compost worms eat?

Worms consume fruit and vegetable scraps, coffee grounds, eggshells, and other organic kitchen waste. They prefer moist, shredded materials to aid digestion. 

Avoid meat, dairy, and oily foods, as these can attract pests and produce odors. Also, steer clear of pet waste and diseased plants. 


### How long does it take to see results?

Within 3-6 months, you should notice a significant reduction in kitchen scraps as the worms process organic matter. Mature compost typically takes 3-8 weeks after moving out of the worm bin. 

Signs of healthy compost include dark color, earthy smell, and small, nutrient-rich particles. 


### How often should I harvest worm castings?

Harvesting can occur every 3-6 months when the bin is full of mature compost. This process involves removing the top layer of material and harvesting the nutrient-rich castings underneath. 

Always maintain at least 1/3 active bedding material in the bin to support ongoing worm activity. 


### What should I do with excess worms?

If your worm population exceeds your compost bin capacity, consider expanding your setup or building additional bins. You can also donate excess worms to local schools, community gardens, or fellow worm enthusiasts. 

For sustainable worm management, regularly monitor population growth and adjust input quantities accordingly to maintain a balanced system.
