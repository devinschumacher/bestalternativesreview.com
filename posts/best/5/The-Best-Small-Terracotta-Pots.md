### What are the benefits of using small terracotta pots?

Small terracotta pots offer excellent drainage, allowing excess water to escape while keeping the roots healthy. The porous nature of terracotta helps retain moisture, making these pots ideal for plants that thrive in slightly drier conditions. 

The natural clay material also has beneficial properties for plant growth. Tiny air holes in terracotta pots facilitate better oxygen circulation around the roots, promoting healthier plant development. 


### What types of plants are suitable for small terracotta pots?

Small terracotta pots work well for plants that don't require deep containers. This includes succulents, small indoor plants like ferns or pothos, and herbs such as parsley or mint. 

Avoid using these pots for plants with extensive root systems that need deeper containers, like tomatoes or large shrubs, as the smaller pot size can restrict growth.

### Can I move small terracotta pots outside?

Yes, terracotta pots are suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. Place them in a well-draining location outdoors and rotate them occasionally to ensure even exposure to sunlight.

### Can I reuse small terracotta pots?

Yes, terracotta pots are durable and can be reused multiple times. However, they may develop cracks over time with repeated use. 

Check for cracks and chips before each use. If you notice significant damage, it's best to replace the pot to prevent soil leakage or plant damage.
