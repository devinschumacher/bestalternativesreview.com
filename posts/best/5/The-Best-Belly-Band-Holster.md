## Buyer's Guide

A belly band holster provides secure, concealed carry for handguns, attaching to the waistband of your pants. The holster houses the firearm between your body and your pants, offering a balance between concealment and accessibility. 


### Size and Fit

Measure your waist and hip circumference to find a holster that fits comfortably. The holster should sit low on your waistband for best concealment. Consider the width of your grip - slim holsters work well with shorter guns, while wider holsters accommodate larger pistols. 


### Materials and Construction

Look for holsters made from durable, moisture-resistant materials like Kydex or Cordura. These materials maintain their shape and prevent holster wear. The retention clip should securely hold the gun in place while allowing quick draw. 


### Retention Level

Select a holster with appropriate retention based on your firearm and carry requirements. Daily carry options typically use two clips for secure retention, while concealed carry often opts for one clip for faster draw. Consider if you need thumb retention straps for better grip control. 


### Comfort Features

Elongated D-rings distribute pressure away from your hip bone. The belt clip should rotate independently to keep the holster vertical regardless of your stance. Backing pads between the holster and pants reduce irritation from the metal clip. 


## FAQ


### What is a belly band holster?

A belly band holster is a type of belt-mounted holster that attaches to the waistband of clothing, typically worn under clothing. It consists of a holster and a belt clip that keeps it securely in place. 

The design allows for quick draw accessibility while keeping the firearm concealed under clothing, making it popular for everyday carry. 


### How do I wear a belly band holster?

Wear your standard belt as you normally would. Attach the holster to the belt clip, positioning it just below the belly button for most comfortable concealment. 

Slide your firearm into the holster as you would with any other holster, making sure the retention clip is engaged. 


### What firearms are compatible with belly band holsters?

Most standard-size pistols with double-stack magazines will fit in a belly band holster, including Glock, Smith & Wesson, and Springfield Armory models. 

Compact and subcompact models tend to work best, while larger, full-size pistols may not fit properly due to size limitations. 


### How secure is a belly band holster?

The retention clip keeps the firearm secure and in place during daily activities. However, it's important to maintain proper retention and not to overload the holster with additional accessories. 

While highly concealable, regular practice is necessary to develop quick draw skills. The holster should be worn with compatible clothing to prevent show-through. 


### What kind of clothing works best with belly band holsters?

Most pants with a flat waistband work well, including jeans, khakis, and dress slacks. The holster should sit flush against the body to maintain concealment. 

Avoid wearing thick, bulky fabrics that might interfere with the retention clip or show through the clothing. 


### How do I clean and maintain a belly band holster?

Use a soft cloth and mild soap to clean the holster, avoiding harsh chemicals that might damage the surface. 

Check the retention clip regularly to ensure it's functioning properly. Allow the holster to air dry completely before storing it.
