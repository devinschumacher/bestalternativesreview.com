### Active Ingredients

### Skin Compatibility

While most lume soaps are suitable for all skin types, it's crucial to test new products before extensive use.

Reading ingredient lists carefully helps ensure compatibility.

![Lume-Soap-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Lume-Soap-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How Long Do Lume Soaps Last?

A standard Lume Soap bar lasts approximately 4-6 weeks of regular use, depending on the frequency and duration of each wash. The dense, moisture-retaining formula helps the soap maintain its shape and consistency. 

To extend the life of your soap, store it in a well-ventilated area or soap dish that allows air circulation. Avoid placing it in a sealed container or in waterlogged conditions, which can accelerate melting and deterioration. 


### Can Lume Soaps Be Used for All Skin Types?

Most Lume Soaps are suitable for regular use across various skin types, from dry to oily. The mildly acidic pH level of 5.5 to 6.0 makes them gentle on most skin conditions, including sensitive skin when fragrance-free options are available. 

If you have specific skin concerns or sensitivities, consider trying smaller bar sizes or sampling different scents to find the perfect match. Lume offers hypoallergenic variants that exclude potential irritants like artificial colors and harsh detergents.
