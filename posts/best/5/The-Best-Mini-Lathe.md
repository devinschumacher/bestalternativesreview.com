Crafted from robust iron with precision tapered roller bearings, this mini metal lathe delivers impressive accuracy within 0.01mm. The powerful 750W DC motor and infinitely variable speeds from 50-2500 RPM handle everything from delicate modeling work to precision part processing. The included 3/4-jaw chuck and professional compound rest make quick work of internal cutting and beveling tasks. 


## Buyer's Guide

A mini lathe is a compact metalworking machine that enables precise turning and shaping of round stock. This versatile tool is suitable for hobbyists, small workshops, and prototyping applications. When selecting a mini lathe, several key factors influence its performance and suitability for your projects. 


### Technical Specifications

Primary considerations include the lathe's maximum RPM (revolutions per minute) for surface finish and material removal rates, as well as its maximum supported workpiece diameter and length. The drive system's stability and the rigidity of the machine base affect its ability to maintain accurate dimensions during machining.

### Power and Control

Mini lathes typically operate on household electricity and can be powered by single-phase or three-phase supplies, depending on the model. Digital control systems offer improved spindle speed and feed rate accuracy compared to manual controls, while geared transmissions provide better torque for heavier cutting operations. 


### Workholding and Accessories

A reliable tailstock and robust chuck system are essential for secure workpiece clamping. The chuck size and type (three-jaw, four-jaw) determine the range of workpieces you can machine. Additional accessories like a steady rest, cutting tools, and cutting fluid holder expand the lathe's functionality.

### Space and Setup Requirements

Mini lathes vary in footprint, from compact floor-standing models to tabletop variants. Consider the available workspace and the machine's stability requirements, especially for heavier cutting operations. The electrical setup needs attention to power consumption and proper wiring for safety. 


## FAQ

### What is a mini lathe, and how is it different from a full-size lathe?

A mini lathe is a smaller, more portable version of a traditional lathe. While full-size lathes are typically found in manufacturing shops, mini lathes are designed for hobbyists and small-scale projects. They're smaller, lighter, and often more affordable. 

Mini lathes offer similar functionality to their full-size counterparts, but with reduced size and capacity. They're ideal for shaping metal and plastic materials into precise cylindrical forms. 


### What materials can a mini lathe work with?

Mini lathes can handle a variety of materials, including metal (aluminum, brass, steel), plastic, and some types of wood. However, the specific materials and workpiece sizes are limited by the machine's capacity. 

The cutting tools and clamping mechanisms may need adjustment for different materials, so it's important to refer to the machine's specifications and user manual.

### How does the workpiece size affect mini lathe performance?

Mini lathes typically have limited travel and cutting capacity, so workpieces must be proportionally smaller than those processed on full-size machines. Most can handle pieces between 1.5 and 4 inches diameter, though this varies by model. 

Smaller workpieces often allow for more precise control and visibility, making them ideal for detailed work and small batches. 


### What safety considerations are important when operating a mini lathe?

Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment, including safety glasses, dust mask, and work gloves. Ensure the machine is properly grounded and regularly maintain all safety guards and emergency stops. 

Keep your workspace clean and clutter-free, and never reach over moving parts. Unplug the machine when changing tools or making adjustments.

### How much space is needed for a mini lathe?

A mini lathe requires minimal space compared to full-size machines, typically needing only a 2x2 foot work area. Many models can be placed on a workbench or dedicated stand. 

Consider additional storage space for tools, materials, and workpieces. Allow extra space for setup and cleanup, especially when working with different materials. 


### What maintenance requirements should I expect for a mini lathe?

Regular maintenance includes cleaning the machine after each use, checking and adjusting coolant systems, and inspecting tools and cutting edges. A thorough cleaning and lubrication schedule should be established based on usage frequency. 

Check for worn parts, replace cutting tools when necessary, and inspect the machine's electrical components. Following the manufacturer's maintenance guide ensures optimal performance and longevity.
