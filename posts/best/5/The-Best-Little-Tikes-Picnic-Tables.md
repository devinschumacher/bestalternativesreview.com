### What materials are these picnic tables made from?

The tables are primarily constructed from high-quality plastic, which provides excellent durability and resistance to weather elements. The plastic material is impact-resistant and easy to clean, making it ideal for outdoor play areas. 

Some premium models feature metal components or mixed-material designs, combining strength with the plastic's weather-resistant properties to create more robust play structures.

### How much weight can these picnic tables support?

The weight capacity varies by model, ranging from 50 to 150 pounds. This capacity is sufficient for supporting children comfortably while playing or using the table for light activities like drawing or storytelling. 

For families with multiple children or planning group play sessions, it's important to choose a model with higher weight capacity to ensure safety and durability. The weight rating is always clearly stated in the product specifications. 


### How should these picnic tables be maintained?

Regular maintenance is minimal due to the plastic construction, which prevents warping, cracking, or rusting. Simple cleaning with a mild soap solution and water keeps the table looking its best. 

After each use, especially during rainy weather, it's a good practice to check for any loose screws or accessories and to clean any areas that may have accumulated debris. This basic care helps maintain the table's longevity and appearance.
