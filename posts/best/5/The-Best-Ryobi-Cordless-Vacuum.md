## Buyer's Guide

Ryobi cordless vacuums combine convenience with portability, making them a practical choice for various cleaning tasks. Understanding their key features and capabilities will help you select the right model for your needs. 


### Power Source and Battery Life

Ryobi cordless vacuums run on high-capacity Lithium-ion batteries that offer longer runtime compared to older NiCd technology. Look for vacuums with multiple battery options for different cleaning scenarios. The runtime should match your cleaning requirements, ranging from 20-40 minutes per charge, depending on the model and usage. 


### Vacuum Technology and Filtration

Modern Ryobi vacuums use advanced filtration systems, including HEPA technology, to capture fine particles. The suction power should be adjustable for various cleaning tasks. Some models incorporate brushless motors for increased efficiency and longevity. 


### Storage and Accessories

Consider vacuums with modular designs that allow quick accessory changes. Essential accessories include crevice tools, dusting brushes, and motorized brushes for different cleaning needs. The storage needs to protect these accessories while keeping the vacuum compact for transport. 


### Budget and Warranty

Ryobi vacuums range from budget-friendly options to premium models with advanced features. Higher-priced models often offer better suction power, filtration, and battery capacity. Check the warranty coverage, with at least one year of protection recommended for a reliable purchase. 


## FAQ


### What is the runtime of Ryobi cordless vacuum batteries?

Ryobi cordless vacuums typically offer runtime between 15 to 45 minutes per charge, depending on the model and settings used. Deeper cleaning modes and simultaneous dust collection can reduce runtime, while lighter modes and less dust collection can extend it. 

Battery performance also varies based on the type (NiMH or Li-ion) and the vac's specific power requirements. Recharge time generally ranges from 2 to 6 hours, with premium models offering faster charging capabilities. 


### Are Ryobi vacuums compatible with standard vac bags?

Most Ryobi vacuums use proprietary bags that are specifically designed for their system. While some third-party bag alternatives exist, they may not provide the same performance or compatibility as original Ryobi bags. 

For dust collection, some models offer filter systems instead of bags, which require different maintenance and replacement schedules. Always check the manufacturer's guidelines for compatible components. 


### How do I maintain the battery performance?

To maintain battery performance, store batteries fully charged and in a cool, dry place to prevent degradation. Avoid completely discharging the battery before recharging and do not leave it fully charged for extended periods. 

Follow proper charging procedures: use the original charger if available, and ensure the battery is clean and free from physical damage before each use. Regularly inspect the charging port for debris that could affect performance. 


### What accessories come with a basic Ryobi vacuum?

Most basic Ryobi vacuums include a crevice tool and dusting brush as standard accessories. More comprehensive kits may also include motorized heads, dual-purpose attachments, and various brush rolls for different cleaning needs. 

Some models offer additional features like power adjustment settings, LCD displays, or extra batteries for extended cleaning sessions. Check the specific product page for included accessories. 


### Can I use a Ryobi vacuum wet?

Ryobi vacuums are generally designed for dry cleaning and may damage internal components if used with liquids. Using water can lead to electrical shorts, reduced performance, and premature failure of the vacuum. 

If you need to clean wet messes, consider using a bucket and mop or a dedicated wet-dry vacuum that is designed for liquid cleaning. For light spills, a microfiber cloth and appropriate cleaner may be sufficient. 


### What is the warranty coverage for Ryobi vacuums?

Ryobi vacuums typically come with a warranty that covers defects in materials and workmanship for 1-2 years, depending on the model. Some premium models offer extended warranties for an additional fee. 

Warranties usually cover parts but not labor costs for repairs. For complete coverage, check the specific warranty terms provided with your purchase and keep your receipt for proof of purchase.
