## Buyer's Guide

Corner planters offer a creative solution for vertical gardening, particularly in spaces where floor area is limited. These planters maximize usable space by utilizing walls, making them ideal for balconies, patios, or indoor corners. When selecting a corner planter, consider factors such as material durability, drainage options, and plant compatibility to ensure optimal growth and aesthetics. 


### Material Durability

Corrugated plastic and metal planters may rust or warp over time, while wood options can rot if exposed to excessive moisture. Opt for planters made from weather-resistant materials like treated pine, bamboo, or quality plastics designed for outdoor use. These materials resist decay and maintain their shape through seasonal changes. 


### Drainage Options

Excess water can lead to root rot and soil erosion, so proper drainage is crucial. Look for planters with built-in drainage holes or models that allow forinsertion of drainage trays. If the planter lacks holes, consider using a layer of small stones at the bottom followed by a layer of activated charcoal to prevent odor and improve airflow. 


### Plant Compatibility

Certain plants thrive in specific environmental conditions. Most corner planters maintain consistent humidity and sunlight patterns, making them suitable for a wide range of indoor and outdoor plants. However, some species prefer lower light levels or more frequent watering than what a corner planter can provide. Research your plant's needs and select a planter size and material that matches these requirements. 


### Maintenance Considerations

Regular maintenance ensures your corner planter remains both functional and attractive. This includes cleaning the planter's exterior annually, checking drainage systems for blockages, and monitoring plant health for any signs of stress. Consider the frequency of required maintenance when selecting a planter, as more complex designs may require more attentive care. 


## FAQ


### What is a corner planter?

A corner planter is a type of garden container designed specifically for placement in corners. These planters maximize space by utilizing the nooks and crannies of rooms or patios where traditional planters wouldn't fit. 

Available in various materials like wood, metal, and plastic, they come in both freestanding and wall-mounted designs. Some models feature built-in water collection systems, while others include self-watering mechanisms to keep plants healthy between waterings. 


### How do I measure for the right corner planter?

Measure the corner where you plan to place the planter, noting both the width and height. The combined dimensions should be less than the available space in your chosen location. 

Check if the corner is a 90-degree or 120-degree angle, as this will determine the shape of the planter that will fit best. Consider the distance between the walls, ensuring there's enough room for proper plant growth and maintenance. 


### What plants work well in corner planters?

Most herbs, small flowering plants, and air-purifying plants thrive in corner planters. Popular choices include succulents, ferns, pothos, and small ornamental grasses. Consider the plant's mature size and lighting requirements when selecting varieties for your specific corner planter location. 

Some planters have tiered designs, allowing you to create multi-level displays with taller plants in the back and smaller ones in the front. This arrangement helps prevent smaller plants from being overshadowed by taller ones. 


### Can I install wall-mounted corner planters indoors or outdoors?

Many wall-mounted corner planters work well in both indoor and outdoor environments. However, check the material and water collection system to ensure they can handle outdoor conditions if you plan to place them on patios or balconies. 

For indoor installation, consider wall materials and whether they can support the weight of your chosen planter. Some models feature mounting brackets that secure directly to concrete, brick, or drywall, making them adaptable for various interior spaces. 


### How do I care for plants in corner planters?

Care requirements vary by plant species, but most corner planter plants need regular watering, pruning, and occasional fertilization. The built-in water collection systems often need cleaning and emptying when full. 

Monitor for signs of pests or disease, checking both the soil and leaves for early indicators. The unique positioning can affect air circulation, so pay extra attention to this aspect when troubleshooting plant health issues. 


### What maintenance does the planter itself need?

Regularly inspect the planter for signs of wear or damage, especially if it's wall-mounted or exposed to outdoor elements. Some models require monthly checks on water collection systems and drainage holes. 

Depending on the material, periodic cleaning may be necessary. Wood planters might need a fresh coat of sealant, while metal ones could benefit from regular rust prevention treatments. Always follow the manufacturer's recommendations for specific maintenance needs.
