## Buyer's Guide

Crafting with paint requires more than just canvas and brushes – it's about finding the right tools that make your creative process smooth and enjoyable. Here's what to consider when selecting materials for your next artistic endeavor. 


### Types of Paint

Traditional artist's acrylics offer excellent coverage and durability, while watercolors provide a lighter, more translucent option ideal for delicate washes. For experimental mixed-media projects, consider urethane-based enamels that adhere well to various surfaces. 


### Brush Quality and Variety

Invest in synthetic or nylon brushes that hold paint well and resist tangling. A good brush collection includes basics like flat and round brushes in sizes ranging from fine detail to large wash brushes. 


### Care and Maintenance

Proper brush care extends their lifespan – always clean brushes thoroughly with mild soap and water, then reshape the bristles and let them dry completely before storing. Consider dedicated brush cleaners and organizers to keep your tools in top condition. 


### Personal Preferences and Project Requirements

Smaller works may only need a single paint tube and basic set of brushes, while larger or more complex projects require comprehensive supplies. Reflect on your typical workflow and storage capabilities when determining your paint and tool needs.

### How should Craft Smart Paint be stored?

Store open paint containers in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Keep them sealed when not in use to prevent drying out and contamination. 

Dispose of any paint that has separated, hardened, or developed mold. If the paint becomes partially dried, you can try remixing it with a small amount of water before use. 


### What is the consistency of Craft Smart Paint?

Craft Smart Paint has a moderately thick consistency, similar to traditional acrylic paints. The creamy texture applies smoothly and coverage is good with one coat. 

For heavier applications or mixing with other mediums, you may find the paint a bit thick. In this case, adding a small amount of water can achieve the desired consistency. 


### How long does Craft Smart Paint last?

Unopened containers of Craft Smart Paint typically maintain their quality for 2-3 years from the purchase date. The color and consistency may degrade if stored improperly. 

Open containers should be used within 6-12 months for optimal performance. If you notice changes in color intensity or texture, it's best to replace the paint.
