## FAQ


### What makes the Hoover Smartwash unique compared to other automatic cleaners?

The Hoover Smartwash stands out with its advanced automatic cleaning system that handles dusting, sweeping, and vacuuming without human intervention. It features a built-in Smart Dirt Sensor that optimizes cleaning patterns based on the carpet's dirt levels. 

The primary difference is in its automated operation and intelligent dirt detection capabilities, compared to traditional manual vacuum cleaners or basic automatic models. 


### Can the Smartwash handle different types of carpets?

Yes, the Smartwash is designed to clean various carpet types including plush, loop, and berber. It adjusts its cleaning intensity based on the carpet's pile depth to prevent damage while ensuring effective dirt removal. 

For optimal results, it's best to use it on carpets with a pile height of 0.25 to 1.5 inches. It performs less effectively on shorter cut-pile carpets or rugs. 


### How long does the Smartwash's battery last?

On a single charge, the Smartwash can run continuously for up to 60 minutes. This typically allows for thorough cleaning of an entire room or multiple rooms in one session. 

When the battery is low, it automatically returns to its charging station to recharge. A full charge takes about 2.5 hours, providing enough power for multiple cleaning sessions. 


### What additional features enhance its cleaning performance?

Aside from its automatic dirt sensor, the Smartwash includes an LED wall display showing its cleaning status and battery level. It also has a built-in dirt filter that removes 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns from the air. 

During cleaning, it produces minimal noise (40 decibels) and operates on a quiet mode to avoid disturbing household activities. 


### How easy is it to maintain and empty the Smartwash?

Regular maintenance is straightforward with a programmable schedule for washing and drying the internal filter. To empty, it automatically switches to upright position after cleaning, allowing the dust containing dust cup to pivot outwards for easy access. 

Both the dust cup and filter require monthly cleaning to maintain optimal performance and prevent clogging. 


### What is the recommended cleaning schedule?

The Smartwash operates most efficiently with a twice-weekly cleaning cycle for high-traffic areas. For regular maintenance, it should be emptied and filtered every 1-2 weeks based on usage levels. 

Heavier use or specific cleaning needs, such as pet hair removal, may require more frequent use according to the Smart Dirt Sensor's recommendations.
