## Buyer's Guide

Clive Christian perfumes blend rich, woody tones with sophisticated floral notes, creating complex fragrances that evolve on the skin. Understanding the key elements that make up these sophisticated scents can help you choose a fragrance that matches your personal style and preferences. 


### Base Notes

Base notes form the foundation of a perfume, developing most strongly after the top notes have faded. Common base notes in Clive Christian fragrances include sandalwood, amber, and vetiver, which contribute depth and longevity to the scent. 


### Middle Notes

Middle notes bridge the gap between the initial top notes and the deeper base fragrance. These typically include rich floral elements like jasmine, rose, and gardenia, as well as spices and resins that add complexity to the scent profile. 


### Top Notes

Top notes are the first scents you encounter when applying a perfume and dominate the initial impression. In Clive Christian fragrances, these may include citrus elements like bergamot or grapefruit, fresh herbs, or sparkling accords that create brightness and interest. 


### Fragrance Intensity

Clive Christian offers both EDP (Eau de Parfum) and Eau de Toilette variants for each fragrance. EDPs contain more concentrated essential oils and generally have a stronger, longer-lasting scent projection. Consider whether you prefer a more subtle daytime fragrance or a full-bodied scent ideal for evening wear.
