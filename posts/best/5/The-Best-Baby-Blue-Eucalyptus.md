## Buyer's Guide

Baby blue eucalyptus brings a fresh, natural touch to any space, known for its delicate blue color and subtle fragrance. Understanding the specific needs of eucalyptus can help you maintain its beauty and health.

Water your eucalyptus once a week, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. The plant thrives in well-draining soil to prevent root rot. 


### Size and Growth

Known for its rapid growth, baby blue eucalyptus can reach up to 4 feet tall indoors. Prune regularly to maintain its shape and encourage bushier growth.
