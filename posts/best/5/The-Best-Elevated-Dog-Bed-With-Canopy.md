### How do I clean an elevated dog bed with canopy?

Most elevated beds come with washable covers that can be removed and machine washed. Check the care instructions for specific recommendations, but expect to wash the cover every 1-2 weeks depending on usage. 

For regular maintenance, simply shake out the bed weekly and spot clean as needed. If using a heating pad, remove it when cleaning and clean the bed's surface thoroughly. 


### What's the difference between indoor and outdoor elevated dog beds?

Indoor beds are typically made from washable fabrics and may include heating elements for cold climates. They're designed for regular cleaning and are suitable for daily use in a home environment. 

Outdoor beds use weather-resistant materials and often lack heating options. They're built to withstand exposure to elements and require less frequent cleaning, making them ideal for porches, patios, or car travel.
