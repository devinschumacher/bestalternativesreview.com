## FAQ


### What is a daiquiri machine?

A daiquiri machine is a specialized kitchen appliance designed to blend and serve frozen or blended daiquiris and similar drinks. These machines combine multiple ingredients to create creamy, smooth frozen cocktails. 

Unlike traditional blenders, daiquiri machines are specifically engineered to handle frozen drinks without ice, maintaining the drink's consistency and temperature during serving.

### Are daiquiri machines easy to maintain?

Most manufacturers recommend regular cleaning of the machine's blending container and lid after each use. Some models have dishwasher-safe parts for convenience. 

Special attention should be given to cleaning around the motor area and ensuring the machine is completely dry before storage to prevent electrical issues.
