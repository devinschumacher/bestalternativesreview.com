## Buyer's Guide

When selecting a Corsair 60 keyboard, several key factors influence performance, durability, and functionality. Understanding these aspects helps you choose a keyboard that matches your gaming, typing, or professional needs. 


### Keyboard Layout and Design

Corsair 60 keyboards feature a 60% layout, omitting the traditional numpad for a more compact design while retaining essential keys. This layout maximizes finger dexterity and workspace efficiency, particularly suitable for small-form-factor builds or setups with limited desk space. 


### Switch Options

Switch quality significantly impacts typing and gaming accuracy. Common options include Cherry MX switches (MX Brown for balanced response, MX Speed for faster actuation), and analog switches (like Romer-G). The choice depends on whether you prioritize tactile feedback, speed, or both. 


### Connectivity and Compatibility

Modern Corsair 60 keyboards support multiple connectivity methods: wired USB for reliability, wireless via Bluetooth or 2.4GHz USB receiver for mobility, and N-Key Rollover and Anti-Ghosting for advanced keyboarding features. Consider your primary use case to determine which connection method is most appropriate. 


### Build Quality and Durability

Keycap material ranges from ABS plastic for budget options to PBT for premium models, affecting durability and typing feel. Switch durability typically exceeds 50 million presses, but PBT keycaps last longer under daily use. The aluminum or PBT frame adds weight and premium feel, while maintaining decent portability.

Each 60 keyboard includes features like RGB lighting customization, N-key rollover for reliable performance, and customizable RGB backlit keys for both aesthetic and functional enhancement. 


### Which Corsair 60 keyboard has the best build quality?

Corsair's 60 keyboard lineup includes both membrane and mechanical switches. The mechanical switches provide superior tactile feedback and durability, making them the best option for daily use. The K65 RGB MK. 2 and K68 RGB MK. 2 models, featuring this switch type, deliver exceptional build quality. 

These models feature aluminum build qualities in their respective cases and premium switches that offer guaranteed 50 million keystrokes before needing replacement, making them the most durable options in the lineup. 


### Can I use these keyboards with Mac or Linux computers?

Corsair 60 keyboards use standard USB connectivity and are plug-and-play compatible with both Mac and Linux computers. They do not require any additional drivers for basic functionality. 

While the vast majority of users will find these keyboards compatible right out of the box, users with specialized needs may want to check for any specific software requirements or additional configuration options through Corsair's website. 


### What size and layout options are available?

The Corsair 60 keyboard lineup features both 60% and TKL (104 key) layouts. The 60% models offer the most significant space savings, while still including essential multimedia keys and USB ports for additional devices. 

Users can choose between various form factors, including horizontal, vertical (tenting), and compact designs, with options for both membrane and mechanical switches to suit different typing preferences and space requirements. 


### How much do these keyboards typically cost?

Corsair 60 keyboards generally fall between $80 and $150, depending on the specific model and switch type. Mechanical switches and RGB lighting features add to the overall cost but provide enhanced durability and customization options.

### What warranty do Corsair 60 keyboards offer?

Corsair backs their 60 keyboards with a standard one-year warranty that covers manufacturing defects and issues with the switches. Mechanical switches are covered for 10 years, but this warranty doesn't cover normal wear and tear or accidental damage.
