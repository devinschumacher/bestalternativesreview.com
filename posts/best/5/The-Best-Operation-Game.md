Unlike traditional cooperative games that rely solely on strategy or communication, this game requires players to overcome sensory challenges and trust their teammates completely. 

The blindfolded mechanic adds a layer of difficulty that tests trust and communication, while the modular design allows for endless replayability with different puzzle configurations. 


### Is Operation Game suitable for virtual or online play?

While the physical components of Operation Game make it challenging to adapt directly for virtual play, the core concept can be simulated with some creative modifications. Online platforms can facilitate the cooperative aspect through video conferencing and text-based instructions. 

For the full gaming experience, we recommend traditional board game play. However, the digital versions available through some gaming apps can provide an engaging alternative for remote play sessions.
