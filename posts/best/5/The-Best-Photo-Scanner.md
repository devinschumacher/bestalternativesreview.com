## Buyer's Guide

Photo scanners transform treasured paper memories into digital assets, making them more accessible and preserveable. Not all scanners are created equal, though - factors like resolution, document feed capabilities, and connectivity options significantly impact the quality and convenience of your scanning experience. 


### Resolution

The primary measurement of a photo scanner's capabilities is its resolution, expressed in dots per inch (dpi). For most home and office use, 1200 dpi provides excellent balance between image quality and file size. Higher resolutions are useful for professional applications requiring archival quality prints. 

![Photo-Scanner-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Photo-Scanner-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Document Feeders

Automatic document feeders (ADF) are essential for handling larger volumes of photos without manual page-turning. They're particularly useful for scanning multi-page documents and thick books. Consider ADF capacity - the number of sheets that can be scanned in one go. Professional-grade scanners often offer two ADF units for faster batch scanning. 


### Connectivity Options

The scanner must connect to your existing technology ecosystem. USB remains the most common connection type, but networked scanners provide more flexibility, especially in office environments. Wi-Fi connectivity allows wireless scanning directly to computers or mobile devices, eliminating the need for physical cables. 

![Photo-Scanner-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Photo-Scanner-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Software and Features

Basic photo scanners include bundled software for simple image processing. For serious users, consider models with advanced features like OCR (optical character recognition) for scanned documents, automatic page curl correction, and support for negative film scanning. Consider the operating system compatibility of included software packages to match your existing setup. 


## FAQ

![Photo-Scanner-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Photo-Scanner-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a photo scanner?

A photo scanner is a device that captures images of physical photos and converts them into digital format. These scanners use optical technology to read the visual information on photos and transform it into a digital file that can be edited, shared, or stored electronically. 

Modern photo scanners typically offer high resolutions for detailed image capture and may include features like automatic document feed, color correction, and border removal to enhance the digital output. 


### How does a photo scanner work?

Photo scanners use optical sensors to capture images of photos placed on the scanner bed. The scanner converts light patterns from the photo into digital data, which is then processed to create a digital image file. 

After scanning, the image can be saved as various digital formats, such as JPEG, PDF, or TIFF, depending on the scanner and software being used. 

![Photo-Scanner-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Photo-Scanner-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What types of photos can be scanned?

Most photo scanners can handle standard photo sizes including 4x6 inches, 5x7 inches, and 8x10 inches. Some specialized models can scan larger formats or specialty photos like negatives and transparencies. 

The best results come from photos in good condition with no significant damage or fading. Photos in poor condition may require additional processing to improve their digital quality. 


### What features should I look for in a photo scanner?

Key features include resolution (measured in DPI), color depth, and scanning speed. For detailed photos, look for scanners with at least 1200 DPI resolution. Color depth affects image quality, with 24-bit and 30-bit being common requirements. 

Additional features like automatic document feed, border removal, and paper path controls can enhance the scanning process and produce better results. 

![Photo-Scanner-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Photo-Scanner-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do I maintain a photo scanner?

Regular maintenance includes cleaning the glass surface and sensor with appropriate cleaning solutions. Avoid touching the glass directly and use soft cloths for cleaning to prevent damage or scratches. 

Between scans, allow time for the scanner's glass to return to room temperature and power cycles can help maintain optimal performance. 


### What is the difference between flatbed and sheet-fed photo scanners?

Flatbed scanners have a glass surface where photos are placed directly for scanning. They can handle larger photos and multiple sheet feeding, making them suitable for scanning albums or larger formats. 

SHEET-fed scanners use a paper path to feed photos one at a time into the scanner. They are more compact and typically faster for single-page scanning but may not handle larger photos as effectively as flatbed models.
