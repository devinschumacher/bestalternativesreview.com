## Buyer's Guide

Gummy sharks combine delightful flavor with a fun, chewy texture, making them a popular snack choice for all ages. When selecting gummy sharks, consider a few key factors to find the perfect treat that balances taste and quality. 


### Flavor Selection

These sharks come in various flavors, from classic fruit options like strawberry and blue raspberry to unique combinations like watermelon and sour apple. Consider whether you prefer natural fruit flavors or bold candy flavors, and think about sharing the treats with others who might have different taste preferences.

Proper storage can significantly impact the shelf life and quality of your gummy sharks. Opt for products sealed in airtight packaging to maintain freshness. Store them in a cool, dry place to prevent melting or softening. Check the expiration date before purchasing and keep an eye on signs of spoilage when storing opened packages.
