## Buyer's Guide

A riving knife is a crucial safety feature in a table saw, preventing severe accidents by eliminating the danger between the blade and the saw's splitter during cross-cutting operations. This guide outlines essential aspects of riving knives to help you select the right safety component for your table saw. 


### Key Features of a Riving Knife

Standard riving knives project between the saw blade teeth and the saw's stationary table, extending across the full width of the blade. Advanced models feature adjustable heights and positions, allowing precise blade-to-knife clearance for various thicknesses of cutting material. Look for blades made from durable, corrosion-resistant material like stainless steel. 


### Selecting the Proper Height and Position

The riving knife should sit between 1/32 to 1/16 inch above the blade teeth when cutting stock narrower than the blade diameter. For wider cuts, adjust the knife's position so it's flush with the blade but remains above the table surface, ensuring the blade's trailing edge is consistently protected during cross-cuts. 


### Additional Safety Considerations

Pair your riving knife with a featherboard or backup system for optimal chip evacuation and reduced kickback during cross-cutting operations. Consider models with adjustable overhang, which can prevent the knife from contacting the workpiece while maintaining adequate blade protection. 


### Maintenance and Storage

Regularly inspect the riving knife for wear or damage, and apply appropriate lubrication to moving parts according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Store the component in a dry location when not in use to extend its operational lifespan and ensure consistent performance during future cutting operations. 


## FAQ


### What is a riving knife?

A riving knife is a critical safety tool for table saws, positioned between the blade and the saw table. Its primary function is to prevent kickback by maintaining proper blade height clearance and positioning downstream of the blade. 

By keeping the blade's upper cutting edge above the table surface, the riving knife ensures that any piece of wood that kickbacks will be guided safely away from the blade, significantly reducing the risk of serious injury. 


### What materials are riving knives typically made from?

Modern riving knives are usually made from high-strength aluminum or stainless steel, offering durability and resistance to wear. These materials maintain their shape and integrity under repeated use and exposure to sawdust and moisture. 

Some premium models incorporate composite materials for enhanced durability, while others feature adjustable components that allow users to customize the blade height clearance based on their specific cutting needs. 


### How does a riving knife prevent kickback?

A riving knife prevents kickback by extending downstream of the blade and maintaining a precise distance from the saw table. This positioning ensures that if a piece of wood kicks back, it will encounter the riving knife before reaching the blade, which then redirects it away from the cutting area. 

The knife's effective height is typically adjustable to accommodate different blade heights and wood thicknesses. This precise control allows for both accurate cuts and enhanced safety during operation. 


### Can a riving knife be used with any table saw?

Most table saws manufactured after 2000 are designed to accept standard riving knives, making them widely compatible. However, older saws or specialty models may require specific adapters or modifications to properly install a riving knife. 

Always check your saw's manual and verify compatibility before purchasing. Professional models often offer enhanced riving knife features, such as automatic height adjustment and precise blade clearance. 


### What are the maintenance requirements for riving knives?

Regular maintenance of a riving knife includes cleaning after each use to remove sawdust and debris. Check for wear, ensuring the knife remains straight and true to its original position. Replace or sharpen components as needed to maintain proper blade clearance. 

Inspect the knife for any signs of deformation or damage, particularly after extended use. Store the knife in a dry location when not in use to prevent rust and maintain its operational integrity. 


### Are riving knives required by law?

While not mandatory in all jurisdictions, riving knives are strongly recommended by woodworking safety organizations worldwide. Their effectiveness in preventing serious kickback injuries makes them a standard safety accessory for table saws.
