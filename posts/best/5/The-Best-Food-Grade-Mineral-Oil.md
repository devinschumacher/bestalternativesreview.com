## FAQ


### What is Food Grade Mineral Oil?

Food Grade Mineral Oil is a specially refined form of mineral oil that meets strict purity standards for direct contact with food. It's made from petroleum and goes through multiple filtration and purification steps to remove impurities. 

Unlike other forms of mineral oil, food grade variants are certified safe for use in foods, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics where purity and composition are critical. The most common food grade classification is USP (United States Pharmacopeia) Grade, which sets specific standards for quality and purity. 


### What are the main uses of Food Grade Mineral Oil?

Food grade mineral oil finds applications in food processing, cooking, and food storage. It's used as an anti-sticking agent in cookware coatings, as a lubricant in food machinery, and as a safe replacement for regular mineral oil in foods that require refined oil. 

Some common foods that might contain certified food grade mineral oil include bottled salad dressings, cooking sprays, and certain types of natural health supplements. It's also used as a finishing oil for some foods to prevent moisture loss while maintaining freshness. 


### How do I identify food grade mineral oil products?

Food grade mineral oil products should prominently display "USP Grade Mineral Oil" or "Food Grade Mineral Oil" on the label. Packages will list their intended food contact use and may carry certifications from regulatory bodies like USDA or FDA. 

Look for products that provide detailed purity information, including particle count and filtration methods. Always choose products from reputable manufacturers that specialize in food grade mineral oil for safe use in food processing and storage. 


### Can food grade mineral oil be used in cooking?

Food grade mineral oil has a neutral taste and odor, making it suitable for low-heat cooking applications where it won't be consumed in large quantities. It's often used in cooking oils, candy making, and as a component in cooking sprays. 

While safe for cooking, it's not recommended as a primary cooking oil due to its lack of flavor and smoke point (about 450°F or 232°C). It's ideal for applications where regular oils might react with metal or where you need an oil that won't change the flavor of your food. 


### Is food grade mineral oil safe for storing food?

Yes, food grade mineral oil is safe for storing food when used properly. Its primary function in food storage is to prevent moisture loss, protect food from freezer burn, and maintain freshness without affecting taste or nutrients. 

To use it safely, apply a thin, even layer to the surface of foods in sealed containers or use it as a topping on prepared foods before refrigeration or freezing. Avoid using it directly in microwaveable containers as it may not distribute heat evenly or react with certain materials. 


### Should I wash food after it comes into contact with food grade mineral oil?

While food grade mineral oil is safe for use in food preparation and storage, washing produce or food after contact with mineral oil is a good practice. This removes any excess oil and ensures fresh foods maintain their optimal texture and flavor. 

Use mild soap and water to wash food before consumption, especially if the mineral oil is applied as a finishing layer or if the food is raw. Proper cleaning helps prevent any lingering oily residue and maintains food quality during storage and preparation.
