## Buyer's Guide

Probiotics have become increasingly popular for their potential health benefits, and men specifically may benefit from strains tailored to male physiology. When selecting a probiotic supplement or food, consider factors such as strain specificity, total CFU count, shelf stability, and formulation type. 


### Strain Specificity and Male Health

Research suggests certain probiotic strains may have different effects based on gender. Look for products that include strains shown to support male health, such as Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis, possibly in combination with strains specific to urogenital health like Lactobacillus reuteri. 


### CFU Count and Stability

Colony-forming units (CFUs) measure live probiotic counts. For general health maintenance, products with 1-10 billion CFUs may be sufficient. However, for specific health concerns or immune support, higher CFU counts (10-50 billion) might be recommended. Check the expiration date and storage requirements to ensure the product maintains its potency. 


### Formulation and Delivery

Probiotics can be delivered through supplements, yogurt, kefir, or other fermented foods. Consider delivery systems that protect strains during production and storage, such as enteric coating, capsules, or tablets. For men with digestive concerns, capsule forms may be more effective than foods that require extensive preparation. 


### Ingredients and Allergies

Review the full ingredient list for potential allergens, especially if you have sensitivities. Common allergens include dairy (for lactobacillus strains), soy, and gluten. Additionally, look for products that support digestive health beyond probiotics, such as prebiotics or digestive enzymes, which can enhance absorption and effectiveness. 


## FAQ
