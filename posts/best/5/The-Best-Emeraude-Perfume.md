## Buyer's Guide

Emeraude Perfume combines rich, woody notes with subtle floral accords to create a sophisticated and unforgettable scent. The fragrance opens with sharp citrus and green apple top notes that give way to a heart of jasmine and rose, all set against a base of patchouli and amber. 


### Top Notes

Emeraude's top notes of citrus and green apple provide immediate freshness and wakefulness to the scent. These lighter, more volatile components quickly evaporate, giving way to the heart notes but leaving behind a pleasant initial impression. 


### Heart Notes

The fragrance's core is formed by jasmine and rose, which create a rich, floral center. These middle notes offer both sweetness and complexity, while also providing a strong foundation for the base notes to develop upon. 


### Base Notes

At the heart of Emeraude is a blend of patchouli and amber, which provide depth and lasting power to the fragrance. These heavier notes anchor the scent and ensure that it maintains its character even after the top and heart notes have dissipated. 


### Application and Longevity

Emeraude exhibits medium longevity, with its effects lasting approximately 6-8 hours on average. To enhance both intensity and duration, applying the perfume to pulse points such as the wrist, neck, and behind the ears can help trap more of the fragrance against the skin.
