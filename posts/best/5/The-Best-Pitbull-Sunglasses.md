### Lens Options and UV Protection

Most Pitbull sunglasses offer UV400 protection, blocking 100% of UVA and UVB rays. Consider polarization for reduced glare in sunny conditions. Lens colors range from classic gray and brown to more intense options like purple and rose, each affecting visual contrast and comfort levels differently. 


### Fit and Comfort

Try on several pairs to find the most comfortable fit. Opt for temples that wrap around behind your ears and nose pads that distribute pressure evenly across your nose. Adjustability features like temple arms that snap or slide can enhance both comfort and secure fit.
