## Buyer's Guide

A cordless paint sprayer combines the efficiency of professional spray painting with the convenience of portable power, making it an ideal tool for both home and professional painters. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the right sprayer for your specific painting needs. 


### Power Source and Runtime

Essential for mobility, cordless paint sprayers require a reliable power source. Lithium-ion batteries offer longer runtime and faster charging compared to older nickel-cadmium or nickel-metal hydride batteries. The runtime should match your project size, typically ranging from 20 to 60 minutes per charge. 


### Paint Capacity and Compatibility

The sprayer's paint reservoir determines how much paint you can apply before refilling. Common capacities range from 1 to 5 gallons, with larger tanks reducing downtime between fills. Check compatibility with your specific paint type, as some sprayers may require special mixing or filtering for water-based or specialized paints. 


### Paint Flow and Spraying Patterns

The sprayer's paint flow rate and nozzle options significantly affect coverage and finish quality. Higher flow rates increase paint application speed, while adjustable nozzles allow for different spray patterns suitable for various painting tasks and surfaces. Common patterns include fan, cone, and mist for diverse application needs. 


### Weight, Size, and Ergonomics

Compact designs with ergonomic features enhance comfort during extended use, particularly important for large projects. The sprayer's weight affects handling, with some models designed for single-handed operation. Consider the total weight, including battery, to ensure manageable carrying and use.
