## Buyer's Guide

Aquasana water filters are popular for their effectiveness in removing contaminants from household water. When considering an Aquasana filter, several key factors will influence your choice, including water source, flow rate requirements, and desired filtration stage. 


### Water Source Compatibility

Aquasana filters are suitable for both city water and well water. However, the appropriate filtration stage may vary based on your water source. City water typically requires fewer stages of filtration compared to well water, which may contain different contaminants. Testing your water quality before selecting a filter ensures you choose an appropriate filtration system. 


### Filter Stage Requirements

Aquasana offers filters with single-stage, dual-stage, and triple-stage filtration capabilities. Single-stage filters are suitable for basic sediment removal, while dual-stage filters add activated carbon for taste and odor improvement. For optimal water purification, consider a triple-stage filter that includes activated carbon, coconut shell carbon, and KDF-55 technology for comprehensive contaminant removal. 


### Flow Rate Considerations

The filter's flow rate must match your water usage requirements. Kitchen sinks typically need a flow rate between 0.5 to 1 gallon per minute, while bathrooms may require 0.3 to 0.5 gallons per minute. Filters with slower flow rates may need additional storage, while those with higher flow rates could strain your household's water pressure. 


### Maintenance and Filter Replacement

Regular maintenance extends filter life and ensures consistent performance. Most Aquasana filters require monthly checks and occasional pre-filters changes. The main filter elements typically need replacement every 6 to 12 months, depending on water usage and contamination levels. Proper maintenance schedules prevent filter bypass and maintain water quality.
