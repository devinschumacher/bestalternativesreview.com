## Buyer's Guide

Clic Glasses are specialized eyewear designed to help individuals with certain visual impairments. They are different from regular glasses and require careful consideration when selecting the appropriate style and prescription. 


### Understanding Clic Glass Technology

Clic Glasses use a proprietary alignment system that requires precise calibration to work effectively. This technology helps users more accurately focus on their surroundings, making them particularly useful for people with accommodative insufficiency or convergence insufficiency. 

![CliC-Glasses-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/CliC-Glasses-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Prescription Considerations

Unlike standard glasses, Clic Glasses need to be individually calibrated rather than simply adjusted with a different prescription. The process involves an in-office examination to determine the exact alignment requirements for optimal vision correction. 

Regular glasses prescriptions will not work with Clic Glasses and must be obtained through a qualified optometrist or ophthalmologist who specializes in this technology. 


### Frame Selection

Frame selection is crucial for Clic Glasses as the alignment system needs to be positioned correctly at the lens edge. Frames with adjustable temple tips or a slightly larger than average bridge width may provide better compatibility with the specialized equipment used for calibration. 

Investing in frames specifically designed for Clic Glasses can help ensure proper alignment and maintain the integrity of your prescription.

### Maintenance and Care

These glasses require regular cleaning and maintenance to preserve their alignment and ensure optimal vision. Standard lens cleaning solutions should be used, but more frequent cleaning may be necessary depending on your environment and usage. 

Storage is also important to maintain the glasses' alignment. Keeping them in the provided case when not in use can help prevent accidental damage or misalignment. 


## FAQ

![CliC-Glasses-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/CliC-Glasses-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are Clic Glasses?

Clic Glasses are specialized glasses designed to correct common vision issues like myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism. Unlike traditional glasses, these lenses adjust their focus based on your eye's natural movement, potentially reducing eye strain and improving visual comfort. 

The lenses contain micro-lenses that refract light differently depending on your line of sight and eye movement, providing clearer vision without the need for constant adjustment. 


### Who should consider using Clic Glasses?

Clic Glasses may be particularly beneficial for individuals who experience eye strain, blurred vision, or headaches during prolonged screen time. They're also suitable for those who frequently switch between different distances, like computer work followed by driving. 

While they can help many people with vision correction needs, they may not be ideal for those with extreme vision issues or who require very high prescriptions. 

![CliC-Glasses-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/CliC-Glasses-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do Clic Glasses compare to regular glasses?

Clic Glasses offer several advantages over conventional corrective lenses. They adapt to your natural eye movements, potentially reducing eye fatigue and offering clearer vision across multiple focal points. The adjustable focal mechanism can also help maintain consistent visual quality during activities that require frequent focus changes. 

However, they may not provide the same level of precision for extreme prescriptions or specific visual demands, such as fine detail work or sports requiring rapid shifts in focus. 


### Are Clic Glasses difficult to adjust to?

Most users report an easy transition to Clic Glasses, with the lenses adapting naturally to their visual habits within a few days. The adjustable focus helps many people reduce reliance on built-in magnifiers or reading glasses for various distances. 

Some individuals might experience temporary discomfort during the initial adaptation period as their eyes adjust to the new focusing mechanism. This typically resolves within a week of regular use. 

![CliC-Glasses-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/CliC-Glasses-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How long do Clic Glasses last?

The durability of Clic Glasses varies based on usage frequency and care. With daily use, the lenses typically maintain their performance for 2-3 years before requiring replacement. The micro-lens structure is more susceptible to wear than traditional lenses, particularly in high-use environments like offices or classrooms. 

Regular maintenance, including proper cleaning and storage in the included protective case, can extend their lifespan and ensure optimal performance. 


### What maintenance do Clic Glasses require?

Proper maintenance is crucial for extending the life of your Clic Glasses and maintaining clear vision. Clean the lenses daily with the provided microfiber cloth or a similar soft cloth to remove dust and fingerprints. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive materials that could damage the micro-lens structure. 

Store the glasses in their protective case when not in use to prevent scratches and protect the adjustable focusing mechanism. Regularly inspect the frame for any signs of wear or damage, and replace the glasses if vision quality deteriorates or the focusing mechanism becomes unreliable.
