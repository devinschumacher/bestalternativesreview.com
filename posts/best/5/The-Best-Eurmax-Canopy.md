## Buyer's Guide

Our Eurmax Canopy guide evaluates key aspects of these structures, from material durability to customization options, to help you select the ideal shelter for your space.

### Frame Design and Stability

The canopy frame's design impacts both stability and appearance. Look for triangular trusses or A-frames that provide superior rigidity. The base should incorporate heavy-duty footplates and ground anchors for wind resistance. 


### Cover Options and Maintenance

Choosing between PVC and ETFE films depends on your needs. PVC covers are more economical and resistant to fading, while ETFE offers superior transparency and requires less frequent cleaning. Consider the included warranty and maintenance requirements.
