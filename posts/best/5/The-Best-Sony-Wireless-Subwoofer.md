## Buyer's Guide

Sony's wireless subwoofers combine powerful bass production with the convenience of wireless connectivity, offering an immersive audio experience. Understanding key features and considerations will help you select the right subwoofer for your entertainment setup. 


### Wireless Technology

Sony's subwoofers support multiple wireless connection methods including Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and NFC pairing. Bluetooth allows easy connection to smartphones and tablets, while Wi-Fi supports multi-room audio and app control. NFC simplifies the connection process through quick tap functionality. 


### Audio Performance

Key specifications include subwoofer size, which determines low-frequency extension, and power handling capacity. Look for subwoofers with at least 100 watts RMS for home theater use. Frequency response indicates the range of low frequencies produced, with professional-grade subwoofers typically offering 20-120 Hz. 


### Connectivity Options

While wireless connectivity offers convenience, some users prefer direct audio input through RCA, 3.5mm, or optical connections. Consider how many simultaneous connections you need, as some subwoofers can handle multiple inputs from different sources. 


### Size and Placement

Most wireless subwoofers have a cylindrical design for optimal bass radiation. Place the subwoofer near a wall or in a corner to enhance bass response. The subwoofer should sit on a level surface, with the speaker grill facing straight ahead to maintain sound accuracy. 


## FAQ


### What is a Sony wireless subwoofer?

A Sony wireless subwoofer delivers deep, powerful bass without the need for cables. The sound is transmitted wirelessly to the subwoofer via Bluetooth or NFC, making it perfect for modern living spaces where aesthetics matter. 

These subwoofers typically work in conjunction with Sony's wireless audio systems, including speakers and headphones, to create a rich, immersive sound experience. 


### How far can Bluetooth transmit?

Bluetooth transmission usually works within a range of 30 feet (10 meters) indoors, with some models offering extended range up to 100 feet in open spaces. 

Obstacles like walls and furniture can reduce this range, and interference from other electronic devices may affect stability. For the best performance, keep the subwoofer and Bluetooth source within 30 feet of each other. 


### What can I connect a Sony wireless subwoofer to?

The subwoofer can connect to Sony's wireless audio system, including speakers and headphones, to enhance the bass. It also works with non-Sony devices via Bluetooth. 

You can wirelessly connect a single source device, like a smartphone or TV, or use the input ports on the subwoofer for additional audio sources. 


### How do I pair the subwoofer with my device?

To pair via Bluetooth, turn on your device and the subwoofer, then select the subwoofer from your device's Bluetooth menu. For NFC pairing, simply tap the NFC tag on your device to automatically connect. 

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the connection process. The subwoofer will display connection status through its indicator lights. 


### What kind of power requirements does a Sony wireless subwoofer have?

Most models require a single USB-C power cable for charging. Some have a built-in battery that allows up to 16 hours of playback on a single charge. 

When using the subwoofer as a powered speaker, it can draw power from a compatible wireless audio system or use the USB-C port for charging. 


### How does the subwoofer manage sound calibration?

Sony's audio systems automatically calibrate the subwoofer for optimal performance based on the connected equipment. The subwoofer has built-in DSP (Digital Signal Processing) for precise sound management. 

You can manually adjust settings through the Sony Music Center app to fine-tune the bass response to your preference.
