## FAQ


### What is a Pokemon Advent Calendar?

A Pokemon Advent Calendar is a popular holiday tradition where children (and adults! ) count down the days until Christmas by opening a door each day to reveal a special Pokemon figure or collectible. These calendars combine the excitement of Christmas countdowns with the beloved world of Pokemon. 

The calendars typically feature 24 doors arranged in a 4x6 grid, with each door revealing a different Pokemon character. Many versions include rare or limited-edition Pokemon, adding extra value and excitement to the collection. 


### What Pokemon figures are included in the calendars?

Each day's Pokemon figure varies, featuring both common and rare characters from the Pokemon franchise. Popular versions include early game characters, legendary Pokemon, and regional variants. Some calendars also feature special edition figures, which can be more valuable to collectors. 

The specific roster changes yearly, but typically includes a mix of trainers, Pokémon, and Pokémon-related items. Early birds often get the most valuable editions, so it's worth checking multiple calendars to compare offerings. 


### How much do these calendars cost?

Basic Pokemon Advent Calendars generally range from $15 to $30, while premium versions with special editions or larger figures can cost between $30 and $70. Limited-edition calendars from popular retailers or featuring rare Pokemon can exceed $100. 

Cost can vary by region and retailer. It's advisable to compare prices between stores and consider purchasing from official Pokemon retailers to ensure authentic products.
