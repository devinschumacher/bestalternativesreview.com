## Buyer's Guide

"No Nothing" shampoos are designed for hair that appears lifeless, dull, or in need of reviving. These formulas are free from common hair care irritants, allowing your scalp and hair to return to their natural state. While these shampoos can deliver impressive results, they're not suitable for everyone and shouldn't be used daily. 


### Key Ingredients to Look For

Ingredients like panthenol, biotin, and hydrolyzed proteins can help restore moisture and elasticity. Look for botanical extracts such as rosemary, peppermint, and tea tree oil, which can soothe the scalp and promote healthy hair growth. 


### Formula Considerations

No Nothing shampoos typically contain clarifying agents like salicylic acid or sulfur to remove buildup. For severely damaged hair, consider formulas with dimethicone or ceramides to seal in moisture. If your scalp is sensitive, stick to mild cleansers without harsh sulfates or alcohol. 


### Usage Guidelines

These shampoos are most effective when used 1-2 times per week as part of a larger hair care routine. Use lukewarm water and massage gently into the scalp for optimal results. After using a No Nothing shampoo, always follow with a conditioner designed for your specific hair type. 


### Selecting the Right Product

Consider your hair type (dry, oily, normal) and scalp condition when choosing a No Nothing shampoo. Products formulated for dry or damaged hair may contain heavier ingredients, while oilier hair types might prefer a more lightweight, refreshing formula.
