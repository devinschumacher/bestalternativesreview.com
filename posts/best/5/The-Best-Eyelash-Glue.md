### [Lava Lash Lady Black Eyelash Extension Glue](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Eyelash+Glue?utm\_term=lava-lash-lady-black-eyelash-extension-glue)

![Lava Lash Lady Black Eyelash Extension Glue | Image](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcSEg\_zLYg3f2vzGJYZmNgvFP9Xa37JV5yfqUwZdtTTs8srG8g7d6ifOZSRtajlp1p3htxc\_QVdZwPFKYq6p9dMp\_OdyZiSO&usqp=CAY)

For professionals, this black lash glue dries in seconds while being kinder to sensitive eyes. At just 5ml, the bottle is easy to handle but packs a punch for lasting 5-6 weeks without clumping. 


### [Cala Eyelash Adhesive](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Eyelash+Glue?utm\_term=cala-eyelash-adhesive)

![Cala Eyelash Adhesive | Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcR\_qlZTF\_C6bg3xTBNiBaW-FuP0a0XLgzcCBzL30n9eNvEYX75kxycALsTpk3\_zRezlPl2jRJ8CsZA8RWGjzQA0bjdACk1M&usqp=CAY)

This adhesive comes in a tiny 1g bottle but manages to stretch your lash mascara tube pretty far. I wouldn't call it watery exactly, more like it's not thick enough to work well as a lash glue. The tacky point comes pretty slowly and your lashes won't stick properly when it does get there. 


### [Maxima Hold Adhesive Glue](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Eyelash+Glue?utm\_term=maxima-hold-adhesive-glue)

![Maxima Hold Adhesive Glue | Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcSaTlC392WyQMTpfsFi2ZT78p7h\_5KqSH8WbFW1iO\_s-gOfVAKi14J8dasFqCaTTrnwOviqMO7JqBJY1ZaZHgGrwuVTuNzm&usqp=CAY)

Lash technicians swear by the 0.5-second dry time and 6-7 week retention, but this German-engineered adhesive really shines during application. The thin consistency prevents clumping while the quick dry time cuts your service time dramatically. With 163 glowing reviews and a stellar 4.9 rating, it's clear why professionals switched from their old glue â€“ it works great with every type of pre-made lash they throw at it. 


### [Kiss Lash Couture Strip Lash Adhesive](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Eyelash+Glue?utm\_term=kiss-lash-couture-strip-lash-adhesive)

![Kiss Lash Couture Strip Lash Adhesive | Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcRYiVLnn0Jt9yefUAUnbGwI\_85H-yVODk4XTNEdJQGxTrH-1Q0&usqp=CAY)

Despite some initial issues, this runny lash adhesive has gained a devout following for its non-irritating formula and decent hold. The oat extract reportedly helps protect sensitive skin, though users note it requires precise application and patience to get right. While it's not for everyone, those who make it work report excellent overnight wear with minimal fallout. 


### [Stacy Lash Crystal Clear Eyelash Extension Glue](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Eyelash+Glue?utm\_term=stacy-lash-crystal-clear-eyelash-extension-glue)

This popular Korean-made eyelash adhesive has earned its cult status with its quick-drying formula and secure hold that resists even water. The waterproof dark formula lets my black eyeliner blend seamlessly with my false lashes, though some may prefer to test it first as it can be too strong for sensitive eyes. One user swears it's the best lash glue ever, while another warns it might not work for everyone, so it's worth trying a single tube before committing to a full set. 


### [Andrea Modlash Eyelash Adhesive](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Eyelash+Glue?utm\_term=andrea-modlash-eyelash-adhesive)

For those new to falsies, the clear latex-based glue dries quickly and holds lashes firmly in place.

## Buyer's Guide

Eyelash glue creates a strong bond between false lashes and natural eyelashes, making them adhere securely during wear. Understanding the key aspects of eyelash glue will help you select a product that offers the right balance of hold, comfort, and ease of application. 


### Ingredients and Formula

Look for lash glues containing medical-grade adhesives specifically formulated for ocular use. Ingredients like cyanoacrylate provide strong bonding, while rheology modifiers control the glue's consistency for smooth application. Consider products with faster drying times and clear formulas that allow easy removal.

### Application and Application Time

Choose a glue that dries quickly but allows sufficient time for proper application. Most effective bonding occurs within 15-30 seconds after application. Consider products that mark this timing on the tube or have clear formulas that indicate when the glue is ready. 


### Clean-Up and Removal

Effective clean-up requires a glue that comes off easily without residue. Look for products that dissolve in makeup remover or water. The removal process should be comfortable and gentle, with no sticky residue left behind on the eyelid.

### What is eyelash glue?

Eyelash glue is a specialized adhesive used to attach false lashes to the natural eyelashes. It combines quick-drying properties with flexibility to create a secure, natural-looking hold that lasts several hours. 

Most formulas contain either silicone or cyanoacrylate base, with various additives for durability and ease of application. Common ingredients include pigments for color matching and preservatives to extend product life. 


### What types of eyelash glues are available?

Silicone-based glues provide flexible holds and are easy to remove with make-up remover. Cyanoacrylate-based glues (super glues) create strong bonds but can be more challenging to remove. 

Matte and glossy options are available for different lash styles, while color-changing glues indicate proper application timing. Premium formulas may include vitamins and botanical extracts for lash health.

### How do I apply eyelash glue safely?

Clean the lash line with an oil-free make-up remover and allow it to dry completely before application. Apply a thin, even layer to the lash band, avoiding the center where lashes naturally grow. 

Count to 10 after application to prevent premature drying, then gently press the false lash into place. Use tweezers or a specialized applicator if needed to align and smooth the lashes. 


### How long does eyelash glue last?

Eyelash glue typically bonds effectively for 4-6 hours. Factors affecting duration include product quality, application technique, and environmental conditions. 

Heat and humidity can cause faster drying and less secure holds. Natural blinking and oil secretions from the eyelids can also affect the adhesive's longevity.

### Can I wash my face with eyelash glue on?

It's generally safe to wash your face with eyelash glue in place, as most formulas are designed to release easily under normal facial cleaners and water. 

Avoid scrubbing or using abrasive cleansers around the lashes. If you need to remove the glue before washing, use a gentle make-up remover and warm water. 


### How should I store eyelash glue?

Store the glue in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures. The optimal temperature range is typically 68-77Â°F (20-25Â°C). 

Avoid freezing the glue, as temperature fluctuations can affect its consistency and drying time. Check the product's specific storage instructions for optimal care.
