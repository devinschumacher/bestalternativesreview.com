The Sherpa Tote Around Town Pet Carrier combines a stylish design with practical features that make travel comfortable for both pet and owner. With its lightweight frame and breathable mesh panels, it keeps your dog cool during trips to the vet or a weekend getaway. The carrier's adjustable shoulder strap and padded support ensure the journey is as comfy as possible, though some might find the size a bit snug for smaller pets. The included faux lambskin liner and top-notch ventilation system make this carrier a decent choice despite a few drawbacks noted by other owners.

Travel with your pet in comfort and style with the Sherpa Element Carrier. This stylish gray carrier features top and side entry, mesh panels for ventilation, and a machine-washable faux lambskin liner. The airline-approved carrier includes a seat belt security strap and plenty of room for your pet to stretch out during your trip. 


### [Sherpa Forma Frame Airline Approved Pet Carrier](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Sherpa+Pet+Carrier?utm\_term=sherpa-forma-frame-airline-approved-pet-carrier)

![Sherpa Forma Frame Airline Approved Pet Carrier | Image](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcQHrOQikNkbyByjZIA7CldWWlD2d4D1gnzzTbi4hQdFNElbKzTCUQ3QT5YanOsedM5vu5dANXla1UGDuLA4lgckQM0ek5eI&usqp=CAY)

This black medium Sherpa pet carrier has earned high praise from owners who appreciate its sturdy construction and comfortable interior padding. The airline-approved carrier, which doubles as a portable carrier, offers convenient LATCH and car seat tether system compatibility while keeping pets secure during travel. With three windows and a fold-flat design, it provides both ventilation and easy storage. 


### [Sherpa Pet Tube Car Kennel](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Sherpa+Pet+Carrier?utm\_term=sherpa-pet-tube-car-kennel)

![Sherpa Pet Tube Car Kennel | Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcT4C45wzQ9Dx\_53zOdi0I3MB0tF78gwFTGdtOE4oZ4WYRwpz58&usqp=CAY)

This lightweight yet sturdy car kennel keeps pets safe and contained during trips while protecting your vehicle from scratches and spills. Made from durable, claw-resistant fabric that's easy to clean, the tube-shaped design gives your pet room to move around. When not in use, the kennel compresses into a small disk for convenient storage. 


### [Sherpa Sling Dog Carrier](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Sherpa+Pet+Carrier?utm\_term=sherpa-sling-dog-carrier)

![Sherpa Sling Dog Carrier | Image](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcSxgzaLXETszeLPLDde\_9MmPK0ruBG\_NTtwz-R\_3yHk1LO8ynoE&usqp=CAY)

While the Sherpa Sling's stylish design and soft jersey material make it a decent option for cuddly cats or small dogs, its poor construction becomes apparent when you're actually using it. The wide, tall main compartment lacks proper closure, making it dangerous for wriggly pets to ride in. And despite its advertised durability, the "flexible base panel" doesn't hold its shape, with several feet of loose fabric dangling helplessly behind. The included storage pocket is about as practical as a catnap for your furry friend.

## Buyer's Guide

A Sherpa pet carrier combines durability and comfort, making it an excellent choice for transporting your furry friend. These carriers typically feature sturdy construction, breathable mesh panels, and multiple carrying options. Understanding their key features will help you find the right carrier for your pet and your transport needs. 


### Size and Fit

Select a carrier that offers generous interior space while maintaining compact dimensions for easy transport. The width should allow your pet's comfortable movement, and the height should prevent them from easily jumping out. Check the measurements against your pet's body dimensions to ensure a proper fit. 


### Materials and Construction

Most Sherpa carriers use a durable base material, often canvas or similar textile, reinforced with padded metal corners and strengthened stitching at stress points. Consider carriers with reinforced floor panels to prevent wear from your pet's weight and movement. 


### Auxiliary Features

Look for carriers with multiple carrying options, including backpack straps, shoulder straps, and handle bars. Some models feature divided sections to separate small pets from larger ones or to provide privacy. Consider pockets for securing leashes, blankets, or pet toys. 


### Maintenance and Cleaning

Choose a carrier made from washable materials to maintain hygiene. Opt for carriers with removable or machine-washable inserts for easy cleaning between uses. The mesh panels should have secure closures to prevent escaping but remain breathable during transport.
