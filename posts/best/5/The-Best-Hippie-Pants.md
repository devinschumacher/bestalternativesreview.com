### What makes pants "hippie"?

Hippie pants typically feature loose, flowing silhouettes with natural, earthy fabrics like cotton and linen. They often include bohemian details such as fringes, embroidery, and tie-dye patterns, combining comfort with a laid-back, free-spirited aesthetic. 

The term "hippie pants" emerged in the 1960s and 1970s counterculture movement, where anti-establishment youth embraced unconventional fashion as an expression of their values. Today, these pants blend vintage influences with contemporary styles, appealing to those who appreciate relaxed, expressive clothing. 


### What fabrics are commonly used in hippie pants?
