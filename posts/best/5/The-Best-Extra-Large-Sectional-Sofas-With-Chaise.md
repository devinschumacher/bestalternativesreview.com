## Buyer's Guide

Extra large sectional sofas with chaises offer exceptional comfort and versatility for any living room. These pieces maximize seating while providing additional relaxation options through their chaise lounges. When selecting the right combination, consider several key factors to ensure a perfect fit and lasting satisfaction. 


### Size and Space

Measure your available space carefully before choosing an extra large sectional with chaise. Consider both horizontal and vertical dimensions to ensure the sofa fits through doors and turns corners properly. Additionally, measure the ceiling height to prevent any part of the sofa from unintentionally scraping against the ceiling.

### Build Quality and Materials

Invest in a frame made from solid wood or engineered wood with steel supports for durability. The seat and back should incorporate high-density foam cushioning with an upholstered top layer. Check the quality of stitching and joints to gauge the craftsmanship. 


### Chaise Functionality

Not all chaise sections recline, so confirm the desired functionality before purchase. Consider whether you need both sides to recline or just one. Also, check if the chaise has storage beneath it, which can be useful for blankets or other items.
