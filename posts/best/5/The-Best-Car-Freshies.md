Each Car Freshie product is crafted to provide a subtle yet distinct scent profile, allowing users to choose from various fragrances that complement their vehicle's interior while keeping pets safe and comfortable.

![Car-Freshies-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Car-Freshies-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Are Car Freshies safe for pets?

Yes, Car Freshies are formulated with pet-safe ingredients to ensure the well-being of your furry friends. These products avoid harsh chemicals and synthetic fragrances that could be harmful if ingested or inhaled by pets with sensitive respiratory systems. 

While Car Freshies are generally considered safe, it's always a good idea to introduce new products slowly and monitor your pet's reaction. Some pets may take time to adjust to new scents, so keep a close eye on their behavior and adjust the placement as needed. 


### Can Car Freshies be used in all vehicles?

Car Freshies can be safely used in both new and older vehicles, including cars, trucks, and SUVs. They're designed to fit easily into standard vehicle ventilation systems, whether your vehicle has factory-installed air fresheners or a simple ventilation port.

### What sizes are available?

Car Freshies come in multiple sizes to accommodate different vehicle spaces and preferences. Most products offer a choice between small and large options, with the larger size typically providing extended fragrance duration and better scent dispersion. 

The exact dimensions vary by product, so be sure to check the specific measurements for each Car Freshie you're considering. This ensures you select a size that fits your vehicle's ventilation system without blocking airflow. 


### How should I install a Car Freshie?

Installing a Car Freshie is simple and requires minimal effort. Start by removing the protective seal from the product's opening and positioning it in your vehicle's ventilation port or duct. Most products have a straightforward plug-and-go design that fits easily into standard ventilation systems. 

To maximize fragrance dispersion, avoid placing the Car Freshie too close to the vehicle's air intake or direct heat sources. The recommended installation height is typically between the dashboard and passenger seats, allowing the natural airflow to distribute the scent throughout the vehicle.
