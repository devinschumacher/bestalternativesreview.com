## Buyer's Guide

A double chaise sectional combines the comfort of a chaise lounge with the flexibility of a sectional sofa, perfect for creating a relaxing gathering space. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the right piece for your home. 


### Size and Space Requirements

Measure your available space before selecting a double chaise sectional. Consider the room's dimensions, doorways, and furniture placement to ensure the sofa fits comfortably. The standard depth of a double chaise sectional is 36 inches, so measure your space accordingly.

### Chaise Features

Chaise lounges offer additional seating while providing a place to rest your legs. Look for adjustable backrests that allow you to find your most comfortable position. Some chaises include ottomans that can be elevated to create extra storage or used as additional seating. 


### Frame and Construction

A solid wood frame with metal reinforcements offers the most durability. Look for sofas with at least 8-way hand-tied sprung seats for better cushion support and longevity. Consider the leg style and finish to match your existing furniture.

### Comfort Features

High-quality foam cushions with a supportive core provide superior comfort. Look for sofas that offer multiple density options to balance comfort and durability. Consider the fabric choice – breathable materials like canvas or cotton blend well with chaise lounges while providing good ventilation. 


## FAQ

![Double-Chaise-Sectional-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Double-Chaise-Sectional-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the key features of a double chaise sectional?

A double chaise sectional combines the comfort and versatility of traditional chaise lounges with the spatial efficiency of a sectional sofa. Each chaise typically features a longer seat with a gently sloping back, making it ideal for relaxing and reading. The chaise sections can be combined with a variety of seating configurations, including loveseats and armchairs, to create a flexible living space. 

The primary advantage of a double chaise sectional is its ability to provide multiple relaxation options in one piece of furniture. Unlike standard chaise lounges that stand alone, these sections integrate seamlessly with other seating pieces while offering the same plush comfort and generous proportions. 


### How does a double chaise sectional compare to other sectional designs?

Compared to traditional U-shaped or L-shaped sections, a double chaise adds distinct elements. While standard sections focus on efficient use of space, chaise units prioritize lounging comfort with their extra-long seats and sloped backs. This design approach requires careful consideration of available space and room dimensions to ensure optimal functionality. 

The greatest difference lies in the additional seating configuration options. Non-chaise sections offer a more straightforward layout, while chaise additions create more complex patterns that can extend around corners or create intimate nooks within a larger room.

### Are double chaise sections suitable for small living spaces?

The compact nature of double chaise sections makes them ideal for smaller rooms where traditional sofas might not fit. Their slim profiles and modular designs allow for efficient space utilization, making it possible to create a relaxing seating area without occupying vast amounts of floor space. 

However, the chaise sections themselves require careful placement to prevent awkwardly angled seating and ensure proper traffic flow through the room. In smaller spaces, it's crucial to consider how the extra-long chaise seats will impact overall room dimensions and functionality. 


### What materials are commonly used in double chaise sections?

Quality double chaise sections often feature premium materials like bonded leather, top-grain leather, or high-density foam cushioning. The chaise sections generally incorporate thicker cushions and more specialized foam layers to support the additional seating length while maintaining comfort. 

Upholstery fabrics vary from basic cotton blends to luxury performance fabrics that resist stains and fading. The base frames usually consist of engineered wood, steel, or solid wood construction, with metal legs providing stability for the longer chaise sections.

### How should I measure for a double chaise sectional?

When measuring for a double chaise sectional, account for the additional length of the chaise sections. Standard sofas measure about 80 inches from seat to seat, while chaise sections can extend this distance by 20-30 inches. Consider the complete length of the chaise sections when planning your space. 

Measure the distance between doorways, corners, and other obstacles to ensure the chaise sections can be maneuvered into place. Adding 15-20 inches to your measurements helps account for furniture placement and walking space. 


### What maintenance requirements should I expect?

Double chaise sections generally maintain their appearance well with regular cleaning. Leather surfaces should be wiped with a damp cloth and a leather-specific cleaner, while fabric upholstery benefits from spot cleaning and periodic vacuuming. The chaise sections may require more frequent attention due to their extra length and potential exposure to direct sunlight. 

Check the base feet regularly for wear and replace them as needed to prevent wobbling. The additional cushions in chaise sections may need more frequent rotation and support adjustment compared to standard seat cushions.
