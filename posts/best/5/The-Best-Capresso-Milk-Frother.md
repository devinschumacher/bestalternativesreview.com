### What types of milk frothers does Capresso offer?

Capresso offers both countertop and portable milk frothers. The countertop models include the popular Capresso Impromptu and Capresso MochaSteam, while the portable option is the Capresso Travel MochaSteam. 

Each model features steam technology for frothing milk, heating capabilities for coffee, and precise temperature control for optimal results. The main difference is the portability of the travel model, making it suitable for home or office use while traveling. 


### How do I use a Capresso milk frother?

Fill the frother with milk to the max line and insert the steam wand into a jug of cold milk. Turn the machine on and move the wand up and down through the milk until it reaches your desired consistency. For heating coffee, simply fill the steam wand with hot coffee and turn it on for a few seconds. 

After use, detach the steam wand, clean it immediately, and empty the milk reservoir. Regular maintenance includes descaling the machine every 2-3 months to prevent mineral buildup and maintain performance. 

![capresso-milk-frother-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/capresso-milk-frother-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How long does it take for a Capresso milk frother to heat milk?

The heating time depends on the starting temperature of the milk and the amount used. For the Capresso Impromptu and MochaSteam, it typically takes 20-30 seconds to heat milk to the optimal brewing temperature for coffee, which is around 160-170°F (71-77°C). 

For the Travel MochaSteam, the heating process is slightly faster due to its compact design, usually completing in 15-20 seconds for the same temperature range. The machine's precise thermostat ensures consistent results regardless of the starting temperature. 


### What is the capacity of Capresso milk frothers?

The Capresso Impromptu and MochaSteam have a milk capacity of 16 ounces (473 ml) for frothing and 8 ounces (237 ml) for coffee heating. The Travel MochaSteam has a smaller capacity of 9 ounces (260 ml) due to its portable design. 

These capacities are sufficient for single servings of coffee or tea, making them ideal for home use or travel. The smaller volume in the portable model ensures quick heating and frothing, while the larger capacity of the countertop models allows for versatility in brewing different coffee and tea drinks.

### Can I use any type of milk in a Capresso milk frother?

While Capresso milk frothers are compatible with all types of milk, the taste and texture may vary. Whole milk produces creamy, rich foam, while milk alternatives like almond or soy milk work well in the machine but will affect the foam's taste and consistency. 

When using non-dairy milk alternatives, start with a 1:1 ratio of alternative milk to regular milk to maintain the desired foam consistency. The frothers are compatible with both refrigerated and shelf-stable plant-based milk products. 


### How do I maintain and clean my Capresso milk frother?

Clean the machine immediately after each use by removing and cleaning the steam wand. For the milk reservoir and base, wipe them down with warm water and mild soap. Avoid getting water inside the motor area, as it is not dishwasher safe. 

Descaling the machine every 2-3 months removes mineral buildup and maintains optimal performance. To descale, fill the milk reservoir with a descaling solution according to the manufacturer's instructions, run it through a heating cycle, and rinse thoroughly with clean water.
