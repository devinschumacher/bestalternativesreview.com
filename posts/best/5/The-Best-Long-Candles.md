## Buyer's Guide

Long candles combine elegance with practicality, offering a dramatic focal point while providing plenty of light. When selecting long candles, several key factors influence their suitability for your space and needs. 


### Height Considerations

Height ranges from practical to grandiose, depending on the desired effect. Standard options are 12-18 inches, suitable for table centerpieces or shelf displays. For dramatic statements, consider candles 24 inches or taller, though taller candles need proper base support to prevent tipping. 

![Long-Candles-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Long-Candles-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Material and Construction

Materials like ceramic, glass, and stone offer both durability and visual interest. Consider the candle's weight and base design to ensure stability. Heavier materials provide better support but may be more fragile. Some materials, like metal, can get very hot during burning and should be handled with care. 


### Wick and Burn Characteristics

Long candles require special wicks designed to maintain a consistent flame. Look for candles with double or multiple wicks for larger sizes. Consider the burn time - standard candles burn at about 1 hour per inch. Factor this into your needs, as longer candles provide more ambient light but require careful placement to prevent wax runoff. 

![Long-Candles-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Long-Candles-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Maintenance and Safety

Regular cleaning and inspection of the candle and its base ensure safety and longevity. Some materials need more frequent cleaning than others. Always place candles on heat-resistant surfaces and keep them away from drafts, which can affect the flame and wax flow. Consider the ease of extinguishing - some candles feature built-in mechanisms for easy flame control. 


## FAQ

![Long-Candles-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Long-Candles-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What makes long candles unique?

Long candles, typically measuring between 10 and 20 inches, offer several advantages over shorter alternatives. They provide more burn time per candle, making them economical for scenting large spaces or creating extended ambiance. 

These candles use specialized wicks and wick designs optimized for longer lengths, ensuring even burning and minimizing tunneling. The increased surface area also allows for richer fragrance throw. 


### How do I maintain a long candle?

Proper maintenance is crucial for long candles to achieve the best performance. Always trim the wick to 1/4 inch before each use to prevent smoking and ensure clean burning. 

Allow the candle to burn until the wax pool reaches the edges of the container each time you light it. This "candle memory" helps establish an even burn pattern throughout the candle's life. 

![Long-Candles-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Long-Candles-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What's the best way to store long candles?

Store long candles in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat sources. This helps preserve the wick's integrity and prevents the wax from softening or deforming. 

Avoid stacking candles directly on top of each other, as this can cause uneven burning or damage to the container. Consider storing them upright in a box to protect the candles during transport or display. 


### Can I burn a long candle continuously?

It's generally not recommended to burn a long candle continuously for several hours at a time. Most candles are designed for regular, shorter burn sessions rather than extended periods of use. 

While some long candles can safely burn for 5-6 hours at a time, it's best to follow the manufacturer's guidelines and allow the candle to cool completely between uses to prevent overheating the container. 

![Long-Candles-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Long-Candles-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What kind of container do long candles use?

Long candles typically come in specialized containers designed to support the weight of the wax and accommodate the longer wick. These containers are often made from heat-resistant materials like glass or ceramic. 

The container should have a diameter slightly larger than the candle's widest point to allow for proper heat dispersion and prevent thermal stress. 


### What's the difference between long and short candles?

The primary distinction is their length, with long candles measuring 10-20 inches compared to shorter options. Longer candles offer greater burn time and better scent throw but may require more careful handling and storage. 

Shorter candles are more versatile for tabletop use and travel, while long candles excel in room scenting and decorative applications where extended burn time is beneficial.
