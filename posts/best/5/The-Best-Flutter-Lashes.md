## Buyer's Guide

Flutter lashes, designed to create a natural yet enhanced gaze, offer a versatile solution for those seeking subtle volume and curl without the bulk of traditional false lashes. Understanding the key aspects of flutter lashes will help you select the most suitable pair for your lashes and desired look. 


### Length and Curl

Flutter lashes typically range from 8mm to 14mm in length, with 10mm being a common standard. The curl should match your natural lash shape for a more natural appearance. Consider lashes with a slight reverse curl to help them lie flat against your natural lashes while providing lift and volume. 


### Curl Hold and Adhesion

Look for lashes with a strong adhesive that maintains curl without transferring to your natural lashes. Consider dual adhesive systems that offer initial strong hold followed by flexible adhesion. The lash band material also matters - silicone bands typically provide better curl hold than tape. 


### Application and Removal

Ease of application is crucial for flutter lashes. Opt for bands with built-in application tools or adhesive strips that prevent messy application. For removal, consider lashes with easy-to-use removal solutions that prevent residue and maintain lash health. Always remove with care to avoid pulling on natural lashes. 


### Skin Compatibility and Allergies

Check the lash material for skin compatibility - silicone and medical-grade adhesives are generally hypoallergenic. Perform patch tests on new products and start with short application times to monitor skin reaction. If you have sensitive eyes or allergies, look for products specifically marketed as hypoallergenic. 


## FAQ


### What are Flutter Lashes?

Flutter Lashes are small, decorative additions to doll or action figure hair that create a fluttering effect when the character moves. These lightweight attachments enhance the realism and play value of toys featuring human hair. 

Each Flutter Lash is designed to clip onto existing hair pieces, maintaining the doll's hairstyle while introducing subtle movement. They come in various lengths and styles to match different hair types and lengths. 


### How do Flutter Lashes work?

The base of each Flutter Lash features a clip mechanism that securely attaches to pre-existing hair extensions. When the doll or action figure moves, the lightweight lashes catch in the breeze, producing a realistic fluttering effect. 

These lashes work best with hair pieces that have some texture or movement, as smooth strands may not generate enough air resistance to create an noticeable fluttering effect. 


### What hair types are Flutter Lashes suitable for?

Flutter Lashes work well with most hair types, including wigs, extensions, and natural hair. The clips attach to any hair piece with small diameter, typically between 0.125 to 0.25 inches, making them compatible with various hair thicknesses. 

For best results, hair should be clean and free of products that might interfere with the clip mechanism. Hair that's too greasy or has heavy styling products may affect the attachment and movement of the lashes. 


### How do you install Flutter Lashes?

Installation is simple: detach the clip from its packaging and use the included instructions to attach it to your doll's hair. Clips work best on the outer edges of hair pieces or areas with natural movement. 

Adjust the lashes to your desired position, ensuring they sit flush with the hair for a natural look. Each clip can support multiple lashes, allowing you to customize the amount of movement for different hairstyles. 


### How long do Flutter Lashes last?

With proper care, Flutter Lashes can last several months to a year, depending on usage and maintenance. Regular cleaning with mild soap and water helps preserve the clips and maintain their effectiveness. 

When not in use, store the lashes in their original packaging or a similar protective container to prevent tangling and maintain their shape. Always dry them completely before storing to prevent mold and mildew growth. 


### Are Flutter Lashes safe for children?

Yes, Flutter Lashes are designed for safe use by children and adults. The clips are made from non-toxic materials and are free from small parts that could pose a choking hazard. 

As with any hair modification, supervise young children while they're applying Flutter Lashes to ensure proper clip placement and to prevent tangling. Regularly check the clips for wear and replace if they show signs of damage or loose attachment.
