### Blade Design and Functionality

Pocket knives from Camillus feature versatile blade designs, including fixed blades and locking mechanisms.

The blade's thickness affects both cutting capacity and durability, with thicker blades providing more strength at the cost of flexibility.

The handle's construction, whether through interference fit, bolsters, or thumb rests, significantly impacts user comfort and control during use. 


### Closure Mechanisms

From simple push-button mechanisms to more complex lockbacks, the closure system affects both usability and safety.

### Size and Weight Considerations

Length considerations balance accessibility for pocket carry with blade working space; shorter knives are easier to carry daily, while longer blades provide more substantial cutting capacity. 


## FAQ

![Camillus-Pocket-Knife-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Camillus-Pocket-Knife-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What makes Camillus pocket knives unique?

These knives combine military-grade durability with practical everyday features. The high-carbon steel blades resist corrosion and maintain sharpness, while the ergonomic handles offer secure grip in any condition. 

Each knife is crafted in the USA using time-tested designs that balance weight, balance, and cutting performance. From tactical models to utility knives, Camillus offers options for every user preference. 


### What blade sizes are available?

Most Camillus pocket knives feature 2.5 to 3.5-inch folding blades, though some specialized models offer shorter or longer options. The fixed blade versions typically range from 3 to 4.5 inches. 

Exact dimensions vary by model, so check the specific product listing for blade length. This information is crucial for determining suitability based on intended use and local regulations. 

![Camillus-Pocket-Knife-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Camillus-Pocket-Knife-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do I maintain my new Camillus knife?

Regularly clean the blade with mild soap and water, then dry completely to prevent rust. Apply a thin layer of lubricant to the pivot point and blade spring every six months for optimal performance. 

Store the knife blade-up in its sheath when not in use. This protects the edge and keeps the blade aligned properly. For extra protection, apply a light coat of oil to the blade when the knife is dry. 


### Which models are best for outdoor use?

The Camillus Falcon, Pathfinder, and Mariner series are highly rated for outdoor chores like camping, hunting, and fishing. These models feature durable blades, convenient quick-release sheaths, and versatile edge designs. 

For serious outdoor enthusiasts, consider the Marine Survival Knife or any of the multi-tool models that combine a primary blade with additional implements like pliers or scissors. 

![Camillus-Pocket-Knife-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Camillus-Pocket-Knife-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Are Camillus knives legal to carry everywhere?

While the basic folding models are usually legal in most locations, check local laws before carrying knives with locking blades or those over 3 inches in length. Many states require them to be sheathed when carried openly. 

To stay compliant, opt for the folder models and ensure your blade stays under 3 inches when locked. Always check specific regulations for your destination, as laws can vary significantly between cities and states. 


### How much do Camillus pocket knives typically cost?

The budget-friendly option, like the basic Folding Knife, starts around $25. Higher-end models with specialized features or premium materials can range from $50 to $150 depending on the included accessories and craftsmanship. 

These prices reflect the combination of premium materials and American-made construction that Camillus is known for. While not the least expensive pocket knives available, they represent excellent value for the quality and durability they provide.
