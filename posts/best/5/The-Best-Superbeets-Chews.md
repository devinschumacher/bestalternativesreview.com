### Key Ingredients

Superbeets Chews typically contain beetroot extract as their primary active ingredient. They may also include natural flavors, sweeteners like xylitol or erythritol, and other ingredients to enhance flavor and texture. High-quality products will clearly list all components on their labels. 


### Dosage and Consumption

Most Superbeets Chews come in standardized dosages, with recommended daily intake usually printed on the packaging. These typically provide around 1500 mg of beetroot extract, equivalent to about 1 cup of fresh beetroot. Consistency in consumption helps maintain steady nutrient levels.

## FAQ


### What are Superbeets Chews?

Superbeets Chews are a type of beet-based energy chew designed for athletes and active individuals. These chews are made from pure beet juice concentrate, containing no artificial ingredients, preservatives, or added sugars. 

The chews come in three varieties - Beet Red, Beet Black, and Beet Gold, each offering a unique flavor profile while delivering the same performance benefits. Each serving provides a natural energy boost and improved endurance through enhanced oxygen uptake and reduced muscle fatigue. 


### How do Superbeets Chews improve performance?

The primary ingredient in Superbeets Chews is nitric oxide boosting inorganic nitrates derived from beet juice. These nitrates help dilate blood vessels, improving oxygen and nutrient delivery to muscles during exercise. The result is increased stamina and reduced perceived exertion. 

Research has shown that nitrate-rich foods like beets can improve aerobic performance by 2-3% when consumed before exercise. Superbeets Chews provide a convenient way to consume this performance-boosting compound without the need for fresh beets or beet juice. 


### How should I take Superbeets Chews?

Superbeets Chews are designed for optimal absorption when taken 30-60 minutes before exercise. Dissolve one chew in your mouth or add it to water or a sports drink. The chews should be consumed with adequate liquid to facilitate absorption and prevent gastrointestinal discomfort. 

For best results, maintain proper hydration and follow the recommended serving size of one chew per serving. If you are on medication that interacts with nitrates, consult your healthcare provider before use. 


### Are Superbeets Chews suitable for everyone?

Superbeets Chews are generally safe for most individuals, but some considerations apply. People with stomach sensitivities may experience mild digestive upset when first introducing the product. Starting with a single chew and increasing gradually can help with tolerance. 

Avoid taking Superbeets Chews if you have anemia, iron deficiency, or are taking medications that interact with nitrates. If you have a medical condition or take medication, check with your healthcare provider before using these chews. 


### Can Superbeets Chews be used during competition?

Yes, Superbeets Chews are suitable for competition use. The natural ingredients and quick-acting formula make them ideal for last-minute energy support before events. They are free from banned substances, so you can use them without penalty in sports with drug testing. 

Always check your specific sport's regulations regarding nutritional supplements. For professional athletes, maintain proper documentation and record-keeping as required by your governing body. 


### How long do Superbeets Chews last?

Each package of Superbeets Chews contains 20 individual servings. The chews have a shelf life of 24 months from the date of manufacture when stored properly in a cool, dry place. The packaging includes a child-resistant closure to maintain freshness. 

To preserve quality and efficacy, keep the chews away from direct sunlight and moisture. If you notice any changes in color, texture, or smell, discontinue use and consult the manufacturer for guidance.
