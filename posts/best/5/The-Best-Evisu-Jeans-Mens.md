## FAQ


### What makes Evisu Jeans different from other men's jeans?

Evisu Jeans stands out through its distinctive blend of Japanese craftsmanship and streetwear influence. These jeans combine traditional sewing techniques with modern designs, featuring unique details like hand-painted graphics and premium fabric options. 

The brand's commitment to quality is evident in every pair, from the premium denim used to the meticulous attention to detail in each seam and stitch. 


### Are Evisu Jeans suitable for both casual and formal occasions?

While Evisu's streetwear aesthetic might make them appear more casual, these jeans are versatile enough to pair with dress shirts for both business and semi-formal events. The brand's classic styles work particularly well in transitional seasons when you want a smart-casual look. 

The key is to choose the right fit and wash: a slim fit with a dark wash will be more appropriate for formal occasions, while a relaxed fit in a lighter wash works better for casual settings. 


### What makes Evisu's blue washes so distinctive?

Evisu's signature "Evisu Wash" process creates blue jeans with a vintage, slightly faded appearance that develops over time. This unique wash is achieved through a combination of water temperature control and precise dye application during the manufacturing process. 

Each pair develops differently when washed, creating a one-of-a-kind look that evolves as you wear them - some might develop more fading on the knees, while others might show more at the cuffs. 


### How do I care for Evisu jeans to maintain their quality?

To keep your Evisu jeans looking their best, follow these care instructions: air dry rather than using a dryer, use a mild detergent when washing, and resist the urge to use bleach or harsh chemicals. Storing them in a breathable bag or on a hanger can also help maintain their shape and quality. 

For detailed care instructions specific to your pair, check the care label inside the waistband - Evisu may provide specific guidance based on the construction and materials used in your particular style. 


### What sizes do Evisu jeans come in?

Evisu offers a range of fits including slim, regular, and relaxed styles, with sizes typically running from small to 3XL. However, the exact sizing can vary by style, so it's important to check the specific style guide for measurements and fit recommendations. 

Many styles offer extended sizing options, so if your size isn't listed, it's worth checking back or contacting customer service for availability. 


### How do Evisu prices compare to other premium denim brands?

While Evisu positions itself as a premium brand, its pricing typically falls between mid-range and high-end denim options. A pair of Evisu jeans usually costs between $150 and $250, depending on the style and wash. 

To put this in perspective, you'll find similar pricing structures when comparing to brands like Jacob & Co. , Kuroi, or Burch amp; King - all of which target the same demographic of fashion-conscious men seeking quality denim.
