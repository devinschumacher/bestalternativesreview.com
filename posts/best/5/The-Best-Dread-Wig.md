## Buyer's Guide

A dread wig is a versatile styling option for those who love the look of natural dreads but prefer the convenience of wearing them. These synthetic hairpieces offer the freedom to change styles and lengths while maintaining the texture signature of real dreadlocks. When selecting a dread wig, consider several key factors to ensure you choose one that meets your styling needs and quality expectations. 


### Material Quality

Synthetic fibers are the most common material for dread wigs, offering durability and affordability. Higher-quality synthetic wigs use materials like Heatmaxx or Rexton, which resist tangling and maintain shape better than standard polyester or acrylic. For those who style their wigs frequently with heat tools, opting for a Heatmaxx or Rexton wig can extend its lifespan and maintain its texture. 


### Length and Style Options

Dread wigs are available in various lengths, from short styles to shoulder-length cuts. Consider how long you want your styled hair to appear, keeping in mind that the natural length of your actual hair will affect the final look. Additionally, check if the wig offers multiple sectioning points to create the traditional dreadlock style or if it's already pre-styled with faux locs. 


### Size and Fit

Most dread wigs come in one-size-fits-most designs that use an elastic band or Velcro to secure the style. However, if you have an unusually shaped head or thinning hair, consider a wig with adjustable straps or a secure underband for better stability. The band should sit comfortably just above the ears without causing pressure or discomfort. 


### Maintenance Requirements

Proper maintenance keeps your dread wig looking its best. Synthetic dread wigs require regular cleaning with a damp cloth and specialized dread wig shampoo. The elastic bands need replacement approximately every three months to prevent tangling and maintain hygiene. Consider storing the wig in a clean, breathable bag when not in use to protect its shape and quality. 


## FAQ


### What exactly is a dread wig?

A dread wig is a type of synthetic or human hair wig that is designed to mimic the natural growth patterns and texture of dreadlocks. Unlike traditional wigs, which have straight or curly hair, dread wigs feature individual hair strands that are twisted and braided to create a dreadlock-like appearance. 

These wigs are popular among individuals who have real dreadlocks but want to change their hairstyle temporarily, or those who want to achieve the look without the maintenance required for natural dreadlocks. 


### How long do dread wigs typically last?

With proper care, a quality dread wig can last anywhere from 1 to 3 years. This lifespan depends on several factors, including the material (synthetic vs. human hair), how often it's worn, and how well it's maintained. 

Proper care involves regular cleaning to prevent matting, avoiding harsh chemicals, and storing the wig properly when not in use to prevent tangling and damage. 


### Can you style dread wigs like real dreadlocks?

While you can style a dread wig similar to how you would style real dreadlocks, keep in mind that synthetic wigs may not hold styling products as effectively as human hair. Common styles include braided updos, twists, and natural-looking dreadlock arrangements. 

A human hair dread wig will style more like natural dreadlocks and can be manipulated more easily, while synthetic wigs generally require less maintenance but may not respond as predictably to styling tools. 


### What's the difference between synthetic and human hair dread wigs?

Synthetic dread wigs are made from artificial fibers and typically cost less than human hair wigs. They're generally easier to maintain, requiring minimal care and styling products. 

Human hair dread wigs are made from real hair, which gives them a more natural appearance and texture. They're usually more expensive but last longer and can be styled similarly to natural dreadlocks. 


### How do you care for a dread wig?

Regular grooming is essential for maintaining a dread wig. Use a wide-tooth comb or dread comb to gently detangle the hair weekly, and wash the wig every 1-2 weeks with a mild shampoo specifically designed for synthetic or human hair. 

Avoid using heat styling tools, harsh chemicals, or tight hairstyles that can damage the individual hair strands. When not in use, store the wig in a breathable bag to prevent matting and tangling. 


### Are dread wigs comfortable to wear?

Most dread wigs are designed for comfort, with padded caps that distribute weight evenly and prevent pressure points. Synthetic wigs generally have built-in padding and are lightweight, while human hair wigs may require additional padding or a separate liner for extended wear. 

Some people with sensitive scalps may experience discomfort from the rubber bands or clips used to secure dread wigs. Consider choosing a wig with adjustable bands or trying different styles to find what works best for you.
