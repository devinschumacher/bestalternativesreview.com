## Buyer's Guide

A crucial component of playing a Paladin in Dungeons & Dragons 5e, spells enable these noble warriors to channel divine power in various ways. Understanding the strengths and limitations of different spell selections can significantly impact your character's effectiveness and versatility. 


### Spell Selection Considerations

When choosing Paladin spells, consider your character's playstyle and campaign goals. For frontline defenders, spells like Shield of Faith and Lay on Hands enhance survivability and healing capabilities. Offensively-minded Paladins can excel with spells like Zone of Truth and Divine Smite, which combine martial prowess with magical effects. 


### Spell Casting Methods

Paladins can cast spells through three primary methods: spell slots, divine smite, and paladin features. Understanding how these systems interact is crucial for efficient spell selection. For example, using a spell slot to cast Shield of Faith allows you to use it as an action, while divine smite requires no spell slot but deals less damage. 


### Spell Preparation and Usage

Paladins prepare a certain number of spells in advance and can swap them daily. Effective spell management involves preparing versatile combinations that balance offensive, defensive, and utility capabilities. Consider preparing spells that complement your character's core abilities and campaign needs. 


### Spell Scaling and Character Growth

As your Paladin grows in power, your spell choices should adapt to maintain relevance. Higher-level spells offer greater versatility but may become less practical if your party has other spellcasters. Regularly reassess your spell selection to ensure it scales effectively with your character's growth and the evolving nature of your campaign. 


## FAQ


### What is the difference between Paladin spells in 5e and other spellcasting classes?

Paladins in Dungeons & Dragons 5e have a unique selection of spells that reflect their divine or heroic nature. Unlike many other spellcasting classes, their spell list focuses on healing, protection, and divine punishment, providing versatile support and battlefield control options. 

The paladin's class abilities and spell selection work together to create a character that can excel in both melee combat and spellcasting, making them a valuable addition to most parties. 


### How do Paladins acquire their spells?

At each spellcasting level, paladins learn new spells from their spellbook, which they create by selecting spells from the paladin spell list during character creation. They can also add new spells to their spellbook through the Artifice feat or other means, though they must follow the standard rules for adding spells to their book. 

Paladins typically spend time preparing their spells using the Ritual Casting feature at certain levels, allowing them to cast these spells without expending spell slots. 


### At what levels do Paladins gain access to new spells?

Paladins gain access to new spells at specific levels. The basic paladin spell list starts at 1st level, with additional spells added at 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 9th, and 17th levels. These levels represent key milestones in a paladin's spiritual and martial development. 

Through multiclassing or prestige class options, paladins may gain access to even more spells at later levels, providing them with a robust toolkit for any adventure. 


### Can Paladins cast spells from other classes?

Paladins can learn and cast spells from other classes through various means, including multiclassing or feat selection. While they must follow the standard rules for cross-class spellcasting, this versatility allows them to expand their spell selection beyond the paladin spell list. 

Some prestige classes specifically enhance a paladin's ability to cast spells from other classes, while feats like Artificer or Divine Power allow them to add additional spells to their list. 


### How does Alignment affect a Paladin's spellcasting?

Paladins' access to spells is directly tied to their alignment. A paladin must follow their god's tenets to maintain their spellcasting abilities. If a paladin's actions contradict their deity's principles, they may lose their ability to cast spells, as detailed in the Paladin subclass rules. 

The paladin's alignment also influences their spell selection, with some spells requiring a specific alignment alignment to cast. 


### Can Paladins still cast spells when under the effect of Divine Sense or Devotion?

In most cases, a paladin's spellcasting is unaffected by Divine Sense or Devotion, as these features enhance their ability to sense hostile creatures and maintain divine connections. The paladin's spellcasting remains functional unless specifically restricted by their subclass rules or other effects. 

For feats and abilities that require the paladin to maintain their alignment focus, such as Divine Smite, the ability to cast spells is not typically impacted by these features, though the paladin must still maintain their spiritual connection to their deity.
