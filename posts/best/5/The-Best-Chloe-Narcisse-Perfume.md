## Buyer's Guide

The Chloe Narcisse perfume blend captures the essence of spring with its fresh, floral notes. When selecting a perfume, consider factors like scent strength, longevity, and your personal fragrance preferences. The top notes typically influence immediate perception, while the heart notes form the core fragrance profile. 


### Top Notes

The top notes are the first scents that greet you and are crucial for initial appeal. For a perfume like Narcisse, these might include bergamot, lemon, or rose petals. These volatile compounds evaporate quickly, so they set the immediate tone.

### Heart Notes

The heart notes emerge after the top notes dissipate and form the main scent character. These middle-layer scents are usually more stable and can include floral elements, spices, or green accords. The heart notes define the perfume's character and typically last several hours. 


### Base Notes

The base notes provide depth and longevity to the fragrance, developing after the top and heart notes have faded. Common base notes include vanilla, amber, patchouli, or woody scents. These elements help the perfume dry down and can influence its projection and sillage (trail left on clothing).

### Personal Considerations

Scent compatibility varies between individuals due to differences in skin chemistry and body temperature. Testing perfumes for at least 30 minutes is advisable to judge longevity and personal suitability. Consider the occasion and environment where you'll wear the perfume, as some scents may be more appropriate for daytime or formal events.

### What is the alcohol content?

Chloe Narcisse contains 99% alcohol by volume, which helps the fragrance blend well with skin oils and evaporates quickly, allowing the scent to develop naturally. 

High alcohol content also extends the spray range, making it easy to apply a fine mist that diffuses evenly. 


### Is Chloe Narcisse suitable for all skin types?

### What packaging design elements are notable?

The bottle design features a sleek, minimalist glass container with a refined silver cap. The sleek lines and understated elegance complement the fragrance's modern floral profile. 

The cap design includes a small, decorative element that adds detail without overwhelming the overall simplicity of the bottle. 


### How should the fragrance be applied?

Chloe Narcisse works best when applied to pulse points like the wrists, neck, and behind the ears. The warmth of these areas helps the fragrance blend with skin oils and intensifies its sillage. 

A light application of the fragrance mist creates a subtle, lingering presence, while adding a small amount directly to pulse points allows the scent to develop more fully.
