## FAQ


### What is a Nama Juicer?

A Nama juicer is a specialized appliance designed for extracting juice from fresh fruits and vegetables. Unlike traditional centrifugal juicers, Nama juicers use a slow-mastication method that minimizes oxidation and heat exposure, preserving more nutrients and flavor in the final product. 

These juicers typically feature a single gear or auger that gently crushes and squeezes produce, separating the juice from pulp and solids. The process results in a smoother juice with fewer pulp particles compared to other types of juicers. 


### How does a Nama juicer work?

To operate a Nama juicer, you load whole fruits and vegetables into the feed chute, where they encounter a slow-moving auger or single cutting blade. The auger slowly grinds and squeezes the produce, extracting juice while keeping pulp and fiber intact. 

Once the juicing process is complete, the pulp collects in a separate container for easy disposal or use in baking and cooking. The extracted juice flows through a separate channel into a collection container for immediate consumption or storage. 


### What are the benefits of Nama juicing?

Nama juicers preserve enzymes and antioxidants better than conventional juicers by operating at slower speeds and generating less heat. This results in a more nutritious and flavorful juice with potentially longer shelf life. 

These juicers also produce less heat during operation, which helps maintain the temperature of the extracted juice, making it ideal for serving immediately after juicing. 


### What types of fruits and vegetables work best with Nama juicers?

Most fruits and vegetables suitable for conventional juicing can be processed in a Nama juicer. Particularly effective ingredients include leafy greens like spinach and kale, as well as root vegetables like carrots and beets. 

Water-rich fruits like cucumber and celery work well, as do softer fruits like berries and peaches. Firm fruits like apples and pears also yield good results with this juicing method. 


### How do I maintain a Nama juicer?

Regular cleaning is essential to maintain hygiene and optimal performance. After each use, disassemble the juicer and wash all parts with warm water and mild detergent. The auger and cutting blades should be cleaned thoroughly to prevent residue buildup. 

Store the juicer in a clean, dry place when not in use. Replace worn parts according to the manufacturer's recommendations to ensure proper functioning and extended equipment life. 


### What maintenance requirements are there for Nama juicers?

Most Nama juicers need routine cleaning after every use, including the feed chute, collection container, and auger. The cutting blade should be cleaned thoroughly to prevent residue buildup and maintain cutting efficiency. 

Regular maintenance includes checking for proper lubrication of moving parts, ensuring seals are intact, and verifying that all connectors and attachments fit securely. Refer to the manufacturer's guidelines for specific maintenance requirements.
