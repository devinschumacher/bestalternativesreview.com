Clean your Clubmaster glasses daily with a soft, lint-free cloth to remove fingerprints and dust. For deeper cleaning, use mild soap and water, avoiding harsh detergents. 

Store your glasses in a soft case when not in use to protect the frames and lenses. Handle them by the temples rather than the lenses to prevent scratches and maintain their shape.
