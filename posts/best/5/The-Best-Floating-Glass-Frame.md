## Buyer's Guide

A floating glass frame creates a sleek, modern display for photos, artwork, or mirrors. The key is achieving that "floating" effect where the glass appears unsecured, creating visual depth. Here's what to consider when selecting a floating glass frame. 


### Size and Proportion

The frame's dimensions should complement, not overwhelm, the piece it's displaying. Common frame-to-content ratios range from 1:1 to 2:3. Consider the room's size and ceiling height - smaller frames work better in taller spaces to maintain visual balance. 


### Material Quality

Use durable materials that won't deform over time. Aluminum frames resist warping but can scratch easily. Stainless steel offers superior corrosion resistance but is heavier. Consider the frame's finish: anodized aluminum provides excellent durability, while painted finishes may chip or peel. 


### Securing Mechanism

A secure mounting system prevents glass from shifting or falling. Standard options include hidden clips or adjustable tension bars. For extra stability, look for frames with multiple mounting points or those rated for heavier glass. 


### Style and Aesthetics

The frame's profile and finish should match your room's style. Thin profiles create a more modern look, while sculptural frames add visual interest. Consider whether you prefer a visible frame or one that's nearly invisible against the glass. 


## FAQ


### What is a floating glass frame?

A floating glass frame is a specialized mounting technique where a piece of glass is suspended in mid-air, creating the illusion that it's "floating" within its frame. This effect is achieved by securely mounting the glass without visible supports in one or more of its corners. 

The glass appears to hover thanks to precise measurements and hidden support mechanisms. This modern framing method has become popular for displaying photos, artwork, and small objects, offering a clean and minimalist aesthetic. 


### What types of glass can be used in floating frames?

Regular glass is the most common material, typically available in standard thicknesses of 1/8", 1/4", and 3/8". Many options exist for customization, including tempered glass for added safety and decorative glass with etched or colored patterns. 

For an industrial look, fire-rated glass or bulletproof glass can be used, though these options require specialized installation techniques and may be more expensive. 


### How thick should the frame be for a floating glass piece?

Thicker frames provide more stability and are recommended for larger pieces or heavier glass. A minimum frame thickness of 2 inches is common for standard glass installations. 

Custom requirements may vary based on glass thickness and the specific mounting technique employed. Heavy-duty frames may need reinforcement for extra support. 


### What mounting techniques are used in floating glass frames?

Common techniques include clips that rest on the glass edge, magnetic adhesion for certain glass types, and hidden supports in the frame that secure the glass through proprietary mechanisms. 

Each technique requires specific considerations for glass thickness and frame materials to ensure both stability and aesthetic appeal. 


### How are floating glass frames maintained?

Regular maintenance involves cleaning the glass and frame with appropriate glass cleaners and soft cloths to prevent scratches and maintain the frame's condition. 

If the frame incorporates LED lighting, it should be powered off during cleaning to avoid damaging electronic components. Deep cleaning might require professional assistance, especially for complex frame designs. 


### What's the difference between a floating frame and a standard frame?

A floating frame suspends the glass without visible support, creating an architectural display effect. Standard frames typically secure the glass using visible mounting hardware or supporting structures. 

Standard frames offer more variations in design and mounting options, suitable for a wide range of glass types and thicknesses. Floating frames are ideal for modern, minimalist designs where exposed glass is the primary focus.
