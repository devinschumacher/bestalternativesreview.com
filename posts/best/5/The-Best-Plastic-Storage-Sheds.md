## Buyer's Guide

Plastic storage sheds offer a practical solution for organizing outdoor storage while keeping your items protected from the elements. These lightweight structures come in various sizes and styles, making them suitable for different needs and spaces. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select a shed that meets your storage requirements while withstanding the demands of outdoor use. 


### Size and Capacity

Measure the available space where you plan to install the shed and consider your storage needs. Common sizes range from 4x4 feet to 12x12 feet. The capacity is typically measured in cubic feet, which you can calculate by multiplying length x width x height. Factor in the weight and volume of your intended storage items to ensure the shed's capacity matches your needs. 


### Metal vs. Plastic Construction

Most plastic storage sheds use high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) for their walls and roof. HDPE offers better UV resistance and durability but can be heavier. PVC is more lightweight and flexible but may yellow over time. Consider the trade-offs between durability, weight, and appearance when choosing the construction material. 


### Roof Design and Drainage

Effective roof design is crucial for shedding water and preventing leaks. Look for sheds with a pitched roof (angled at 10-20 degrees) and proper gutters and downspouts. The pitch helps water run off, while gutters direct it away from the building's base. The ridge height should be at least 24 inches to ensure adequate water flow and prevent accumulation. 


### Door and Window Options

The entrance door size and design significantly impact access and ventilation. Standard doors range from 72 to 96 inches wide, with double doors available for larger spaces. Consider the number of doors and their placement (center or side) based on your storage needs and ease of access. Windows provide natural light and improve ventilation, but they increase the risk of breakage. Choose security features like reinforced frames and storm windows if privacy and protection are concerns. 


## FAQ


### What are plastic storage sheds used for?

Plastic storage sheds are versatile structures used to store all sorts of items, from seasonal decor and yard games to lawn mowers and garden equipment. These sheds protect your belongings from the elements while keeping them organized and out of the way. 

They're also great for crafting, painting, or other hobbies that generate a lot of supplies, keeping your workshop clean and tidy. Many models feature built-in shelving and workbenches to help you make the most of the storage space available. 


### How do plastic storage sheds compare to wood ones?

Plastic storage sheds offer several advantages over wood models. They're more resistant to rot, termites, and moisture damage, requiring less maintenance and cleaning. When properly cared for, plastic sheds can last just as long as wooden ones. 

The primary tradeoff is cost – plastic sheds tend to be more affordable upfront. While they might cost less to purchase, the reduced maintenance and longevity can make plastic a more economical choice over time. 


### What size plastic storage shed should I get?

The right storage shed size depends on your specific needs. For small to medium items like tools and sports equipment, a shed between 6x6 and 8x8 feet works well. This size typically runs between $300-500. 

Larger sheds measuring 10x10 feet or more are suitable for bigger items like lawn mowers and seasonal decor. Premium models in this range start around $600-800, with custom options available for $1,000 or more. 


### Do plastic storage sheds come with locks?

Most plastic storage sheds include basic locks as standard features. Entry points like doors and windows typically have padlocking systems, while some premium models offer double-locking mechanisms for extra security. 

Entry-level sheds may only include basic padlocks, while higher-end models feature reinforced frames and multiple lock points. Consider upgrading to a security package if you need enhanced protection for valuable items. 


### What's the difference between indoor and outdoor storage?

Indoor storage solutions like garage storage units or wall-mounted shelves are best for items that need consistent temperature and humidity control. They're protected from the elements but require regular cleaning and maintenance. 

Outdoor plastic storage sheds keep items dry and dust-free while protecting them from harsh weather. They're ideal for tools, equipment, and seasonal decorations that need occasional exposure to the elements for maintenance or inspection. 


### How long do plastic storage sheds last?

With proper care, plastic storage sheds can last 10-15 years. This durability is comparable to entry-level wooden sheds, which typically last 12-15 years when protected from harsh weather conditions. 

The longevity of your shed depends heavily on maintenance practices. Regular cleaning, inspection for damage, and proper sealing against moisture will significantly extend its usable life. Store heavy items on lower shelves to prevent stress on the structure.
