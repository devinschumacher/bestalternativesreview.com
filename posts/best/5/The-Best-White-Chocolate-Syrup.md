## FAQ


### What is white chocolate syrup?

White chocolate syrup is a confectionery product that combines white chocolate with a sweetened liquid base. It typically contains cocoa butter, milk solids, sugar, and other flavorings to create a rich, creamy consistency. 

Unlike traditional dark chocolate syrup, which contains cocoa solids, white chocolate syrup has no added cocoa and presents a subtle, milkier flavor profile. 


### What are the main ingredients in white chocolate syrup?

The primary ingredients are cocoa butter, milk solids, sugar, and vanilla extract. Some premium products may include additional flavorings like almond or hazelnut. 

It's important to note that white chocolate syrup does not contain cocoa solids, distinguishing it from other chocolate-based syrups. 


### How is white chocolate syrup made?

Manufacturers blend cocoa butter, milk solids, sugar, and flavorings to create a smooth, pourable base. This mixture is then heated, emulsified, and homogenized to develop a creamy texture. 

Premium products might undergo additional processes like pasteurization and filtration to ensure consistency and shelf stability. 


### What foods pair well with white chocolate syrup?

It's ideal for topping pancakes, waffles, and French toast, providing a rich, creamy sweetener. The syrup also works well with hot or cold coffee beverages. 

Some creative uses include drizzling it over ice cream, mixing it into whipped cream, or using it as a baking ingredient in chocolate cake recipes. 


### How long does white chocolate syrup last?

When unopened, it typically has a shelf life of 12-18 months from the manufacturing date. Once opened, it should be used within 3-6 months for best quality. 

Store it in the refrigerator to prolong its shelf life, ensuring the container remains sealed and free from contamination. 


### Are there any health considerations?

White chocolate syrup is high in sugar and calories due to its chocolate and milk content. It's best used as an occasional sweet treat rather than a regular part of your diet. 

Some individuals may experience digestive issues from the milk solids, particularly those with lactose intolerance or dairy sensitivities.
