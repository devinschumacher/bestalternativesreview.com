## Buyer's Guide

Choosing the right entryway bench with cushion can transform your indoor welcome zone into a practical and inviting space. This guide walks you through the key features and considerations to help you select the perfect bench for your home. 


### Size and Space Requirements

Measure your entrance area to determine the appropriate bench dimensions. Consider the width needed for seating plus any additional space for storage or decorative elements. Bench lengths typically range from 40 to 96 inches, with widths between 18 and 24 inches. 

![Entryway-Bench-With-Cushion-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Entryway-Bench-With-Cushion-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Cushion and Seat Design

The cushion material should be durable and easy to maintain, with options for indoor or outdoor use depending on your space. Consider seat depth (usually 16-20 inches) and backrest height (12-20 inches). Some designs include built-in headrests or ergonomic lumbar support. 


### Storage Solutions

Bench seating often doubles as storage, with options ranging from simple hollow cores to multiple compartments. The storage capacity usually varies from 20 to 100 pounds, depending on the design. Popular types include seat-through storage, side panels, and twin-bench configurations.

### Style and Materials

Entryway benches come in various styles, from traditional wood to modern metal and sleek glass. Common materials include wood (pine, cedar, or engineered), metal (steel or aluminum), and synthetic polymer. The finish should match your existing decor, with options for matte, distressed, or painted surfaces. 


## FAQ

![Entryway-Bench-With-Cushion-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Entryway-Bench-With-Cushion-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What size benches are available?

Entryway benches can range from compact 30-inch models for small spaces to generous 72-inch versions for multi-purpose usage. Common sizes include 42 inches, perfect for regular use, and 60 inches, ideal for families or those who need extra storage. 

When measuring, consider your entryway's dimensions. Add a 12-inch overhang on each side for comfortable seating. Most benches use standard measurements for depth (18-24 inches), allowing easy placement against walls or in corners. 


### How do cushioned benches compare to those without cushions?

Cushioned benches offer superior comfort for regular use, making them ideal for drop zones where you plan to sit or store items frequently. The padding provides a softer surface that can protect clothing and belongings placed on top. 

Standard benches without cushions are often more affordable and lighter, making them easier to move if your needs change. They're practical for casual use or areas where you primarily need storage space. 

![Entryway-Bench-With-Cushion-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Entryway-Bench-With-Cushion-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can these benches be customized with different fabrics?

Most manufacturers offer at least two fabric options, including durable outdoor fabrics and premium indoor materials. Some brands allow custom fabric choices through their website or partnerships with specialty upholstery stores. 

When selecting fabric, consider your entryway's conditions. Indoor benches can use any material, while outdoor versions need weather-resistant options. Popular choices include polyester blends, outdoor-rated acrylics, and solution-dyed acrylics. 


### What style options are available for entryway benches?

Entryway benches come in a variety of styles, from minimalist wooden designs to ornate upholstered options. Common styles include farmhouse, industrial, shabby chic, and modern minimalist, making it easy to find a piece that matches your decor. 

Materials range from solid wood and metal to engineered wood and composite materials. Consider the finish: painted, distressed, lacquered, or natural wood tones. The seat can be upholstered, slipcovered, or feature a simple padded top. 

![Entryway-Bench-With-Cushion-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Entryway-Bench-With-Cushion-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How much storage space can these benches provide?

Entryway benches typically offer storage compartments ranging from 16 to 30 inches deep. Many models include open shelves above the seat for additional display or storage space. 

Standard storage depths of 18 inches provide ample space for boots, coats, and magazines. Deeper compartments of 24-30 inches are ideal for longer items like skis, surfboards, or bulkier coats. Most benches can hold 20-50 pounds per compartment. 


### Are these benches suitable for outdoor use?

Outdoor-rated entryway benches require weather-resistant materials and protective finishes. Look for solid wood, engineered wood, or weatherproof composites like recycled plastic lumber. 

Ensure the bench has a sealed surface that resists moisture, fading, and cracking. The cushions, if included, should be made from materials designed for outdoor use, such as heavy-duty polyester or weatherproof foam cores.
