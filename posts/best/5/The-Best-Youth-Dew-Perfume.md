## Buyer's Guide

When selecting a Youth Dew perfume, consider factors like scent intensity, longevity, and whether it contains natural or synthetic ingredients. The fragrance's composition typically includes top notes (initial scent), middle notes (heart of the fragrance), and base notes (enduring scent). 


### Top Notes

Top notes are the first scents you notice and usually last only a few minutes. They should be refreshing and pleasant to ensure you make a good first impression. 


### Middle Notes

Middle notes form the core of the fragrance and typically last 1-3 hours. These mid-level scents provide the character and lasting appeal of the perfume. 


### Base Notes

The base notes emerge about 30 minutes after application and can last several hours. They give the perfume its overall scent profile and contribute to its longevity. 


### Personalization

Consider your personal style and preferences when selecting Youth Dew. Some people prefer fresh, clean scents, while others enjoy more complex, layered fragrances. 


## FAQ


### What notes make up the Youth Dew perfume?

Like many modern fragrances, Youth Dew features a complex blend of scents. The top notes typically include fresh, zesty elements like bergamot and Mandarin orange, which create an uplifting opening to the fragrance. 

The heart notes often consist of floral and green accords, such as jasmine, geranium, and hints of cucumber. These middle notes provide the core scent profile that develops after the initial spritz. 


### How long does Youth Dew usually last?

Youth Dew has a moderate longevity profile for a modern fragrance, typically lasting 3-4 hours on the skin. After the initial burst of intensity, the scent usually evolves into a more subtle, lasting presence. 

Despite its moderate longevity, the fragrance tends to remain noticeable throughout the daytime, making it suitable for various occasions from casual outings to professional settings. 


### What type of alcohol is used in Youth Dew?

The primary alcohol used in Youth Dew is ethyl alcohol (also known as ethanol), which serves as the base for the fragrance's ingredients. This type of alcohol is commonly used in perfumery due to its quick-drying properties and good solvent characteristics. 

Small amounts of denatured alcohol may also be present in the formulation to prevent drinking and to comply with local regulations, though these components are typically non-perfumery in nature. 


### Does Youth Dew contain any animal-derived ingredients?

While many traditional perfumes contain animal-derived ingredients, Youth Dew is designed to be vegan-friendly. The fragrance formula avoids ingredients like musk, castoreum, and ambergris, opting instead for synthetic alternatives that mimic natural scents. 

This commitment to vegan-formula ingredients has helped the brand maintain its appeal to consumers who prefer products free from animal-derived substances. 


### What sizes are available for Youth Dew?

Youth Dew is available in several standard sizes, including 30ml travel sprays, 50ml sprays, and 100ml sprays. The brand also offers a 120ml glass bottle for its larger purchases, providing flexibility for different needs and budgets. 

Travel sizes are particularly useful for frequent reapplication throughout the day or when packing for travel, while larger bottles offer better value for daily use. 


### How should Youth Dew be stored?

To maintain the fragrance's quality, Youth Dew should be stored in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight and heat sources. Ideal storage conditions are between 60-75Â°F (15-24Â°C), with exposure to extreme temperatures potentially degrading the scent over time. 

The spray bottle should be kept upright when not in use to prevent leakage and ensure proper functioning. Regularly checking the spray mechanism and replacing the bottle before the expiration date of the fragrance contents is recommended for optimal performance.
