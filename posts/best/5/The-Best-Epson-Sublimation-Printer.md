## FAQ


### What is a sublimation printer?

A sublimation printer uses heat to fuse dyes permanently into the surface of specially treated materials. This process creates vibrant, professional-quality prints that become part of the substrate rather than sitting on top of it. 

These printers are commonly used for creating custom apparel, phone cases, decals, and other decorative items. The resulting prints have excellent durability and resistance to fading, water, and chemicals. 


### What materials can I print on with an Epson sublimation printer?

Epson sublimation printers work with a variety of materials, including polyester fabrics, ceramic tiles, certain papers, and specialty substrates. The most common materials are sublimation transfer paper and polyester garments. 

It's important to use materials specifically designed for sublimation printing to ensure optimal results and prevent damage to your printer. 


### What color support does an Epson sublimation printer offer?

Epson sublimation printers typically support a wide color gamut, capable of producing rich, vibrant colors. Most models come with four or six ink cartridges, allowing for both RGB and CMYK color outputs. 

For photographic-quality prints, you might consider using Epson's premium UltraChrome HD ink sets, which offer expanded color capabilities and superior print durability. 


### How long does it take to print with an Epson sublimation printer?

Print times vary depending on the print size and resolution. A standard 8.5x11 inch print at 300 dpi typically takes between 15-30 seconds. For larger prints, the process may take several minutes. 

After printing, the transfer paper needs to be heat-set for 60-90 seconds to permanently bond the dye to the substrate. This adds additional time to the overall print and transfer process. 


### What maintenance is required for an Epson sublimation printer?

Regular maintenance includes cleaning the printhead, checking ink levels, and replacing ink cartridges when needed. The printer's maintenance menu should be accessed weekly to perform self-diagnostic tests and cleaning cycles. 

Keep your print head clean by running maintenance routines and cleaning the print tray regularly to prevent clogs and maintain print quality. 


### How much does it cost to print with an Epson sublimation printer?

The cost per print varies based on ink consumption and print size. With standard four-color cartridges, a single print may cost around $0.05 to $0.10, depending on usage. 

Over time, the cost per print can be significantly reduced by using bulk ink or multiple smaller cartridges, though initial setup costs for the printer and materials may be higher.
