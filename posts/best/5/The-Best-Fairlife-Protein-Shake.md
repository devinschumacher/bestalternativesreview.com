## Buyer's Guide

Fairlife protein shakes have become popular solutions for both post-workout recovery and daily nutrition. These shakes are known for their high protein content and unique ingredients. When choosing a Fairlife protein shake, several factors can help you select the right product for your needs. 


### Protein Content and Quality

Look for protein shakes that deliver at least 20 grams per serving, as this is generally considered sufficient for most adults' daily protein needs. Higher-quality proteins, such as those derived from milk or pea protein, provide better amino acid profiles and may be easier to digest.

### Additional Nutritional Value

While protein is the primary focus, consider whether you want additional nutrients like calcium, vitamin D, or fiber included in your shake. These can enhance the shake's nutritional profile and provide complementary health benefits. 


### Caloric Content and Sweetness

Serving sizes can vary, so check the caloric content per serving to align with your dietary goals. Some people prefer unflavored options that require personalizing sweetness, while others might opt for pre-sweetened varieties that cater to specific taste preferences.

### Storage and Shelf Life

Their formula gives Fairlife shakes a longer shelf life compared to traditional protein shakes. However, you should still monitor the expiration date and store the unopened shake in a cool place. After opening, the shake typically remains good for 7-10 days when refrigerated properly.
