## Buyer's Guide

Braiding hair, also known as braided extensions or braided hair pieces, has become a popular choice for adding length, volume, and texture to natural hair. This section will help you understand the different types of human braiding hair available, their characteristics, and how to choose the right style for your needs. 


### Types of Human Braiding Hair

Braiding hair comes in various forms, including wefts, tape-ins, and clip-ins. Wefts are strips of braided hair sewn onto a foundation for permanente extensions, while tape-ins use adhesive tape systems to attach individual braids. Clip-ins offer the most flexibility, allowing you to add and remove braids as needed.

### Quality Considerations

When selecting human braiding hair, look for quality indicators such as realistic texture, natural shine, and proper knotting. High-quality extensions should feel lightweight and comfortable, with secure knots that prevent tangling. The hair should also maintain its shape and elasticity over time. 


### Application Methods

The application process differs between wefts, tape-ins, and clip-ins. Wefts require sewing techniques and may need to be integrated with existing hair, while tape-ins use adhesives applied directly to the scalp. Clip-ins are the most straightforward to install and remove. Consider your comfort level with each method when making your selection.

### Maintenance Requirements

Proper maintenance extends the life of your braiding hair and keeps it looking natural. Regular cleaning with specialized products prevents tangling and maintains shine. For wefts and tape-ins, daily upkeep includes gentle detangling and scalp cleaning. Clip-ins require less maintenance but should still be removed and cleaned regularly to prevent odor and buildup. 


## FAQ

![Human-Braiding-Hair-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Human-Braiding-Hair-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is human braiding hair made from?

Human braiding hair is typically made from Remy hair, which means the cuticles are aligned in the same direction, maintaining the hair's natural texture and shine. The hair can come from different sources, including donated hair, ethnic hair, or factory-made hair designed to replicate human hair quality. 

Processing involves multiple steps: washing to remove impurities, cutting to the desired length, and sometimes heat setting to improve texture. High-quality human braiding hair undergoes rigorous quality control to ensure consistent thickness and color. 


### What thickness options are available?

Human braiding hair is available in various thicknesses to suit different styling needs. Common thickness options range from 1.2mm to 1.4mm, providing flexibility for both fine and thick hair types. Premium quality hair often offers additional thickness options for those wanting a more natural look. 

Thickness consistency is crucial for braiding, with manufacturers typically offering both single strands and combined bundles for different braiding techniques. 

![Human-Braiding-Hair-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Human-Braiding-Hair-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How long does human braiding hair last?

With proper care, human braiding hair typically lasts between 6 to 12 months. Factors influencing longevity include maintenance, hair quality, and styling frequency. Higher-quality hair and regular care can extend the hair's wear time. 

Following aftercare instructions, such as regular shampooing and avoidance of harsh chemicals, can significantly impact the hair's lifespan. 


### What maintenance is required?

Minimal maintenance is needed, with regular shampooing every 2 to 3 weeks recommended. Using mild shampoo and avoiding harsh chemicals helps preserve the hair's quality. The hair should be washed with the lid closed to prevent tangling during the rinsing process. 

After washing, the hair should be left to air dry or dried using a microfiber towel. Once dry, any knots can be gently combed through with a wide-tooth comb. 

![Human-Braiding-Hair-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Human-Braiding-Hair-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can human braiding hair be dyed?

Braiding hair can be dyed, but results vary by quality. High-quality Remy hair maintains color better than lower-quality alternatives. Professional dyeing services typically produce the best results, with at-home dye kits available for less experienced users. 

Color retention depends on several factors including hair quality, dye product, and maintenance. Proper pre-dye conditioning can help improve color retention and smoothness of the hair. 


### What is the difference between Remy and Non-Remy hair?

Remy hair maintains all cuticles in one direction, preserving the hair's natural texture and shine. Non-Remy hair has cuticles that may point in different directions, which can affect the hair's appearance and texture. 

Remy hair generally costs more and provides better quality for braiding due to its natural handling and appearance. Non-Remy hair can be more economical but may require more preprocessing for consistent results.
