### [Marais 36" Square Brown Leather Ottoman](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Leather+Ottoman+Coffee+Table?utm\_term=marais-36-square-brown-leather-ottoman)

This leather-wrapped ottoman adds a touch of sophistication to any room, though its gold metal legs and sturdy wood frame are down-to-earth enough for everyday use. While it's elegant and well-made, the genuine top-grain leather can scuff easily, and some buyers have noted that the metal support pieces can be a bit unstable. Overall, it's a bit disappointing for the higher price point, with many wishing it offered more durability or fewer quality control issues.

## Buyer's Guide

A leather ottoman coffee table combines stylish storage with cozy comfort. These versatile pieces complement both contemporary and traditional interiors, offering a practical centerpiece for any living room. 


### Size and Space Considerations

Measure your available space to determine the appropriate dimensions. Standard sizes range from 20-36 inches in diameter. Consider the room's overall layout and traffic flow when selecting a specific size. 

Storage capacity varies by design. Deep ottomans provide generous storage inside, while shallower models offer less space but maintain clean lines. 


### Quality of Leather and Construction

Invest in genuine leather for durability and premium feel. Aniline leather offers the best quality, with minimal processing that reveals natural grain markings. Avoid imitation leather substitutes for longevity and appearance. 

Evaluate the craftsmanship through close inspection. Strong stitching, secure joinery, and consistent leather quality indicate a higher standard of construction. 


### Maintenance Requirements

Leather requires regular maintenance to retain its appearance. Look for pieces that offer stain-resistant treatments during the manufacturing process. Check if the ottoman includes protective detailing like edge sealing to prevent unraveling. The base and legs should also receive attention to prevent scratches and wear from everyday use. 


### Storage Functionality

Storage ottomans with quality locks and mechanisms prevent strain on the leather and reduce wear. Look for models with smooth, silent openings and secure closures. Consider the arrangement of storage compartments. Multi-compartment designs can make organization challenging, while single-section storage provides simpler access.
