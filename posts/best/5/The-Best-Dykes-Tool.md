## FAQ

![Dykes-Tool-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Dykes-Tool-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a Dykes Tool and how is it used?

A Dykes Tool is a precision measuring instrument used primarily in metalworking and engineering applications. It features a series of accurately graduated scales that allow for precise measurements of small distances, angles, and depths. 

The tool's design permits quick and accurate measurements without the need for complex calculations, making it particularly useful for quality control, inspection, and detailed work where precision is critical. 


### What are the key features of Dykes Tools?

Key features include an ergonomic handle for comfort during use, precision-machined scales with fine graduations, and a protective cap that keeps the measuring scales clean and protected when not in use. 

Most models include interchangeable anvil faces and sliding scales, allowing the tool to be adapted for various measurement applications including depth, height, and angle measurements. 

![Dykes-Tool-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Dykes-Tool-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the main types of Dykes Tools?

The two main types are calipers and micrometers. Calipers measure outside and inside dimensions, while micrometers measure external and internal dimensions with high precision. 

Both types come in standard and inside versions, with digital options available for added accuracy in measurements beyond the tool's maximum capacity. 


### What is the typical range of measurements for Dykes Tools?

Standard calipers measure from 0 to 2 inches or 0 to 5 inches, adjustable to accommodate various workpiece sizes. Micrometers typically measure from 0 to 6 inches with digital models expanding this range. 

Inside calipers and micrometers measure internal dimensions with similar ranges, though their maximum capacity is usually half that of their external counterparts. 

![Dykes-Tool-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Dykes-Tool-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)

Regular cleaning with a soft cloth and mild soap prevents dirt and debris from accumulating in the measuring gaps. The tool should be stored in its protective cap when not in use to prevent damage to the measuring surfaces. 

The scales should be inspected regularly for signs of wear or damage. If the tool is used daily or in demanding environments, calibration should be performed annually to maintain accuracy. 


### Where can I purchase Dykes Tools?

Dykes Tools are available through authorized dealers, industrial supply outlets, and online platforms specializing in measuring tools. Many manufacturers also offer direct-purchase options through their official webstores. 

The tools come in various packaging options, from individual units for occasional use to sets that include multiple tools and accessories for comprehensive measurement capabilities.
