## FAQ


### What are Oc tennis shoes?

Oc tennis shoes are lightweight, specialized footwear designed specifically for tennis players. These shoes combine excellent traction with minimal weight to enhance performance on the court. 

Key features include durable rubber soles for court grip, breathable mesh uppers for ventilation, and precise foot stabilization to reduce the risk of injury during quick movements.

The specialized design also offers better ankle support and foot lockdown, helping to prevent common tennis injuries like sprains and strains.

Start by measuring your foot with a flexible ruler, including your heel-to-ball length and arch height. Compare these measurements to the shoe's sizing chart, allowing for about a half-size more than your regular shoe size for proper looseness and room for socks. 

Consider trying them on later in the day when your feet are slightly swollen, as this gives the most accurate sizing. 


### How long do Oc tennis shoes typically last?

While they perform well on various surfaces, always check the specific court conditions before your match. For example, clay courts may require different shoe selection strategies compared to hard courts.
