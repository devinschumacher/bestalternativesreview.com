Most chenille stems come in standard red, but many crafts stores offer an expanding palette of pastel and solid colors. The softer the color, the more prominent the texture becomes. Consider whether you prefer subtle shading or vibrant solids for your project. 


### Size and Length Variations

Stem lengths range from short floral pieces (3-4 inches) to extended versions (12-18 inches). Smaller sizes work well for detailed work or miniature projects, while longer stems suit larger arrangements or span multiple elements together.

### Are Chenille Stems environmentally friendly?

Unlike single-use plastic straws, chenille straws can be reused multiple times, reducing waste. However, they are not biodegradable and should be disposed of properly. 

These straws are a better alternative to plastic for single-use scenarios but may not be suitable for large-scale events without proper recycling infrastructure. 


### What maintenance is needed for Chenille Stems?

Regularly inspect the straws for signs of wear or damage. Replace them if they become damaged or discolored. 

Hand washing with mild soap and water is sufficient for cleaning. Avoid using harsh chemicals or high heat, as they can damage the straws.

These straws perform well with cold liquids, maintaining their integrity and shape. They're particularly suitable for serving cold beverages. 

Avoid using them with hot liquids, as this can cause melting and damage to the straw's structure. 


### What are the size options for Chenille Stems?

Chenille stems typically come in standard sizes, ranging from 7 to 10 inches in length. Some manufacturers offer longer options, up to 12 inches. 

For children or specific applications, shorter sizes are also available. Always check the size specifications of the product you're considering.
