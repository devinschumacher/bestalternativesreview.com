These Y2K vintage Mudd jeans have a distinctive flare and distressed look that's straight out of the tag.

Mudd Jeans represent a unique blend of performance and sustainability in outdoor apparel. Created by Mudd, a company founded on environmental responsibility, these jeans showcase innovative materials and manufacturing processes designed for both comfort and durability. 


### Mud-Repellent Technology

Mudd's signature mud-repellent technology is what sets their jeans apart. The fabric is treated with a non-toxic, waterproof coating that prevents soil and mud from adhering, making them ideal for outdoor activities. This treatment does not affect the jeans' breathability or stretch properties. 


### Eco-Friendly Materials

The company prioritizes sustainability through the use of organic cotton and recycled materials. Their jeans often incorporate both of these components, reducing environmental impact while maintaining quality. Understanding the percentage of each material helps in choosing the most sustainable option. 


### Fit and Construction

Mudd offers a range of fits including slim, regular, and relaxed, allowing for personal preference. The construction focuses on durability with reinforced stitching in key areas. The jeans typically feature a higher rise and straighter leg shape, which may affect comfort for those preferring more relaxed styles. 


### Care and Maintenance

Care instructions vary by model, but most Mudd jeans require regular washing every 1-2 wears. The non-toxic coating needs special attention during drying to prevent creasing. Proper maintenance ensures longevity and preserves the performance of the mud-repellent technology.
