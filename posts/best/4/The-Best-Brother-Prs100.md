## Buyer's Guide

When selecting a thermal receipt printer, the Brother PR-S100 offers several advantages due to its compact design and reliable performance. This guide will help you understand the key features and considerations for choosing the right thermal printer for your business needs. 


### Print Quality and Durability

The PR-S100 delivers high-quality, heat-sensitive receipts with sharp text and vibrant graphics. The thermal printhead ensures consistent print quality with minimal maintenance requirements. Consider the contrast settings for black-on-yellow receipts, as the default settings may need adjustment for optimal visibility. 


### Print Speed and Efficiency

Print speeds of 95 characters per second make the PR-S100 suitable for fast-food restaurants and retail environments where quick receipts are essential. The printer's auto-cutting feature reduces paper waste, while the optional paper roll provides greater capacity than competitor models. For businesses with high-volume printing needs, the auto-cut mode may produce slightly shorter receipts than manual cutting. 


### Power Consumption and Operating Requirements

The PR-S100 operates on minimal power, with an estimated annual energy consumption of 40 watts. The printer requires a consistent power supply and proper ventilation for reliable operation. The included mounting kit allows flexible placement options, but the printer's footprint still requires adequate space between it and other equipment. 


### Compatibility and Setup

The PR-S100 works with standard 50mm thermal paper rolls and connects via USB or Bluetooth for wireless printing. The setup process is straightforward, requiring basic configuration for both connection types. For integrated systems, consider printing to a virtual COM port instead of the USB port to avoid conflicts with other devices. 


## FAQ


### What does the Brother PRS100 include in its standard package?

The PRS100 package includes a printer, power adapter, ribbon, and basic manuals. The printer is ready to use out of the box, with all necessary components bundled for immediate functionality. 

Note that installation software may need to be downloaded separately from Brother's website for optimal performance and feature access. 


### Can I print from my tablet or smartphone directly to the PRS100?

Yes, the PRS100 supports direct printing from compatible Android and iOS devices through Brother's iPrint&Reg mobile app. The app enables wireless printing and scan-to-phone functionality for convenience. 

Direct printing requires a mobile device, compatible app, and internet connection. The printer needs to be connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your mobile device for seamless printing. 


### What is the maximum print resolution of the PRS100?

The printer can achieve a maximum print resolution of 2400 x 600 dpi, which provides excellent text clarity and image quality for photos and documents. 

While the printer supports higher resolutions, practical print settings usually range between 600 to 1200 dpi for most print jobs to balance quality and speed. 


### How much paper capacity does the PRS100 offer?

The printer includes a 250-sheet standard paper capacity, with a manual feed slot for additional sheets. This allows for continuous printing without frequent paper changes. 

For bulk printing, you can use the optional rear-feed unit, which doubles the paper capacity to 500 sheets, suitable for large document runs. 


### What kind of connectivity options does the PRS100 provide?

The PRS100 offers standard USB 2.0 for direct computer connectivity and wireless 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi for network printing. Both options ensure versatile printing solutions for different office setups. 

For setups without internet access, the USB port allows direct printing from computers without network configuration. 


### How does the PRS100 handle black-and-white versus color printing?

Black-and-white printing is more efficient and uses less media. The printer automatically defaults to black-and-white mode for text documents to save costs and ink. 

Color printing is available but uses more media, including both paper and ink. Users can adjust print settings to balance color quality and cost according to their needs.
