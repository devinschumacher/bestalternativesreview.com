## Buyer's Guide

When choosing a Simplisafe outdoor camera, several key features and considerations will help you select the right camera for your security needs. Understanding these aspects ensures you make an informed decision that meets your specific requirements. 


### Camera Specifications

Look for cameras with HD or 4K resolution for clear, detailed footage. Check if the camera offers night vision capabilities with infrared LEDs for visibility in low light conditions. The field of view (FoV) is also important, with wider angles providing more coverage but potentially reducing image quality. 


### Audio and Video Quality

Audio performance varies between models. Consider cameras with two-way audio for clear communication. Video stability during movement and in windy conditions is crucial, especially for outdoor installations. Look for cameras with image stabilization technology to minimize shaky footage. 


### Installation and Setup

Installation requirements differ between models. Some cameras mount magnetically or attach via screws, while others require professional installation. The setup process should be straightforward, with mobile app compatibility for easy configuration and monitoring. 


### Storage and Connectivity

Storage options include local SD card storage and cloud-based solutions. Local storage allows offline viewing but requires regular card replacement, while cloud storage provides unlimited recording but may incur subscription fees. Wi-Fi connectivity enables remote access and app notifications, while some models offer cellular backup for internet outages.

### How does the audio feature work?

The two-way audio allows you to hear and speak with anyone in the camera's field of view. The audio quality is clear in most outdoor environments, but wind can affect sound transmission. 

You can use the audio feature to deter intruders or check on your property. The camera's microphone cuts off after a few seconds to comply with privacy regulations. 


### What about privacy concerns?

Simplisafe takes privacy seriously and provides several options for remote management. You can arm and disarm the camera, as well as control audio and video features through the app. 

The camera's video is encrypted both in transit and at rest. You have full control over footage storage and can choose to retain or delete recordings as needed.
