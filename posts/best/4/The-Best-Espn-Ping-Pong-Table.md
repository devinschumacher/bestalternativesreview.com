### Size and Space Requirements

The standard ESPN table measures 9 x 5 feet, with a playing surface of 8 feet by 2.75 feet. Before purchasing, measure your available space to confirm adequate clearance for the table and player movement. Consider storage options for when the table is not in use. 


### Construction and Quality

Look for tables constructed with 3/4-inch solid wood or MDF with veneer coating for durability and stability. The playing surface should be melamine-finished to provide a smooth, consistent bounce. Quality bearings in the legs and adjustable leveling legs are essential for maintaining the table's position and longevity.
