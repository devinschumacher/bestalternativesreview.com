## Buyer's Guide

Sun gloves offer essential protection against harmful UV rays while keeping your hands comfortable during outdoor activities. When selecting the right pair, consider these key features and factors to ensure you choose gloves that meet your specific needs. 


### UV Protection Ratings

Look for gloves with UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor) ratings of 30 or higher. The UPF rating indicates how effectively the gloves block UV radiation. Higher UPF values provide better protection, though even modest ratings significantly reduce your skin's exposure to harmful rays.

### Material and Construction

Gloves vary in material, with common choices including polyester, nylon, and Lycra blends. These materials offer good protection while remaining breathable and flexible. Consider gloves with a double-layered backhand for improved UV resistance and moisture-wicking properties. 


### Hand Fit and Design

A proper fit is crucial for both comfort and protection. Gloves should have a snug fit without being too tight, allowing for natural hand movement. Consider different styles such as cuffed, semi-fingered, or fingerless to find the most comfortable option for your activities. The palm and fingers should be reinforced for durability.

### Additional Features

Look for gloves with additional features that enhance both protection and functionality. These can include wrist snaps for secure fit, elastic panels for improved dexterity, or specific grip patterns on the palm for better control during activities. Some gloves offer antimicrobial treatments to prevent odor and reduce bacteria growth. 


## FAQ

![Sun-Gloves-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Sun-Gloves-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are sun gloves?

Sun gloves are specialized protective clothing worn on the hands to shield the skin from harmful UV rays. They combine sun protection with basic glove functionality, keeping your hands covered while allowing flexibility and grip. 

These gloves typically feature a higher level of protection than standard summer gloves, with some offering UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor) ratings of 50+ for maximum sun defense. 


### Who should wear sun gloves?

Sun gloves are ideal for outdoor enthusiasts who spend extended periods in the sun, including hikers, cyclists, golfers, and beachgoers. They're particularly beneficial for people with sensitive skin, those who burn easily, and individuals working outdoors. 

These gloves can also be useful in other contexts where sun protection is important, such as during car travel, outdoor sports, or when working with materials that can increase sun sensitivity. 

![Sun-Gloves-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Sun-Gloves-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What should I look for when selecting sun gloves?

When choosing sun gloves, look for those with a high UPF rating (50+), durable water-repellent or waterproof materials, and secure closures like elastic wrist bands. The gloves should also offer good dexterity and grip to maintain functionality. 

Additional features to consider include moisture-wicking lining for comfort during activities, reinforced stitching in critical areas, and variations in sizing and hand shape options. Check compatibility with other protective gear you may use. 


### How do I care for sun gloves?

Clean sun gloves regularly using mild soap and water, avoiding harsh chemicals that can damage the protective properties of the fabric. For persistent stains, use a gentle detergent and avoid abrasive scrubbers. 

Store your sun gloves in a cool, dry place when not in use, away from direct sunlight. Consider using a garment bag for protection during travel or storage. Avoid ironing the gloves as high heat can damage the protective qualities of the material. 

![Sun-Gloves-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Sun-Gloves-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can I wash sun gloves with regular gloves?

While you can wash sun gloves with regular gloves, it's best to wash them separately to prevent snagging and maintain their protective integrity. Use the gentle cycle in a washing machine or hand wash them to avoid damaging the elastic and stitching. 

Avoid mixing them with items that have zippers, hooks, or other sharp closures that could snag the gloves during washing or storage. 


### How long do sun gloves last?

Sun gloves typically last between 6 months to 2 years with regular use, depending on the quality of the material and how they're cared for. The protection factor may decrease over time due to washing and exposure to sunlight. 

Check for signs of wear such as thinning material, loose stitching, or fraying at the edges. Replace gloves that show signs of damage or reduced protection to ensure continued sun protection.
