Boho wall hangings typically incorporate these characteristics through handmade techniques, natural fibers, and vibrant colors, creating a unique and personalized decorative statement for any room.

### How should I measure for a boho wall hanging?

First, determine the desired height for your wall hanging, considering the room's height and ceiling. Common lengths range from 60 to 120 inches, providing both subtle and dramatic accents. 

Next, measure from your intended mounting point to the floor or ceiling, subtracting any existing fixtures or room features. This will help you achieve balanced placement without overcrowding the space. 


### What styles of rooms work best with boho wall hangings?

Boho wall hangings look particularly striking in living rooms, bedrooms, and lounges where you can appreciate their rich detail and natural elements. They complement various design styles, from modern minimalist environments to eclectic bohemian interiors. 

These hangings work especially well in spaces featuring distressed wood, woven baskets, vintage furniture, or elements inspired by global travel and natural environments.

### How can I care for my boho wall hanging?

Most boho wall hangings require minimal care. Natural materials like cotton and jute benefit from spot cleaning with a damp cloth when necessary. Always clean from the back to prevent dirt from collecting on the front surface. 

Avoid direct sunlight and harsh chemicals that could damage the fibers. Store your wall hanging in a dry place when not in use, preferably on a padded hanger to maintain its shape. 


### Can I customize a boho wall hanging?

Many boho wall hangings are available in standard sizes and designs, perfect for quick room updates. However, if you need something specific, many craft stores and online retailers offer customizable options like different colors, shapes, or materials. 

For unique pieces, consider working with local artisans who may accommodate special requests for size, material selection, or custom patterns to match your existing decor.
