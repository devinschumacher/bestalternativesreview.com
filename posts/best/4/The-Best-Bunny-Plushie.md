### Care Requirements

Plushies require regular care to maintain their appearance and hygiene. Check if the plushie is machine washable and if so, what settings work best (cold water and gentle cycle usually suffice). Some may need spot cleaning or air drying instead of tumble drying to prevent damage. 


## FAQ

![Bunny-Plushie-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Bunny-Plushie-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the most common materials used to make bunny plushies?

Bunny plushies are typically made from soft fabrics like polyester fleece, velour, or cotton blend materials. Some premium plushies use premium fabrics like minky or even wool to achieve a particular texture. 

The stuffing inside is usually polyester fiberfill, which provides good weight and huggability. A few high-end designs incorporate down alternative or natural fiber stuffing for an even more premium feel. 


### How can you tell if a bunny plushie is well-made?

A high-quality bunny plushie will have evenly distributed stuffing with no lumps or uneven spots. The seams should be neat and double-stitched for durability, with tags securely sewn in place. 

Check for smooth, clean construction with no loose threads. Premium pieces will have soft, dense stuffing that's consistent throughout the body without stiffness.

### What sizes are available for bunny plushies?

Bunny plushies come in various sizes, typically ranging from small travel-friendly options measuring around 6-8 inches to larger cuddle-sized pieces at 12-18 inches. 

Some specialty sizes are available for collectors or specific uses, but most standard designs fall within these general size ranges. 


### How should you care for a bunny plushie?

Bunny plushies are usually machine washable in a gentle cycle using cold water and a mild detergent. Avoid using bleach or fabric softeners as they can damage the fabric. 

Air drying is recommended to maintain the plush texture, or use a low heat setting on your dryer with a few tennis balls to keep the stuffing loose and fluffy.
