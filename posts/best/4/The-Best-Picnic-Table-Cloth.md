## Buyer's Guide

A picnic table cloth serves as both a practical and aesthetic solution for outdoor dining. These versatile pieces protect your table while adding a pop of color or pattern to your gathering. When selecting a picnic table cloth, consider factors like material durability, moisture resistance, and ease of cleaning to find the perfect fit for your needs. 


### Material Durability

The most durable materials for picnic table cloths include polyester blends and cottonduck. These fabrics resist tears and wear well under outdoor conditions. Higher thread counts and reinforced stitching at stress points enhance longevity. For heavier-duty use, look for specialized outdoor table cloths designed to withstand frequent exposure to the elements. 


### Moisture Resistance

A quality picnic table cloth should repel water and resist staining from food and beverages. Fabric treatments that provide permanent water repellency are ideal for outdoor use. Some cloths feature microfiber or waxed surfaces that prevent liquid penetration while allowing air flow. This feature not only protects your cloth but also makes it easier to clean spills. 


### Ease of Cleaning

Look for picnic table cloths with quick-drying properties and easy-to-clean surfaces. Those made from polyester or other synthetic materials typically retain their shape and color during washing. Many outdoor cloths now feature stain-resistant finishes that make clean-up simple with just water and mild detergent. Avoid cloths with complex patterns or embedded elements that may harbor dirt and require special cleaning. 


### Size and Coverage

When measuring your table, account for the need to drape the cloth over the edges for stability. A standard table size requires a cloth that's approximately 5% larger in both length and width. For stability and protection, consider cloths that extend at least 6 inches beyond the table edges. If you'll be using your cloth frequently at different table sizes, opt for a larger, multipurpose piece that can be easily folded and stored. 


## FAQ


### Materials and Construction

Most picnic table cloths are made from durable polyester or cotton blends, which resist stains and weather damage. Premium options incorporate UV protection to prevent color fading and moisture barriers to keep food dry during rain or dew. 

These cloths typically feature reinforced edges and corner grommets for easy securing, with heavier-duty designs incorporating reinforced stitching at stress points. Quality cloths measure between 48 to 60 inches square to provide ample coverage for standard picnic tables. 


### Size and Coverage

Standard picnic cloths measure 48 to 60 inches square, providing generous coverage for most outdoor tables. For larger or oval tables, look for cloths that measure 60 to 72 inches, or consider purchasing two smaller cloths that can be positioned end-to-end. 

Always measure your table's surface area before selecting a cloth to ensure proper coverage. Add a few inches to account for overhang at the edges, which helps prevent spills from pooling under the cloth. 


### Protection Features

High-quality picnic cloths incorporate protective features like UV protection, water-resistant coatings, and moisture barriers. These features extend the cloth's lifespan by preventing color fading, water damage, and mold growth. 

Look for cloths that incorporate seam sealing or edge stitching to prevent fraying and extend durability. Some premium options include replaceable table protectors, which prevent direct contact with the table surface and extend the cloth's lifespan. 


### Care and Maintenance

The most durable picnic cloths are machine washable and can be tumble dried on low heat. To extend their lifespan, wash cloths separately to prevent snagging and check seams regularly for signs of wear. 

When not in use, store cloths folded rather than rolled to prevent permanent creasing. Store in a dry location away from direct sunlight to prevent color fading and maintain optimal condition. 


### Durability and Long-term Use

Premium picnic cloths made from polyester or cotton blends can last 3 to 5 years with regular use and proper care. Factors affecting lifespan include exposure to sunlight, frequency of use, and adherence to care instructions. 

For extended outdoor use, consider cloths with UV protection and moisture barriers, as these features significantly enhance durability. With proper care, quality cloths can maintain their appearance and functionality for multiple seasons. 


### Cost Considerations

Picnic table cloths range from $10 to $30, with premium options exceeding $30 for enhanced features like UV protection and moisture barriers. The cost largely depends on material quality, size, and additional features like table protectors. 

While higher-priced cloths may seem expensive, they often provide better value due to extended lifespan and superior protection. For frequent outdoor use, investing in a high-quality cloth can be more economical than replacing cheaper cloths annually.
