The Tvilum Portland 6 Drawer Double Dresser brings a touch of contemporary styling to small spaces with its foil-finished surface and sleek lines. Despite its simple design, the dresser manages to provide decent storage with its six drawers, though the shallow depth means it's best for items like underwear and socks rather than full-length items. The plastic pewter handles offer a nice design element, though the dressers' tendency to flex in the middle and the poor quality of the hardware make it more suitable for light use.

### [Tvilum Austin 8-Drawer Dresser](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Brown+Wood+Dresser?utm\_term=tvilum-austin-8-drawer-dresser)

When building the Tvilum Austin dressers, you'll need about 2.5 hours and some patience – the instructions are basic picture guides rather than detailed step-by-step directions. While the contemporary design with its white plastic handles looks sleek in small spaces, the drawers have cheap cardboard backing that won't support heavy loads. Most buyers note the bottom drawers need clear floor space for proper opening, and the overall construction quality feels low for the price point.

## Buyer's Guide

A brown wood dresser brings warmth and character to any bedroom while providing ample storage space. Here's what to consider when selecting the perfect brown wood dresser for your space. 


### Dimensions and Layout

Measure your available space carefully, including doorways and existing furniture. Consider the dresser's footprint and depth to ensure it fits comfortably in your room. Single drawers or open shelves might be more practical than deep, multiple-drawer configurations for smaller spaces.

### MATERIAL Quality and Finish

Invest in craftsmanship by choosing dressers with solid wood construction rather than particle board or veneers. Opt for natural wood finishes that minimize synthetic compounds, which can off-gas volatile organic compounds (VOCs). 


### Storage Features

Think about your storage needs: tall dressers with deep drawers excel for clothing storage, while narrower dressers with open shelving work well for displaying personal items. Consider adding built-in organizers like shelf dividers or under-drawer organizers for better space utilization.

### Style and Size Options

Brown wood dressers come in various styles from modern minimalist to traditional ornate designs. The finish should complement your existing furniture while maintaining a consistent visual flow. Check if the piece offers both full and half-length mirrors for different styling options. 


## FAQ

![Brown-Wood-Dresser-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Brown-Wood-Dresser-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What materials are used to construct brown wood dressers?

Brown wood dressers are typically crafted from solid wood, engineered wood, or a combination of both. Solid wood options include oak, cherry, and maple, while engineered wood features a core of composite material topped with real wood veneers. This dual construction offers a balance of durability and affordability. 

High-quality dressers often feature hardwood frames with premium wood finishes that protect the surface and resist scratches and dents. The choice of material affects both the appearance and longevity of the piece. 


### How do I measure for a brown wood dresser?

Measure the available space in your room, including the width, depth, and height. Add a few inches to each measurement to account for door openings and hallway allowances. This ensures the dresser will fit comfortably in your chosen location. 

Measure from the floor to the desired height and consider the space above and between furniture pieces. Proper measurement prevents both overhang and clearance issues. 

![Brown-Wood-Dresser-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Brown-Wood-Dresser-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What finishes are available for brown wood dressers?

Most brown wood dressers offer a natural wood finish that enhances the grain and color of the wood, while others feature stained or painted options. Some manufacturers also provide distressing effects or vintage finishes that give the piece an aged appearance. 

Consider your room's existing furniture and interior color scheme when selecting a finish. Natural wood finishes complement modern and traditional styles, while painted or distressed finishes work well with eclectic and vintage decor. 


### What size options are available for brown wood dressers?

Brown wood dressers come in various sizes, from compact 2-drawer units to expansive 6-drawer configurations. Common sizes range from 48 to 84 inches in height, with widths typically between 20 and 60 inches. 

Select a size that matches your available space and storage needs. Smaller dressers work well in bedroom retreats or small rooms, while larger options provide ample storage for guest rooms or home offices.

### What features should I look for in a brown wood dresser?

Key features include adjustable shelves, interior organizer systems, and multiple drawer configurations. Look for dressers with soft-close drawers and doors, sturdy construction, and premium hardware. Additional features like mirrored doors, LED lighting, or built-in charging ports enhance functionality and style. 

Consider the finish quality, material durability, and assembly requirements. High-quality dressers often feature hardwood frames and premium construction details that impact both appearance and longevity. 


### How do I maintain the wood finish on my brown wood dresser?

Regular maintenance keeps the wood finish looking new. Dust the surface weekly with a microfiber cloth and clean more thoroughly with a wood-specific cleaner bi-monthly. Avoid harsh chemicals and abrasive materials that can damage the finish. 

Protect the dresser from direct sunlight and extreme temperature changes to prevent warping and fading. Apply furniture-grade polish annually to maintain a lustrous finish and add protection against daily wear.
