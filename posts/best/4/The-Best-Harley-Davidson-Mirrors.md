These mirrors, originally designed for a 2006 Harley-Davidson Road King, have seen their fair share of road trips and might have picked up a few scratches along the way. The deep cobalt blue finish still looks great, though you might want to give them a quick polish before mounting them on your 2012 Electra Glide Ultra Limited. Since they're coming from the US, you'll want to watch out for any import taxes or duties that might apply to your order. 


## Buyer's Guide

Harley Davidson mirrors play a crucial role in rider safety and visibility, so selecting the right ones is essential. These mirrors enhance your field of view, allowing you to monitor side traffic and improve your awareness of your surroundings while riding. 


### Size and Position

Mirror size directly affects their effectiveness. Larger mirrors provide better visibility but may be more challenging to fit in certain spots. The position of the mirrors is equally important - they should be mounted at an angle that offers clear visibility without causing glare. 


### Material and Durability

Quality materials ensure your mirrors last through various weather conditions and incidents. Look for mirrors made from durable plastic or metal that resists scratches, cracks, and UV damage. Durability is especially crucial for motorcycle mirrors, which face harsh environmental conditions. 


### Mounting Options

The mirror's mounting system must be robust enough to withstand the forces exerted while riding, including vibrations and impacts. Some mirrors feature adjustable mounts that allow you to fine-tune the angle, while others have fixed mounts that require proper positioning during installation. 


### Regulatory Compliance

Ensure your chosen mirrors meet local regulations regarding mirror size, placement, and assembly. Some regions have specific requirements for motorcycle mirrors that affect both functionality and legality. Understanding these regulations helps you select mirrors that perform well while remaining compliant with the law. 


## FAQ


### What types of mirrors are available for Harley Davidson motorcycles?

Harley Davidson offers a variety of mirror options, including standard convex mirrors and larger, more aerodynamic super mirrors. These mirrors come in different mounting styles to fit various model years and configurations. 

Super mirrors feature a longer reach and deeper curvature, providing increased visibility over standard mirrors while reducing wind noise. They are particularly popular for touring models and riders who prioritize visibility over compact size. 


### How do I know which Harley Davidson mirror is right for my bike?

The correct mirror for your Harley Davidson motorcycle depends on your specific model, year, and intended use. Harley Davidson mirrors are designed to fit specific bike models and years, so checking your owner's manual or Harley Davidson's official website is crucial. 

Consider factors like your riding position, intended use (city riding, touring, commuting), and any modifications you've made to your bike. Consulting with a local Harley Davidson dealer can also help you select the right mirror. 


### Can I install aftermarket mirrors on my Harley Davidson?

While Harley Davidson mirrors are the recommended choice for your bike, some aftermarket options are available. Always ensure any aftermarket mirror you choose is compatible with your specific model and meets Harley Davidson's size and mounting requirements. 

Aftermarket mirrors may offer unique styling options or improved visibility features. However, they may not include the same mounting hardware or fit as perfectly as original equipment mirrors. 


### What maintenance is required for Harley Davidson mirrors?

Regularly inspect your Harley Davidson mirrors for damage, loose mounting bolts, or signs of wear. Check the mirror mounts and adjust the mirror position if it has shifted. 

Harley Davidson mirrors require standard maintenance like cleaning and protection against damage. Clean the mirrors regularly with a appropriate cleaning solution and protect them from scratches and impacts. 


### How do I adjust the height of my Harley Davidson mirrors?

Most Harley Davidson mirrors feature adjustable mounts that allow you to raise or lower the mirror. Use a wrench or Allen key to loosen the mounting screws, adjust the mirror height, and then tighten the screws securely. 

If your mirror mounts are fixed in place, you may need to replace them with adjustable mounts or consider mounting an aftermarket mirror that offers height adjustment. 


### What is the warranty coverage for Harley Davidson mirrors?

Harley Davidson typically offers a limited warranty on their mirrors, usually covering defects in materials and workmanship for a specific period. Check your warranty documentation for details on coverage and duration. 

Aftermarket mirrors may offer different warranty terms. Always review the warranty information that comes with your mirror and keep your receipt for proof of purchase.
