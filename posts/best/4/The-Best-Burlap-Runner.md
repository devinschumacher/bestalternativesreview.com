## Buyer's Guide

A burlap runner brings both texture and warmth to any room, combining practicality with rustic charm. When selecting the right burlap runner, consider a few key factors to ensure it meets your needs and enhances your space. 


### Size and Dimension

The ideal burlap runner size depends on your intended use and room dimensions. Common lengths range from 2 to 9 feet, while widths typically measure 6 to 12 inches. For hallway runners, aim for a length that extends 6 inches beyond your doorway openings. In broader spaces like living rooms or entryways, consider runners that cover at least 80% of the room's width. 


### Material Quality

Burlap quality varies between thin, loosely woven fabrics and thick, tightly constructed materials. Higher-quality burlap runners resist unraveling, maintain their shape, and withstand regular foot traffic. The fabric should feel dense to the touch and show minimal stretch when pulled diagonally. 


### Construction details

Look for runners with reinforced edges and secure stitching, particularly at the corners and ends. Some runners feature hidden binding or selvedge edges, while others have visible seams. The backing material (canvas, cotton, or felt) should be durable enough to prevent curling and maintain the runner's shape. 


### Washability and Care

Basic care requirements vary between burlap runners, with some needing gentle hand washing and others tolerating machine washing. High-quality runners typically come with care instructions indicating whether they can be washed in a washing machine. Consider runners with water-resistant backing for easier maintenance in high-traffic areas. 


## FAQ


### What is a burlap runner?

A burlap runner is a length of burlap fabric, typically between 3 to 6 feet in length, designed to protect the soil in newly planted flower beds, vegetable gardens, or mulched areas from erosion and direct rainfall. 

These runners usually come rolled at 3 feet long, with a 6-foot version also available for larger gardens. The material is biodegradable and eventually decomposes, leaving nutrients in the soil as it breaks down. 


### How do you use a burlap runner?

Unroll the burlap runner over your planted area or mulched bed, positioning it slightly beyond the edges to form a barrier. The overlap should face the incoming water to effectively direct rain runoff away from your plants. 

Use landscape staples or bricks to secure the corners and edges of the burlap, preventing it from shifting or displacing. For larger areas, overlap the runners by one-third to create a continuous barrier. 


### What are the benefits of using burlap runners?

The primary benefit is erosion control, as the burlap helps prevent soil from washing away during heavy rain. It also reduces water splashing onto plant leaves, which can lead to fungal diseases. 

Additionally, burlap runners suppress weeds, maintain consistent soil moisture, and can improve soil health by gradually breaking down and releasing organic matter. 


### How long do burlap runners take to decompose?

Under ideal conditions, a burlap runner will decompose within 6-12 months. Factors affecting breakdown include temperature, moisture, and exposure to sunlight. 

During decomposition, the burlap naturally releases nutrients into the soil, acting as a slow-release fertilizer and improving soil structure. 


### What are the limitations of using burlap runners?

While effective, burlap runners are not a permanent solution and need to be replaced annually. They are most suitable for short-term protection, particularly in rainy seasons or during establishment of young plants. 

During very hot weather, the burlap can heat up and potentially damage plant roots, though this is less common with proper installation and regular monitoring. 


### How should you maintain burlap runners?

Regularly inspect the runners for damage or fraying, especially after heavy storms. Secure any loose corners or edges to prevent soil erosion. 

Remove the runners before the growing season to allow proper plant growth and to prevent tangling with plant roots. Store unused runners in a dry place for future use.
