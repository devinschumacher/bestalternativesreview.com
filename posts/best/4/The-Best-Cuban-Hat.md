## Buyer's Guide

Cuban hats, also known as boater hats, combine style and functionality with their classic white color and four-cornered silhouette. These hats offer UV protection while maintaining airflow, making them suitable for various outdoor activities. The most common materials are plastic and woven straw, each with distinct characteristics to consider when making a purchase. 


### Materials

Plastic Cuban hats are lightweight, durable, and resistant to moisture and fading. They typically retain their shape well and are ideal for active use. Woven straw hats, on the other hand, provide excellent ventilation and a more natural look, though they may need regular maintenance to prevent mold and require protection from water. 


### Construction Quality

Pay attention to the hat's stitching and seams, as quality construction affects both durability and comfort. Well-made hats will have even stitching around the edges and secure ties or ribbons. The crown should sit straight without distortion, and the hat should sit level on your head without wobbling. 


### Size and Fit

Proper sizing is crucial for both comfort and protection. Most hats come in standard sizes, but it's important to check the specific brand's sizing guide. Measure your head circumference and compare it to the hat's sizing chart. Consider trying on the hat in person if possible, as different brands may have varying levels of stretch and fit. 


### UV Protection and Care

Look for hats with a wide brim that provides 360-degree UV protection. The color should be pure white plastic or fully bleached straw to ensure optimal sun protection. Understand the care requirements for your hat material – plastic hats typically need minimal maintenance, while straw hats may require regular cleaning and storage in a protective bag when not in use.
