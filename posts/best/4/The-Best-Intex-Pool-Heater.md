## Buyer's Guide

Intex pool heaters offer an affordable way to maintain warm water in your inflatable pool. Understanding their features and specifications will help you choose the right size and type to meet your needs. 


### Heating Capacity

Select an Intex heater based on your pool's volume. Common capacities range from 2,500 to 10,000 watts. Calculate your pool's volume in gallons, then multiply by 5 to determine wattage needs. Larger pools may require multiple heaters.

### Power Source

Choose between electric and natural gas heaters. Electric models are safer for kids around the pool. Gas heaters provide faster heating but need proper ventilation. Check local regulations regarding pool heating equipment. 


### Installation Requirements

Basic models attach directly to the pool and plug into a standard electrical outlet. More powerful heaters require dedicated circuit breakers and proper wiring. Consider professional installation for gas heaters to ensure safety and optimal performance. 

![Intex-Pool-Heater-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Intex-Pool-Heater-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Operating Costs and Efficiency

Electric heaters typically run between $1-2 per hour, while gas heaters cost $0.25-0.50 per hour. Look for models with high BTU ratings and good reviews for better efficiency. Insulate your pool and maintain proper chemical balance to reduce heating costs. 


## FAQ

![Intex-Pool-Heater-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Intex-Pool-Heater-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What size Intex pool heater do I need?

Pool heater size requirements vary based on factors like pool volume, desired heating capacity, and local climate. Common sizes range from 1.25 to 2.5 million BTUs, but proper sizing requires calculating your pool's surface area and considering local temperature extremes. 

A general rule of thumb is to allow 15,000 BTUs per 100 square feet of pool surface area. For example, a 16x40-foot pool would need approximately 240,000 BTUs to maintain a comfortable swimming temperature on cooler days. 


### How long do Intex pool heaters typically last?

With regular maintenance, Intex pool heaters usually last between 5 to 10 years. Factors affecting longevity include usage frequency, operating conditions, and adherence to maintenance schedules. 

Common indicators of impending failure include increased energy consumption, reduced heating efficiency, and leakage issues. Regular inspection of components like heat exchangers and control panels helps identify potential problems before they become major issues. 

![Intex-Pool-Heater-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Intex-Pool-Heater-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What's the difference between gas and electric Intex pool heaters?

Gas heaters (usually propane or natural gas) heat water more efficiently and can raise pool temperature more quickly than electric heaters. They're ideal for larger pools or areas with higher outdoor temperatures. 

Electric heaters, while generally less powerful, are more practical for small pools (under 2000 gallons) or as a supplemental heat source. They're also safer for unenclosed installations and work well in coastal areas with mild winters. 


### How much do Intex pool heaters cost to run?

The operating cost depends heavily on fuel type, pool size, and local energy rates. Propane heaters typically run between $0.15 and $0.30 per gallon, while natural gas heaters cost approximately $0.05 per therm (each therm = 100,000 BTUs). 

For a 20,000-gallon pool, maintaining a temperature of 80°F can cost between $150 and $300 per month during colder months, using an average of 1.5 to 3.0 million BTUs per day. Actual costs vary based on local climate and usage patterns. 

![Intex-Pool-Heater-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Intex-Pool-Heater-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How much do Intex pool heaters cost?

Entry-level Intex gas heaters range from $500 to $800, while electric models start around $400. High-efficiency models and those with additional features like automatic water balancing systems cost between $800 and $1,500. 

Installation costs vary significantly based on existing pool equipment and local labor rates. A basic gas heater installation typically costs $500 to $1,000, while more complex systems may require $1,500 to $3,000 or more. 


### What maintenance do Intex pool heaters need?

Regular maintenance includes checking fuel lines for leaks, ensuring proper water flow through the heat exchanger, and cleaning or replacing filters. The heat exchanger should be inspected annually for corrosion or damage. 

Service the control board and electrical components yearly, and drain and check the fuel tank for sediment buildup. Keep detailed maintenance records to spot trends and schedule timely repairs before major failures occur.
