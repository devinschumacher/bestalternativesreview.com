## Buyer's Guide

Frette towels are renowned for their exceptional quality and luxurious feel. These towels combine superior absorbency with remarkable softness, making them a premium choice for both home and hotel use. Understanding their key features will help you select the right Frette towels for your needs. 


### Material Quality

Authentic Frette towels are made from long-staple cotton, which contributes to their plush texture and increased durability. The company's proprietary Frette Cotton technology enhances the material's properties through specialized treatments and weaving techniques. Higher thread counts typically indicate better quality and softer towels, though this varies by the specific towel design. 


### Construction and Design

Look for towels with even stitching and consistent thickness. Higher-end Frette towels often feature double-needle construction at hems and edges, which improves durability and adds a professional touch. The company offers a wide range of designs, from solid colors to intricate patterns, so consider your aesthetic preferences when selecting a style. 


### Size and Usage

Towel sizes vary significantly between different Frette products, so measure your existing towels or consider their intended use. Bath towels typically range from 60x120 inches for bath mats to 100x200 inches for oversized beach towels. Hand towels usually measure around 18x28 inches, while face cloths are smaller still. 


### Care Requirements

Most Frette towels can be machine washed, but follow specific care instructions based on the design. Some towels require dry cleaning or special handling. The company recommends using mild detergents and cold water washing to maintain the towels' quality. Proper drying techniques, such as air drying when possible, will extend the life of your towels and maintain their texture. 


## FAQ


### What sets Frette towels apart from other luxury towels?

Frette towels stand out in the luxury market through their exceptional quality and attention to detail. Their towels are made from the finest Turkish cotton, known for its long fibers that create a more durable and absorbent fabric. The weaving process uses cotton loops that are twice as long as standard towels, resulting in increased thickness and plushness. 

The manufacturing process, which takes place in Frette's family-owned factory in Como, Italy, incorporates traditional techniques passed down through generations. Each towel is crafted to exceed industry standards, with extra attention paid to stitching and finishing to prevent fraying and ensure long-lasting quality. 


### How should Frette towels be cared for to maintain their quality?

To preserve the quality and appearance of Frette towels, it's important to follow their specific care instructions. The towels perform well in both washing machines and hand washing, with a recommended wash cycle of 28Â° to 30Â°C (82Â° to 86Â°F) in a gentle cycle. For hand washing, avoid using harsh detergents and instead use mild, neutral soap. 

Air drying is recommended to prevent shrinking and maintain texture. If machine drying is necessary, use a low heat setting or air dry and reshape while slightly damp. Regular maintenance includes turning the towels inside out before washing and using a mesh laundry bag to prevent pills and damage during the cycle. 


### What are the different styles available in Frette's towel collection?

The Frette towel collection offers a variety of styles to suit different needs and preferences. The most popular styles include traditional Turkish towels with a rope hem, which are especially plush and absorbent, and the banded edges found in their premium towels, which add a touch of refined detail. 

Color options range from neutral tones like white and ivory to rich shades such as navy and burgundy. The collection also includes matching sets of hand towels and bathrobes, allowing for coordinated bathroom linens. 


### How do Frette towels compare in price to similar luxury brands?

While Frette towels command a premium price point, they generally compare favorably in cost compared to other luxury towel brands. Their pricing structure reflects the higher quality materials and labor-intensive manufacturing process. 

On average, a Frette Turkish towel sells for $150 to $250, while a matching bathrobe and hand towel set ranges from $250 to $500. This price range aligns with other premium luxury towel brands, making Frette competitive in the high-end market. 


### What sizes are available for Frette towels?

Frette offers standard and extra-long sizes for their towels, with specific dimensions varying by style. Standard bath towels measure approximately 60 inches by 110 inches, while extra-long versions extend to 70 inches by 130 inches. They also provide hand towels in regular and extended lengths, matching each bath towel style. 

Additional sizes like face towels and kids' towels can be special ordered, though standard sets typically include the most commonly requested sizes. 


### Can Frette towels be monogrammed?

Frette offers monogramming services for their towels, allowing customers to personalize their linens with family names or initials. The monogramming process is done through their official website or at select retail locations. 

Monogramming is available on most styles, including Turkish towels, hand towels, and bathrobes. The service is typically priced between $20 and $30 per item, with standard turnaround time of 1-2 weeks.
