This quirky adult-sized alien costume transforms you into an extraterrestrial presence with its fan-powered inflation that makes you feel like you're floating through space. The one-size-fits-all design, while slightly long at the legs, manages to stay put with its elastic ankles, though you might want to grab an extra set of AA batteries – you'll want to keep the cool breeze going during those long nights out. The black, blue, and lime green design might be a bit hit-or-miss on quality (one reviewer's zipper failed completely), but for the most part, it delivers on its promise of drawing attention and sparking conversation wherever you go.

## Buyer's Guide

Looking for a fun addition to your camping trip or backyard barbecue? Consider getting an inflatable alien - these quirky inflatables can transform any outdoor space into a memorable adventure zone. Whether you're planning a themed party or just want a conversation starter, there are several factors to consider when selecting the right inflatable alien for your needs. 


### Size and Proportion

Inflatable aliens come in various sizes, from small tabletop versions to large backyard installations. The right size depends on your available space and intended use. Keep in mind that larger inflatables are more noticeable but also require more storage space when deflated. 


### Material Quality

The durability of an inflatable alien is directly related to the quality of its material. Look for products made from PVC or TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane) which are more resistant to punctures and UV damage. The thickness of the material should be at least 0.4mm for outdoor use. 


### Setup and Storage

Consider how easy the inflatable will be to set up and store. Some models come with built-in sand bags or stakes for stability, while others require additional weighting. The storage bag should be robust to protect the inflatable during transit and between uses. 


### Power Source

Inflatable aliens typically require an inflation unit to maintain their shape. AC-powered units are more convenient for indoor use or well-sheltered outdoor locations, while battery-operated units are ideal for camping or unsheltered areas. Consider the power consumption of the unit to ensure compatibility with your power source. 


## FAQ


### What makes an Inflatable Alien unique?

Inflatable aliens combine lightweight materials with clever engineering to create memorable companions that double as versatile storage solutions. Their designs blend cartoonish charm with practicality, making them popular additions to both indoor and outdoor spaces. 

Each inflatable alien features durable PVC construction and detailed sculpting that brings their extraterrestrial features to life. They typically inflate to a size between 3-6 feet tall, depending on the specific model you choose. 


### Are inflatable aliens suitable for all weather conditions?

While most inflatable aliens are designed to withstand light rain and occasional sun exposure, they're best kept out of direct sunlight and heavy storms. It's important to store them properly when not in use to maintain their longevity. 

During storage, deflate the alien completely and roll it up with the included straps. Store it in a cool, dry place away from sharp objects that could damage the PVC material. 


### How do inflatable aliens compare to other storage solutions?

Unlike traditional storage bins, inflatable aliens use space more efficiently by inflating to full size only when needed. They're particularly effective for maximizing vertical storage in closets, garages, or under beds. 

Compared to wall-mounted storage systems, inflatable aliens offer better protection for your items because they completely enclose the storage space. However, they may not provide as much structured support for heavy objects as dedicated storage containers. 


### What sizes are available for inflatable aliens?

Inflatable aliens come in various sizes to suit different storage needs. Common dimensions range from small models around 3 feet tall, which are ideal for shoes or small items, to larger ones reaching 6 feet tall, suitable for seasonal clothing or camping equipment. 

Most manufacturers offer a few standard heights, while some larger retailers may stock additional sizes upon request. Always measure your available space before selecting a specific model to ensure a perfect fit. 


### How frequently should inflatable aliens be inflated and deflated?

For optimal longevity, it's best to inflate your alien at least once every three months. This regular use helps maintain the material's elasticity and prevents it from becoming stiff when inflated. 

Deflation isn't necessary for daily storage but should be done when the alien isn't in regular use for extended periods, such as during extreme temperature changes or storage in humid environments. 


### What maintenance is required for inflatable aliens?

Regular maintenance for inflatable aliens consists of occasional inspection for any tears or loose seams. Use mild soap and water to clean the surface, avoiding harsh chemicals that could damage the PVC. 

Always ensure the alien is completely dry before storing it, as moisture can cause mildew. If a tear is found, contact the manufacturer for replacement instructions - typically, punctures larger than 1 inch need replacement.
