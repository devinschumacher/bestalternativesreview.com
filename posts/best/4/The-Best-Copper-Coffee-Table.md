## Buyer's Guide

A copper coffee table adds warmth and texture to any living room. Understanding the right size, material quality, and maintenance requirements will help you select a piece that matches your style and needs. 


### Size and Proportion

Select a coffee table that's approximately 18-24 inches shorter than your sofa's length for ideal proportion. The width should be one-third to one-half of the sofa's length to maintain balance. Consider leaving a 12-18 inch gap between the table and the sofa for ease of movement. 


### Material Quality and Construction

Copper coffee tables come in various gauges, with thicker pieces (16-18 gauge) being more durable. Look for tables with solid copper construction rather than bonded copperComposite materials, which may peel or flake over time. The copper surface should have a consistent thickness throughout


### Maintenance Requirements

Care for copper coffee tables with a soft cloth and mild cleaning solution several times a year to remove dust and mineral deposits. Avoid abrasive cleaners or steel wool, which can damage the surface. Polishing the table with a specialized copper polish can restore its shine and protection. 


### Style and Finish Options

Copper coffee tables can be found in various styles, from sleek modern designs to ornate traditional pieces. Common finish options include raw copper, which patinas over time, and antiqued copper, which has a darker, more weathered appearance. Consider the finish's durability and maintenance requirements when selecting a table
