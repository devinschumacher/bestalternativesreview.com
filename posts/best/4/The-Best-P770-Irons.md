## FAQ


### What makes the P770 Irons unique compared to other high-end irons on the market?

Designed for serious golfers, the P770 Irons combine advanced construction techniques with precise muscle-memory shaping. The forged face and milled sole deliver optimal ball control and consistent distance, while the engineered flex patterns in the sole enhance turf interaction and turf feel. 

Key differences include a more pronounced draw-bias through a single continuous crown and a unique face slot design that creates an illusion of increased width at address, helping golfers achieve their desired ball flight more confidently. 


### How do the P770 Irons compare in performance to the brand's previous iron models?

The P770 Irons represent a significant advancement over their predecessor, the P710. Golfers report increased ball speed, better consistency, and improved forgiveness across the face. The new slot design and continuous crown also receive high marks for their visual appeal and alignment assistance. 

Performance testing shows an average 7% increase in ball speed at impact, along with improved spin rates for enhanced control. The overall feedback points to a more forgiving and versatile iron set compared to the previous model. 


### What are the main technical specifications of the P770 Irons?

Each iron features a stainless steel face milled from a single piece of 1020 Japanese steel. The club crown is forged from 283 stainless steel, while the sole plate and hosel are crafted from 17-4 stainless steel for durability and consistency. 

Standard lofts range from 46° for the 3-iron to 64° for the pitching wedge, with a 58° gap wedge and a 66° lob wedge also available. The lofts are designed for modern swing dynamics, with slightly stronger lofts than traditional sets for most players. 


### Which P770 Irons would you recommend for a mid-to-high handicapper?

The 3-iron through 7-iron are particularly well-suited for mid-handicappers due to their forgiving design and versatile performance. The 3-iron's larger size and extra bounce help with ball-striking, while the shorter irons maintain solid feel and control. 

Many golfers find the 5-iron to 7-iron most beneficial, as they provide the right balance of distance and control for improving players. These clubs consistently receive praise for their consistent ball flight and reliable performance across the board. 


### What maintenance requirements should I expect for my P770 Irons?

The P770 Irons benefit from basic maintenance common to all irons. The stainless steel faces resist corrosion, but regular cleaning with a soft brush and mild soap is recommended. The milled finish may require more frequent care than cheaper forgings, so using a dedicated golf club cleaner is advisable. 

Inspect the grooves regularly for wear, and consider having them professionally recast if extensive damage occurs. The clubs should be protected from extreme temperature changes and humidity to maintain their finish and performance characteristics. 


### Are the P770 Irons available in different club lengths and shaft options?

The standard P770 Irons come with Fujikura MJ Pro Tour shafts in regular, stiff, and senior flex options. While customization is possible, the factory settings are designed to optimize performance across different swing speeds and styles. 

Club lengths range from 36.5 inches for the 3-iron to 34.5 inches for the pitching wedge, with a 66° lob wedge measuring 33.5 inches. The consistent length progression helps maintain balance and swing tempo when transitioning between clubs.
