## Buyer's Guide

A Kennedy Tool Box is a specialized storage solution designed to keep your tools organized and accessible. These durable containers are built to withstand the rigors of professional use while providing ample space for various toolsets. 


### Capacity and Size Options

The primary factor in choosing a Kennedy Tool Box is the amount of space you need for your tools. Consider the total number and size of your tools when selecting the box's dimensions. Kennedy offers multiple size options, from compact travel cases to large stationary units, allowing you to match the box's capacity to your specific needs. 


### MATERIALS AND CONSTRUCTION

Quality construction is crucial for a tool box that will be regularly subjected to impact and wear. Kennedy Tool Boxes are typically made from high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or aluminum, both of which offer excellent durability and resistance to scratches and corrosion.

Kennedy offers various modular systems, including tool trays, pegboards, and dividers, which can be customized to fit your specific tool arrangement. These organizational features help prevent tools from getting lost or damaged within the box. 


### PORTABILITY AND USAGE

For versatile tool management, consider the box's accessibility features. Wheels and handle attachments make it easier to move heavy tool collections across job sites or from vehicle to workspace. The lid configuration should also facilitate quick tool access, whether you prefer a straight lid or one with a built-in tool tray for easy reach.
