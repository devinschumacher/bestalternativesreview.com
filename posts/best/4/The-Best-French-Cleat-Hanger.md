While the cleats are decently strong, users note they're engineered to support the weight rather than relying on hidden screws. 


## Buyer's Guide

A French cleat hanger provides an elegant solution for mounting heavy items while maintaining a slim profile. Understanding its key components and applications will help you select the right type for your needs. 


### Essential Components

A French cleat consists of two pieces: a rail and a cleat. The rail mounts to the wall, featuring a flat surface that can be flush-mounted or jutting out slightly. The cleat connects to your item and attaches to the rail using a hinge. The included mounting hardware ensures proper alignment and stability. 


### Size and Load Capacity

Size matters when choosing a French cleat hanger. The rail length should accommodate the item's width, plus additional space for visual appeal. Load capacity varies by design and material, so select a system rated for your item's weight. Always consider the combined weight of all hanging items when evaluating capacity. 


### Installation Requirements

French cleat hangers require appropriate wall anchoring, such as expanding bolts or molly bolts, depending on your wall type and local building codes. The rail's mounting system should match your wall material (drywall, stud wall, etc. ). Consider the wall's proximity to corners or edges, as they may limit installation options. 


### Design Considerations

Mounting profile affects both appearance and functionality. Flat-mounted cleats create a more modern look but require more wall space. Exposed-mount systems use less wall space but can be less visually appealing. Choose a system that matches your room's architectural style and available space. Consider the cleat's finished appearance and whether it's visible or flush-mounted with your item. 


## FAQ


### What is a French cleat hanger?

A French cleat hanger is a type of wall-mounted cabinet hinge system designed for hanging heavy items like mirrors, frames, and artwork. It consists of two pieces: a T-shaped cleat that mounts to the wall and a matching piece that attaches to the back of the item being hung. 

The system works by transferring the weight from the item directly to the wall through the cleat, providing stable support for heavy loads. Unlike other hanging systems, French cleats distribute weight across the entire length of the cleat, making them ideal for large or heavy items. 


### How does a French cleat hanger work?

The mounting process begins with securing the wall plate to the wall using appropriate hardware. The second piece, with a matching mounting hole pattern, then attaches to the back of the item being hung. When aligned, the two pieces form a strong connection that supports the weight of the item. 

The key to proper installation is measuring and marking the wall accurately before drilling holes. The wall plate should be mounted with enough cleat depth to accommodate the item's weight and width, ensuring stability and safety. 


### What types of items can you hang with French cleat hangers?

French cleat hangers excel at supporting heavy, framed items like mirrors, paintings, and large photo frames. They're particularly useful for installations in areas with significant weight, such as over doors, above mantles, or in professional settings like offices and hotels. 

While they work best for framed items, French cleats can also support unframed art pieces and specialized items like picture frames with multiple points of mounting. Always consider the weight rating of your chosen cleat system before installation. 


### How do you measure for French cleat hangers?

To measure for French cleat hangers, first determine the weight of the item you're hanging. Next, measure the width and height of the frame or item. This information helps determine the appropriate cleat length and mounting requirements. 

For precise measurements, measure from the outer edges of the frame, including any glass or backing material. This ensures the cleat has enough width to secure the entire piece and distribute weight effectively. 


### What is the typical weight capacity of French cleat hangers?

French cleat hangers typically support between 50-200 pounds per pair, depending on the specific system and backing material used. Heavier capacities are available for professional installations. 

Always check the manufacturer's specifications for the exact weight rating of your chosen cleat system. Factors like mounting material, wall type, and cleat depth affect the maximum safe load. 


### How do you install French cleat hangers?

Installation requires measuring, marking, and drilling pilot holes for wall plates. Align the wall plate with the marks, then secure it with appropriate hardware. Attach the second piece to the back of the item being hung, aligning mounting holes before tightening. 

Professional installation is recommended for heavy loads or structural applications. Always use proper safety equipment and follow manufacturer guidelines to ensure secure, stable mounting.
