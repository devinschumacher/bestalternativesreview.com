## Buyer's Guide

Hermes plates combine durability with elegant design, making them a popular choice for both casual and formal dining. Understanding key aspects of their construction and care requirements will help you select the right plates for your needs. 


### Material Quality

Look for plates made from durable materials that resist chipping and scratching. Common quality materials include ceramic with a strong glaze, porcelain for its fine texture, and stoneware for everyday use. Higher-quality plates often have a slightly heavier weight and more refined finish. 


### Size and Shape Options

Standard dinner plates range from 9 to 10 inches in diameter, while salad plates are typically 6 to 8 inches. Consider whether you need specific shapes for different courses (e. g. , soup bowls, dessert plates) or if a uniform style works best for your setting. The plate's shape affects how well it holds food and how it fits in your tableware collection. 


### Durability and Maintenance

Check the plate's resistance to thermal shock and everyday wear. Look for pieces that can go directly from microwave to dishwasher without damage. Plates rated for oven use offer added versatility, though they may be heavier and more costly. 

Consider the ease of maintenance when selecting plate materials. Glass plates are dishwasher safe but may be more fragile, while ceramic and stoneware typically require hand washing for their best appearance. 


### Decorative Elements

Hermes plates often feature intricate designs or patterns. While decorative elements add visual interest, they can also impact cleaning and maintenance. Plates with raised or detailed designs may collect more food residue and show scratches more prominently. 

Consider your personal style preference and how the plate's design will complement your existing tableware collection. Some patterns are more suitable for formal dining, while simpler designs work well in both casual and formal settings.
