## FAQ


### What is Fresh Cab?

Fresh Cab revolutionizes the way you measure and control your indoor farm's environment, featuring precise CO2 monitoring and control capabilities. It's designed for greenhouse and indoor farm applications where optimal growing conditions are critical. 

By maintaining ideal CO2 levels, Fresh Cab helps plants grow faster and more efficiently, leading to increased yields and better quality produce. The system integrates seamlessly with existing climate control equipment to create a fully automated growing environment. 


### How accurate is the CO2 measurement?

The Fresh Cab CO2 sensor is highly accurate within a range of 0-5000 ppm, with measurement precision of ±20 ppm. This level of accuracy ensures that your plants receive the exact CO2 levels needed for optimal growth. 

The sensor undergoes regular calibration to maintain its accuracy, and the system prompts users when recalibration is needed. Optional on-site calibration kits are available for users who prefer to adjust the sensor themselves. 


### Is Fresh Cab compatible with existing climate control systems?

Yes, Fresh Cab is designed to integrate with most climate control systems, including HVAC, ventilation, and CO2 generators. The system includes modbus outputs and relays to control and monitor connected equipment. 

Installation typically requires minimal modifications to your existing setup. The system's installation guide provides detailed instructions for connecting Fresh Cab to your climate control equipment. 


### What is the power consumption of Fresh Cab?

Fresh Cab operates on standard AC power, consuming approximately 25 watts continuously. In standby mode, the power consumption drops to just 2 watts, making it energy-efficient for long-term use. 

The system includes a power management feature that automatically switches to standby mode when CO2 concentrations are stable, further reducing power consumption and costs. 


### How does Fresh Cab maintain optimal humidity levels?

While Fresh Cab primarily focuses on CO2 measurement and control, it works in conjunction with your existing climate control equipment to manage humidity levels. The system's integrated fan control adjusts ventilation based on CO2 levels, which also affects the relative humidity in your growing environment. 

For precise humidity control, consider using the Fresh Cab system in combination with a separate humidity sensor and controller. Many users report achieving optimal humidity levels between 40-60% when using this approach. 


### What maintenance requirements does Fresh Cab have?

Regular maintenance includes checking the CO2 sensor and replacing the filter every 6 months. The sensor should be calibrated annually using the on-site calibration kit, or more frequently if the system detects drift in CO2 readings. 

The system's display and control panel need occasional cleaning to prevent dust buildup. The power switch and relay contacts should be cleaned yearly to ensure reliable operation.
