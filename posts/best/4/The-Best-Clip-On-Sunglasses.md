## Buyer's Guide

Clip-on sunglasses are a convenient way to enhance your sun protection without committing to full-frame glasses. These attachments clip onto your existing eyewear, offering style and flexibility. Understanding the key features will help you select the right pair for your needs. 


### Ergonomic Fit and Comfort

Look for clip-ons with a secure, comfortable fit that doesn't cause pressure points or slide during wear. The frame should sit snugly on the temples of your base glasses without requiring constant readjustment.

### UV Protection and Lens Quality

Ensure the clip-ons provide 100% UV protection with lenses meeting ANSI Z80.3 standards. The material should be durable, with impact-resistant lenses available for high-impact sports or active lifestyles. 


### Size Compatibility and Coverage

Check the frame size compatibility with your base glasses to achieve proper coverage. Larger frames offer broader protection but may not fit all styles of eyewear. Consider the frame shape that best matches your face shape for optimal aesthetics and protection.

The clip mechanism should be secure yet easy to attach and remove. Consider models with protective features like scratch-resistant coatings, polarized lenses, or built-in windscreen technology for enhanced comfort during outdoor activities. 


## FAQ

![Clip-On-Sunglasses-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Clip-On-Sunglasses-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are clip-on sunglasses and how do they work?

Clip-on sunglasses are a type of sunglasses that attach to your regular glasses or spectacles. They typically consist of a clip that mounts to the bridge of your glasses, holding the sunglasses in place while you adjust the lenses to your preferred position. 

The clip mechanism provides an easy way to switch between regular glasses and sunglasses without the hassle of removing or storing a separate pair of glasses. 


### What materials are clip-on sunglasses made from?

Clip-on sunglasses are usually made from lightweight materials like plastic or metal to ensure comfort when worn with glasses. The lenses themselves can be made from various materials such as polarized glass or plastic, depending on the brand and model. 

The clip mechanism is typically made from metal for durability, though some manufacturers offer plastic clips as well. Both materials are available in different finishes and designs to match your glasses and personal style.

### Can I wear clip-on sunglasses with any glasses?

Most clip-on sunglasses are designed to work with glasses that have a standard bridge width of between 12-22mm. However, some models have adjustable clips that can accommodate a wider range of glasses. 

For the best fit, check your glasses' bridge width and verify compatibility with the specific clip-on model you're considering. Some brands also offer universal clips that work with most glasses. 


### How do I properly maintain my clip-on sunglasses?

Clean your clip-on sunglasses regularly using a soft, microfiber cloth to remove dust and dirt. For tougher stains, use a mild soap and water solution, avoiding harsh chemicals that might damage the lenses or clip. 

Store your clip-ons in a protective case when not in use to prevent scratches and damage. The clip should be kept closed to prevent wear and maintain its shape. 

![Clip-On-Sunglasses-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Clip-On-Sunglasses-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Are clip-on sunglasses effective during bright conditions?

Clip-on sunglasses work best during moderate to bright conditions, providing protection from UV rays and reducing glare. They may not be suitable for very intense sunlight or direct sunlight reflected off water or snow. 

Choose polarized lenses if you're concerned about glare, as they perform best in these conditions. Most clip-ons offer protection similar to regular sunglasses, just in a more portable package. 


### How long do clip-on sunglasses typically last?

Clip-on sunglasses usually last between 1-3 years with regular use, depending on the quality of the materials and how well they're maintained. The clip mechanism tends to show wear first, often needing replacement after 1-2 years. 

Higher-quality clip-on sunglasses made from durable materials may last longer, while cheaper models might need replacement after one year due to frequent use and clip wear.
