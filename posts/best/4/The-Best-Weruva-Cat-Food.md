## FAQ


### What are the benefits of Weruva's canned cat food?

Weruva's canned cat food stands out with its high-quality ingredients and natural flavors. Each meal is crafted using real meat as the first ingredient, free from artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives, ensuring your cat receives a nutritionally balanced meal that tastes like the real thing. 

The moist formula helps maintain your cat's hydration levels, supports urinary health, and aids in maintaining a healthy weight. The convenient serving size of 3-4 oz per meal makes it ideal for cats with controlled portion needs. 


### Can I rotate different Weruva flavors in my cat's diet?

Yes, Weruva's variety of flavors allows you to mix and match based on your cat's preferences. Rotating flavors can keep your cat's meals interesting and help prevent food boredom, which can lead to better appetite and engagement during mealtime. 

However, when introducing new flavors, do so gradually to prevent digestive upset. Monitor your cat's reaction to any new food and consult with your vet if you notice changes in behavior or health. 


### What is Weruva's natural recipe process?

Weruva's natural recipe process focuses on preserving the nutritional integrity of each ingredient through gentle cooking methods. They steam or low-heat cook their ingredients, locking in important nutrients while maintaining a fresh, appetizing texture. 

This process allows them to use whole ingredients without adding artificial preservatives, resulting in meals that closely replicate a raw diet while being practical for everyday feeding. 


### Are Weruva products suitable for kittens?

While Weruva's regular canned food can be given to kittens, many owners choose to start them on a nutritionally balanced kitten formula specifically designed to meet their higher energy and growth needs. Check with your veterinarian to determine the best starting diet for your kitten. 

If starting with adult food, gradually transition your kitten over a period of 7-10 days to prevent digestive upset. Monitor their growth and consult your vet if you notice any changes in weight or development. 


### How should I store Weruva canned food?

Unopened cans of Weruva cat food should be stored in a cool, dry place, like a pantry or cabinet, away from direct sunlight. Once opened, transfer the remaining food to an airtight container and keep it in the refrigerator, using it within 3-4 days for maximum freshness. 

Always check the food's appearance and odor before serving. If it looks cloudy, has an off smell, or shows signs of spoilage, discard it and prepare a fresh serving. 


### Can Weruva food cause sensitive stomach issues?

While Weruva cat food is highly nutritious and natural, some cats may still experience sensitivity issues when transitioning to new foods. The primary ingredients (like chicken, turkey, or salmon) can be challenging for cats with specific food sensitivities. 

Start with small amounts of a new flavor, gradually increasing over several days. Watch for signs of digestive upset like vomiting, diarrhea, or loss of appetite. If problems occur, return to the previous diet and consult your veterinarian.
