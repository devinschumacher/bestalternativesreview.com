## FAQ


### What is gold foil paper?

Gold foil paper consists of a thin layer of metallic gold applied to a substrate such as plastic film or paper. It can be used for crafting, packaging, or creating decorative elements. 

The thickness and quality of gold foil paper vary, with some products featuring a heavier gold layer for more substantial coverage. 


### How is gold foil paper different from gold leaf?

### What are the best substrates for gold foil paper?

Common substrates include cardstock, wood, plastic, and fabric. The substrate's surface texture and material properties affect the foil's adhesion and final appearance. 

For best results, substrates should be clean, dry, and smooth. Textured surfaces may require additional preparation or an adhesive.
