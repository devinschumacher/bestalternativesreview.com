### What is a Bluetooth coffee maker?

A Bluetooth coffee maker is a smart coffee machine that connects to your smartphone via Bluetooth. This allows you to control brewing settings, receive brewing status updates, and monitor your coffee's progress from anywhere in your home. 

These coffee makers typically feature an app that lets you customize brewing profiles, schedule automatic brewing, and track your coffee consumption habits.

These settings give you flexibility to fine-tune your coffee to your taste preferences, whether you prefer a strong morning brew or a milder afternoon cup.
