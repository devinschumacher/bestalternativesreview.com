### What is a Bluetooth coffee maker?

A Bluetooth coffee maker is a smart coffee machine that connects to your smartphone via Bluetooth. This allows you to control brewing settings, receive brewing status updates, and monitor your coffee's progress from anywhere in your home. 

These coffee makers typically feature an app that lets you customize brewing profiles, schedule automatic brewing, and track your coffee consumption habits. 


### How do I connect my Bluetooth coffee maker to my smartphone?

Connecting is straightforward. First, ensure Bluetooth is enabled on your phone and coffee maker. Then, open the coffee maker's app and select 'Add New Device. ' Follow the on-screen instructions to pair your phone with the coffee maker.

These settings give you flexibility to fine-tune your coffee to your taste preferences, whether you prefer a strong morning brew or a milder afternoon cup.
