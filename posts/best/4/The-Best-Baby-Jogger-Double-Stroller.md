## Buyer's Guide

A double stroller allows you to bring both your children out comfortably, but with so many options available, choosing the right one can be overwhelming. This guide helps you understand the key features and considerations to ensure you select a stroller that meets your needs and lifestyle. 


### Capacity and Configuration

Double strollers come in various configurations - tandem (two seats in a single file), side-by-side (two seats side by side), and convertibles (that can switch between the two configurations). Tandem strollers are great for bringing older siblings along, while side-by-side models provide more legroom and independence for both children. Convertible models offer the most flexibility.

### Size and Foldability

The compactness of a stroller is crucial for storage and transport. Look for strollers that fold small enough to fit in your vehicle and can be stored easily at home. The folding mechanism should be reliable and quick to use, especially when you're in a hurry or need to store the stroller in tight spaces. 


### Ride Quality and Storage

The quality of the ride is essential for both you and your children. Key factors include smooth-rolling wheels, adjustable seats with adequate padding, and full five-point harnesses. Consider strollers with a reclining feature for newborns and good storage options for shopping bags, diaper changes, and blankets.

### Weight and Upright Stability

While weight affects portability, very lightweight strollers may sacrifice stability when fully loaded with gear. Look for a stroller that feels balanced and secure when fully loaded, with robust wheels that can handle various terrains. The pushing handle should remain stable and responsive while walking.
