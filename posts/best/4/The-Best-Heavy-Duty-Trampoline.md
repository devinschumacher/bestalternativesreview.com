## Buyer's Guide

A heavy duty trampoline combines durable construction with resilient springs to provide an intense workout and endless entertainment. When selecting one, consider the following key factors to ensure you choose a quality product that fits your needs. 


### Frame Material and Design

The frame is the trampoline's backbone, so choose a model with a robust steel construction. Galvanized steel offers excellent corrosion resistance, while welded joints provide superior strength compared to bolted connections. Consider the frame design - square or rectangular frames distribute weight more evenly than circular alternatives, reducing stress on the springs and padding. 


### Springs and Bounce Quality

Heavy duty trampolines use thicker steel springs ranging from 14 to 18 gauge. The number of springs also impacts performance - models with 180 or more springs provide a more consistent bounce. Check for quality spring coatings that prevent wear and rust, with double-braided spring encasements offering the best protection. 


### Padding and Safety Features

Comprehensive safety protection starts with a thick, impact-absorbing pad covering the entire frame. Look for top-quality pads with a minimum 1-inch foam core and premium TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane) covering. Additional safety features include safety grids around the edges, protective foot pads under springs, and ground anchors to secure the trampoline against wind and movement. 


### Size and Placement Requirements

While larger trampolines offer more jumping space, they require more room for safety. Calculate the minimum clear space needed - the recommended distance is 20 feet in all directions for standard trampolines. Check the weight capacity and intended user age range to ensure the trampoline is appropriate for your intended users while maintaining proper usage guidelines. 


## FAQ
