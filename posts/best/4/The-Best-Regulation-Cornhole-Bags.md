## Buyer's Guide

Regulation cornhole bags are a crucial component of competitive cornhole play, featuring specific dimensions and construction requirements to ensure fairness and consistent gameplay. Understanding these requirements helps casual players transition to competitive play and ensures that all competitors use legally-sized bags. 


### Dimensions

Official regulation bags measure 2.5 inches in diameter (6.35 cm) and are 12 inches tall when placed in the bag launcher, though this height can vary outside the launcher. These standardized measurements ensure that all bags compete at the same level, preventing unfair advantages from overly large or small bags.

### Materials

Bags should be made from lightweight materials like plastic or engineered foam to maintain consistent flight characteristics and reduce wear on the playing surface. Premium bags often incorporate durable yet light materials that resist damage from regular use while maintaining the proper size and shape. 


### Construction Quality

High-quality bags are typically constructed with reinforced stitching at key points, such as the bottom seam and the launcher attachment point. The stitching should be tight and straight to prevent unraveling during use. The bags should also feature a secure closure system to prevent contents from shifting or spilling.

### Including Pockets

While standard regulation bags do not include pockets, some advanced models incorporate small storage pouches for additional accessories like bean bags or scoring tokens. These pouches must be securely sewn and positioned to prevent interference with bag placement or flight. 


## FAQ

![Regulation-Cornhole-Bags-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Regulation-Cornhole-Bags-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What sets regulation cornhole bags apart from standard ones?

Regulation cornhole bags are designed to meet official size and weight specifications, ensuring fair play in competitive games. These bags typically weigh between 16-20 ounces and measure 11-12 inches long by 6-7 inches wide, with a 2-inch diameter base. 

Professional-grade bags are made from high-density polyethylene or similar materials that resist tearing and maintain their shape. The bags have reinforced stitching at the base for durability during gameplay. 


### How do I properly store cornhole bags?

Cornhole bags should be stored in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight to prevent material degradation. Keeping them in original packaging or protective bags helps maintain their shape and integrity. 

Before storage, allow the bags to air dry if they become wet. Avoid folding them sharply, especially near the stitching, as this can cause stress fractures. Instead, roll them loosely or store in a bag with soft protective padding.

### What should I consider when selecting regulation cornhole bags?

Choose bags that meet the official size and weight specifications for your region. Consider the material quality, stitching durability, and bag design that suits your playing style (e. g. , traditional vs. padded seams). 

Look for bags with manufacturers' warranties, which often indicate a commitment to quality and longevity. Consider purchasing bags in pairs to maintain consistent weight distribution during gameplay. 


### Can I wash regulation cornhole bags with regular household items?

Yes, you can wash regulation cornhole bags with regular household items. Use a mild soap and lukewarm water to clean dirt and grime from the surface of the bag. Avoid using bleach or harsh detergents, which can damage the material. 

Always check the care label on your specific bag, as some manufacturers may have specific instructions. For air-drying, hang the bag by one corner or lay it flat to prevent distorted shape memory.
