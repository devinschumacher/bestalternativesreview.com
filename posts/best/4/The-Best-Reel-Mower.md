## Buyer's Guide

A reel mower, also known as a cylinder mower, is an efficient alternative to electric or gas-powered mowers, using a series of blades to cut grass. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the right reel mower for your lawn care needs. 


### Deck Width and Cutting Capacity

The deck width determines the mower's cutting swath. Common widths range from 12 to 24 inches, with wider decks for larger lawns. Consider the size of your lawn and the amount of grass you need to cut regularly. 


### Blade Quality and Quantity

Reel mowers typically have 4 to 12 blades. More blades generally mean smoother cuts and finer grass. Look for blades made from durable materials like stainless steel to ensure long-term performance. 


### Height Adjustment Mechanism

The cutting height should be adjustable in 1/10 to 1/8 inch increments. A wider range allows for more precise trimming, while a mechanism that's easy to adjust makes it practical for regular use. 


### Maintenance Requirements

Regular maintenance is crucial for reel mower performance. The blades need sharpening every 25 to 50 hours of use, and the mower should be cleaned and lubricated quarterly. Consider how involved these tasks are when selecting a model. 


## FAQ


### What is a reel mower?

A reel mower, also known as a cylinder or push mower, consists of a blade cylinder mounted on a shaft. This blade cylinder cuts grass by rolling over it while the mower is pushed across the lawn. The cutting action is entirely mechanical, requiring no electricity or fuel. 

These mowers are designed to give a clean, precise cut similar to professional-quality mowers, making them a popular choice for lawns that require consistent, high-quality results. 


### What are the key benefits of using a reel mower?

Reel mowers operate without electricity or emissions, making them environmentally friendly and cost-effective. They're particularly effective for small to medium-sized lawns and can be adjusted to different heights for various grass types. 

These mowers typically require less maintenance than power mowers and can be owned for decades with proper care, making them a long-term investment that reduces ongoing maintenance costs. 


### What lawn conditions are best suited for reel mowers?

Reel mowers excel in lawns with uniformly cut grass. They work best on small to medium-sized plots with manageable slopes, and are particularly effective in areas with consistent grass height and density. 

These mowers are less suitable for large lawns, heavily overgrown areas, or lawns with significant slope variations, as they may require more effort to cut and may not achieve the same results as power mowers in these conditions. 


### How much effort is required to push a reel mower?

Pushing a reel mower requires more physical effort than using a power mower, as the cutting action is done manually. The amount of effort needed varies based on the lawn's condition, grass height, and mower quality. 

While some people find the exercise rewarding and enjoy the physical activity, others may prefer the convenience of power mowers, especially for larger or more challenging lawns. 


### What maintenance is required for a reel mower?

Regular maintenance for reel mowers includes sharpening the cutting blades, checking the wheel bearings, and cleaning the deck. The blade should be sharpened after every 10-12 hours of use or twice per season, depending on usage frequency. 

Additional maintenance tasks include greasing the shaft, inspecting the lawnmower's mounting for corrosion, and checking the tension of the cutting blades. Regular maintenance helps ensure optimal performance and extends the mower's lifespan. 


### Are reel mowers suitable for all grass types?

Reel mowers work best on cool-season grasses like Kentucky bluegrass, fescue, and ryegrass, which typically grow in regions with cooler temperatures. While they can handle most common grass types, they may struggle with extremely tall, coarse grasses like Bermuda or zoysia. 

These mowers are particularly effective on well-managed lawns with consistent grass height. They may not be suitable for lawns with weeds or tall grass that has overgrown significantly, as this can affect the mower's performance and cutting quality.
