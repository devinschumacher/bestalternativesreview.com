### Long-term Notes

When evaluating a Harry Styles Cologne, consider how well the scent maintains its character over time. Quality fragrances retain their identity for several hours, transitioning from strong to subtle rather than fading completely. 


## FAQ

![Harry-Styles-Cologne-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Harry-Styles-Cologne-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What scents are in Harry Styles' cologne?

Harry Styles' signature cologne combines top notes of bergamot and lemon with heart notes of rose and jasmine. The base includes amber, musk, and cedarwood, creating a warm, sophisticated scent profile. 

The fragrance family is classified as aromatic, leaning towards oriental with its rich blend of woody and floral elements. 


### What are the key notes in the scent?

The top notes include fresh citrus elements like bergamot and lemon, while the heart notes combine floral freshness with rose and jasmine. The base features warm, sensual elements of amber, musk, and cedarwood. 

The fragrance opens with zesty citrus, develops into a floral heart, and finishes with a rich woody base, lasting up to 6 hours on the skin. 

![Harry-Styles-Cologne-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Harry-Styles-Cologne-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How long does the fragrance last?

Harry Styles' cologne generally lasts between 4-6 hours when applied correctly. The longevity is influenced by factors such as the type of clothing worn, skin pH, and environmental conditions. 

After 6 hours, the core scent typically fades but leaves an invisible trail or "dry-down" that can last up to 12 hours. 


### What is the recommended application method?

For best results, apply the cologne to pulse points such as the wrists, neck, behind the ears, and the small of the back. Allow the product to absorb fully before dressing. 

A light application on pulse points is more effective than heavy spraying. Diffuse application creates a longer-lasting trail and prevents overwhelming concentrations. 

![Harry-Styles-Cologne-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Harry-Styles-Cologne-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What bottles and packaging does it come in?

The cologne is available in two primary bottle sizes: a 100ml travel bottle and a larger 200ml bottle. Both feature sleek black glass bottles with signature gold accents, matching the brand's premium aesthetic. 

The packaging design incorporates subtle Harry Styles branding elements, including the artist's name and logo embossed on the bottle. 


### How should you store the fragrance?

Store Harry Styles cologne in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat sources. Exposure to extreme temperatures can degrade the fragrance quality and accelerate alcohol evaporation. 

Avoid storing the bottle near strong chemicals or perfumes, as these can affect the composition of the fragrance or damage the packaging material.
