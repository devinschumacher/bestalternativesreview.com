## Buyer's Guide

A reliable robotic pool cleaner is a practical investment that can significantly reduce pool maintenance time and effort. The Dolphin Premier model offers several key features designed to enhance cleaning performance and simplify maintenance.

Look for a cleaner with sufficient suction power to effectively remove debris from your pool's corners and floors. The Dolphin Premier delivers consistent cleaning performance thanks to its robust motor and efficient filtration system. 


### Navigation and Pathology

Robotic pool cleaners use various navigation methods, including grid mapping and obstacle avoidance. The Dolphin Premier employs advanced pathfinding algorithms to create optimal cleaning patterns and ensure thorough coverage of your pool area. 


### Compatibility and Installation

Most robotic pool cleaners require some basic installation, such as positioning the charging station and ensuring proper water flow. The Dolphin Premier designs are generally straightforward to install and maintain, though specific requirements may vary by model. 


### Maintenance and Filter System

Regular maintenance, including filter cleaning and inspection, is essential for optimal performance. The Dolphin Premier features a user-friendly filter system that makes maintenance relatively simple and straightforward. 


## FAQ


### What sets the Dolphin Premier Robotic Pool Cleaner apart from other cleaners?

The Dolphin Premier combines advanced filtration capabilities with user-friendly controls. Unlike basic models, it features Smart Navigation technology that maps and cleans your pool efficiently, even in complex shapes. 

It outperforms competitors with its powerful 450-watt motor that lifts debris easily, from sand to tennis balls. The smart dock system automatically returns the cleaner to its base when the battery is low or the cleaning cycle completes. 


### How does the Smart Navigation system work?

The Dolphin Premier uses multiple sensors to detect pool edges, corners, and obstacles. It creates a detailed map of your pool and determines the most efficient cleaning path. 

The system can adjust its cleaning pattern based on pool conditions. For example, it will increase speed in areas with more debris and slow down in calm spots. 


### What maintenance is required for the Dolphin Premier?

The primary maintenance is simple: empty the debris container after each cleaning cycle. Regularly check the brushes and remove any tangles or debris wrapped around them. 

The filter and pump should be cleaned monthly, and the batteries serviced every six months. The robot itself needs an annual deep cleaning and inspection by a professional. 


### Can the Dolphin Premier handle large debris like leaves and branches?

The standard debris container is designed for regular debris like leaves and small particles. For larger items like branches, the pool should be cleared manually before running the cleaner. 

The motor can handle moderate debris, but using the vacuum attachment can help catch larger pieces that might clog the standard filter. 


### What are the power settings options?

The Dolphin Premier offers three power settings: standard, heavy debris, and extended clean cycle. The standard setting is suitable for normal pool maintenance. 

Heavy debris mode increases suction power and run time, ideal when you notice more debris in the pool. The extended clean cycle option runs for longer without returning to the dock. 


### How long does the battery last?

The battery provides up to five hours of runtime on a single charge, sufficient for cleaning most residential pools. The runtime depends on the cleaning mode and pool size. 

The robot automatically returns to the dock when the battery reaches 20% to begin charging. A full recharge takes about three hours, allowing for back-to-back cleaning sessions.
