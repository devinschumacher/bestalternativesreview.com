Select glasses with 100% UV protection to shield your eyes from harmful rays. Some models feature built-in sunglass lenses that darken automatically in sunlight or can be swapped out for different lens colors. 


### Size and Fit

Proper fit is crucial for comfort and protection. The glasses should sit flat on your nose with no slipping, and the temples should hug behind your ears without pressure. Consider models with adjustable nosepieces and temple arms for a customized fit.

The design minimizes peripheral blind spots that can occur with shorter shields, making these glasses particularly suitable for environments where side impacts are possible. 


### What maintenance requirements are there?
