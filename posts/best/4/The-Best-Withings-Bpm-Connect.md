## FAQ


### What is the Withings BPM Connect?

The Withings BPM Connect is a medical-grade blood pressure monitor that tracks your blood pressure throughout the day and syncs with your smartphone using Bluetooth technology. It provides accurate readings on your Withings app, helping you monitor your health and track changes over time. 

Key features include 24/7 heart rate monitoring, silent hypertension notifications, and compatibility with both iOS and Android devices. The device stores up to 1,200 measurements and can send data directly to your healthcare provider if you choose to share it. 


### How accurate is the BPM Connect compared to clinical devices?

The BPM Connect meets the highest standards for blood pressure monitoring devices, as certified by the European Union's CE marking. It has been clinically validated to be accurate within 2 to 4 mmHg of a mercury sphygmomanometer, which is considered the gold standard for blood pressure measurement devices. 

While no device is perfect, the BPM Connect's readings consistently fall within the recommended ±4 mmHg range compared to medical devices. This level of accuracy makes it a reliable choice for at-home blood pressure monitoring. 


### Can the BPM Connect detect silent hypertension?

The BPM Connect features a built-in algorithm that analyzes your blood pressure readings to identify patterns associated with silent hypertension, a condition where high blood pressure causes no symptoms. When the device detects potential hypertension, it sends a silent notification to your phone. 

This early warning system helps users recognize the need for medical attention before experiencing symptoms. The device tracks your blood pressure trends over time, flagging any significant changes in your readings. 


### How often should I monitor my blood pressure with the BPM Connect?

The BPM Connect allows you to customize your monitoring schedule based on your healthcare provider's recommendations. Common monitoring frequencies include daily checks in the morning and evening, or more frequent monitoring during periods of illness or stress. 

For most users, daily monitoring is recommended to establish baseline readings and track changes over time. Your healthcare provider may recommend more frequent monitoring based on your specific medical history and condition. 


### What data storage options are available with the BPM Connect?

The BPM Connect stores up to 1,200 blood pressure measurements and associated heart rate data on its internal memory. This storage capacity allows you to keep a complete record of your readings for at least a year, depending on how frequently you use the device. 

The device also syncs with the Withings app, where you can view your historical data and generate reports. All stored data can be exported to PDF format for easy sharing with your healthcare provider if needed. 


### Is the BPM Connect suitable for all age groups?

The BPM Connect is approved for use by adults over 18 years old. While it can be used by older adults and individuals with chronic conditions, it's important to follow proper usage guidelines and consult with a healthcare provider before beginning regular monitoring. 

Children under 18 years old should not use the BPM Connect, as it is not specifically designed for pediatric use. For children with high blood pressure, specialized equipment and guidance from a healthcare provider are recommended.
