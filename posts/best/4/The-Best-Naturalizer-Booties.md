### What materials are used in Naturalizer booties?

These booties are typically crafted from high-quality leather, with some featuring suede or fabric upper materials for variety. The leather is often full-grain, providing durability and a premium feel. 

Most booties incorporate leather linings and insoles for long-term comfort, with select styles offering additional cushioning options. 


### How should I care for my Naturalizer booties?

Regular maintenance keeps your booties looking their best. Use a soft cloth to wipe away dirt and dust, and consider applying a leather conditioner to keep the material supple.
