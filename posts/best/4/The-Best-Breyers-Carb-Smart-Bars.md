## FAQ


### What are Breyers Carb Smart Bars?

Breyers Carb Smart Bars are a diabetes-friendly dessert option that features fewer carbohydrates per serving compared to traditional ice cream bars. These bars combine creamy ice cream with a variety of topping options like caramel, chocolate, and cookies. 

Each bar typically contains around 20-25 grams of carbohydrates, making them suitable for those monitoring their carbohydrate intake. The ice cream portion is reduced in fat compared to regular ice cream bars to achieve this carbohydrate count. 


### How do they differ from regular Breyers bars?

Carb Smart Bars feature a lower carbohydrate content through a combination of smaller ice cream portions and reduced-calorie sweeteners in the toppings. Regular Breyers ice cream bars contain more ice cream and higher sugar content, making them less suitable for carbohydrate-counting diets. 

The carbohydrates in Carb Smart Bars come from a mixture of sugars and artificial sweeteners, while regular bars contain primarily sugar from the ice cream and toppings. 


### What nutrition benefits do they offer?

These bars provide a balance of carbohydrates and some beneficial nutrients. They contain calcium from the milk in the ice cream and vitamin D in the coatings. The reduced-fat content makes them a lower-calorie dessert option compared to regular ice cream bars. 

Despite these benefits, they should be consumed in moderation as part of a balanced diet, due to their carbohydrate content and added sugars. 


### What are the serving options?

Breyers offers several flavor combinations in their Carb Smart Bar lineup, including classic chocolate, vanilla with caramel, and cookies and cream. Each serving includes a small scoop of ice cream topped with a sugar-free coating. 

Sugar-free coat varieties are also available, featuring coating flavors like mocha swirl and peanut butter cups without added sugar. 


### Who are these bars suitable for?

Carb Smart Bars are particularly beneficial for people with diabetes or individuals monitoring their carbohydrate intake. They provide a convenient dessert option that allows for occasional indulgence while staying within dietary guidelines. 

These bars may also appeal to anyone seeking lower-calorie dessert options or those transitioning from regular ice cream bars to more controlled carbohydrate alternatives. 


### How are they stored and consumed?

Carb Smart Bars should be stored in a freezer to maintain their frozen texture. They typically need to be thawed for a brief period before consumption to achieve optimal melting properties, allowing the coating to properly adhere to the ice cream scoop. 

Each bar serves one person and is best consumed shortly after removal from the freezer to enjoy the intended texture and flavor combination.
