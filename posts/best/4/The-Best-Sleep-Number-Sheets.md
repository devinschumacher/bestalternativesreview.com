## Buyer's Guide

Sleep Number sheets combine comfort with advanced technology, offering a personalized sleep solution through customizable firmness levels. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you choose the right sheets for your Sleep Number bed. 


### Fabric and Material Technology

Sleep Number sheets are available in various fabric options, including premium cotton, performance fabric, and premium performance fabric. The material technology affects breathability, moisture management, and temperature regulation, so consider your sleep environment and personal comfort preferences. 


### Custom Firmness Technology

Like the mattress, Sleep Number sheets use Custom Firmness Technology to adjust to your body shape and pressure points. Look for sheets that match your preferred level of firmness for optimal comfort during the night. 


### Durability and Long-term Quality

Sleep Number sheets are known for their durability, but the quality can vary between fabric types. Premium performance fabrics often offer the longest-lasting options, while budget-friendly alternatives may require more frequent replacement. 


### Size Compatibility and Customization

The sheets come in standard King, Queen, and Twin sizes, with the option to add a sleep number to the corners for extra comfort. Consider whether you want standard or customized corner sleep numbers when selecting your sheets. 


## FAQ


### What materials are the Sleep Number sheets made from?

Sleep Number sheets are crafted from a proprietary blend of microfiber that combines moisture-wicking, breathable properties with a luxurious softness. The material is designed to stay cool during the night while wicking away moisture, keeping you comfortable throughout the sleep cycle. 

The sheets come in two primary compositions: a 100% Egyptian cotton version for those who prefer natural fibers, and a microfiber blend for optimal comfort and durability. Both versions are hypoallergenic and feature StayClean protection to minimize allergens and bacteria. 


### How do I wash Sleep Number sheets?

To maintain the quality and longevity of Sleep Number sheets, it's recommended to wash them separately in the first cycle using the gentle cycle of your washing machine. For subsequent washes, you can use either the gentle or regular cycle. Always use a mild detergent and avoid fabric softeners, as they can reduce the sheets' moisture-wicking properties. 

Air drying is preferred for optimal sheet quality, but if using a dryer, select a low heat setting. The sheets should not be tumble dried, as this can cause shrinkage and damage the fabrics. 


### Are Sleep Number sheets machine washable?

Yes, Sleep Number sheets are machine washable, but there are specific care instructions to follow for the best results. It's crucial to wash them in a separate cycle the first time to prevent color transfer, and to use a mild detergent compatible with microfiber materials. 

While the sheets are designed for regular machine washing, hand washing is recommended for the first wash to ensure proper care and maintain their quality. Each subsequent wash can be done in the machine, following the recommended care instructions. 


### How long do Sleep Number sheets last?

With proper care, Sleep Number sheets typically last 2-3 years under normal use. Factors that affect their longevity include frequency of washing, drying conditions, and whether they're used as top or bottom sheets. 

Top sheets, which come into direct contact with the sleeper, may need replacement more frequently than bottom sheets due to increased exposure to body oils and perspiration. Regular maintenance, including proper washing and storage, can extend their lifespan. 


### What sizes are available for Sleep Number sheets?

Sleep Number sheets are available in a range of standard mattress sizes including Twin, TwinXL, Full, Queen, King, and California King. Each size is carefully designed to fit standard mattress depths and cover the entire surface evenly. 

Specialty sizes, such as split queen or queen trundle, are also available for specific mattress configurations. The sheets are machine washable and made from premium materials that maintain their shape and fit even after multiple washes. 


### Can Sleep Number sheets be customized?

Sleep Number sheets can be customized to your specific needs through their online configuration tool, allowing you to select the ideal sheet set for your mattress size and preferred firmness level. You can choose between two types of sheets: Top Sheets and Bottom Sheets, each with different properties and benefits. 

You can also select your preferred material type (100% Egyptian cotton or microfiber blend) and firmness level (Standard, Firm, or Extra Firm) to match your sleep preferences and mattress needs.
