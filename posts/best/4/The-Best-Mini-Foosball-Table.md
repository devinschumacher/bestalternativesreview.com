## FAQ


### What is a mini foosball table?

A mini foosball table is a scaled-down version of the traditional foosball game table, typically measuring around 24-36 inches (60-91 cm) in length. These smaller tables are designed for compact spaces and accommodate fewer players, making them ideal for home gaming rooms, apartments, or playrooms. 

Mini foosball tables maintain the essential features of full-size tables, including rotating players and goal posts, while optimizing space efficiency and player control. 


### What are the key differences between mini and standard foosball tables?

Mini foosball tables are shorter and narrower than standard tables, measuring approximately 60-91 cm in length compared to the typical 120-150 cm of full-size tables. They usually accommodate 2-3 players, while standard tables support 4-6 players. 

The playing surface of mini tables is smaller, typically 24-36 inches long, with narrower gaps between players. The overall weight and durability can also vary, as mini tables are designed for indoor use in residential settings. 


### What age range is suitable for mini foosball tables?

Mini foosball tables are generally suitable for children aged 6 and up, with features like smaller gaps between players that make them less likely to cause injury. The reduced size also makes them easier for children to maneuver and control. 

Younger children may need supervision when using mini foosball tables, while older children and adults can enjoy competitive matches with friends or family members. 


### What maintenance requirements do mini foosball tables have?

Mini foosball tables should be cleaned regularly with mild soap and water to maintain hygiene and remove any dust or debris. The rotating players and mechanisms should be lubricated with specialized foosball table oil every 3-6 months to prevent wear and ensure smooth operation. 

The table surface should be inspected monthly for any loose screws or damaged components. It's also important to store the table with the surface facing down when not in use to protect the mechanism. 


### What are the weight capacity options for mini foosball tables?

Mini foosball tables typically have a weight capacity of 50-100 pounds, with most models supporting up to 100 pounds safely. This capacity is sufficient for casual play and occasional tournament matches. 

Professional-grade mini foosball tables may have higher weight capacities (150-200 pounds) to accommodate more frequent use or competitive play. Always check the specific weight capacity of the table you're considering to ensure it meets your needs. 


### What games can be played on a mini foosball table?

Mini foosball tables are primarily designed for playing foosball, a tabletop miniature form of soccer. This classic game requires players to rotate the miniature soccer players while attempting to score goals through the opposing team's goal post. 

While foosball is the primary game, some mini tables may offer additional features like shooting games or mini bumper cars. However, these variations are less common and may affect the integrity of the foosball playing surface.
