## FAQ


### What makes Wild Earth dog food unique?

Wild Earth's dog food stands out through its use of novel protein sources like insects and exotic meats, combined with advanced nutritional science to exceed AAFCO standards. Unlike traditional dog foods, their recipes incorporate freeze-dried organs and superfoods to provide complete nutrition while promoting natural health benefits. 

Each meal contains essential omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and probiotics to support immune health, skin & coat quality, and digestive well-being. Their innovative approach sets them apart in the crowded dog food market, offering pet owners a scientifically-backed alternative to conventional pet nutrition. 


### Is Wild Earth dog food suitable for all breeds and life stages?

While Wild Earth's food can be beneficial for many dogs, it's essential to consider your pet's specific needs. Small breeds, senior dogs, or those with health conditions might require specialized formulations. Always consult with your veterinarian before switching your pet's diet, especially if they have unique nutritional requirements. 

Wild Earth offers several formulas tailored to different life stages and breeds. Their primary diet is suitable for adult dogs, while specialized formulas are available for small breeds, senior dogs, and pets with specific health needs. Regular veterinary check-ups help ensure you choose the right nutrition for your pet's individual health profile. 


### How does Wild Earth ensure food safety?

Wild Earth employs rigorous quality control measures to prevent contamination. Their facilities undergo regular audits by independent third-party organizations, and they test every batch for pathogens and contaminants. However, like any pet food company, they face challenges with ingredient sourcing and manufacturing standards. 

While their safety protocols are robust, incidents of pet illness associated with frozen dog foods have occurred. This highlights the need for cautious introduction and monitoring when switching diets. Always follow recommended feeding instructions and watch for signs of digestive intolerance or allergic reactions. 


### What is the shelf life of Wild Earth dog food?

Wild Earth's meals have a typical shelf life of 90 days from production. Their packaging includes a freshness window that indicates remaining days, and the food maintains quality for at least 48 hours after opening. Proper storage in the refrigerator extends freshness but doesn't significantly extend the shelf life. 

After opening, always consume the food within 48 hours for optimal safety and quality. Discard any food that shows signs of spoilage, such as off odors, changes in texture, or mold. Proper refrigeration and prompt consumption help maintain the nutritional integrity of the food. 


### How do I transition my dog to Wild Earth food?

A gradual transition of 7-10 days helps your dog adjust to the new food without digestive upset. Start by mixing small amounts of Wild Earth with your pet's current food, gradually increasing the proportion daily until fully switched. Pay attention to your dog's reaction during this period, as some may need longer adjustment times. 

If your dog has specific dietary requirements or health conditions, consider working with a veterinary nutritionist during the transition. This ensures you address any potential nutritional gaps while supporting your pet's digestive health. 


### What are the key ingredients in Wild Earth dog food?

Wild Earth's recipes feature innovative ingredients like grasshoppers, kangaroo meat, and freeze-dried liver. Their primary ingredients include novel proteins, superfoods, and essential vitamins, providing complete nutrition without artificial additives. Each meal contains carefully selected components to support overall health and well-being. 

While their formulas use unique ingredients, Wild Earth adheres to AAFCO nutritional guidelines. This means their food provides complete nutrition, though the specific nutrient profile may differ from traditional dog food formulations. Always check the ingredient list to ensure it meets your pet's dietary needs.
