## Buyer's Guide

Choosing the right above ground pool skimmer is crucial for maintaining water clarity and efficiency. Skimmers remove floating debris and keep the water surface clean, preventing larger items from entering the pool's filtration system. 


### Filter Capacity

Select a skimmer with a filter basket that matches your pool's surface area. A general rule is to have a filter capacity of 1/20th of your pool's surface area. This ensures adequate filtration without overloading the system. 


### Construction Materials

Look for skimmers made from durable, corrosion-resistant materials like stainless steel or plastic composites. The frame should be strong enough to support the weight of the water and any debris. Check if the screen mesh is secure and easy to maintain. 


### Installation and Placement

Properly positioning the skimmer is essential for optimal performance. Install it at least 6 inches above the pool water level to prevent flooding but low enough to capture surface debris. Ensure it's level to maintain consistent water flow. 


### Maintenance Requirements

Regular maintenance is key to a skimmer's effectiveness. The filter basket should be cleaned weekly during peak swimming seasons. Check for leaks, loose connections, and ensure all components are working properly before each swimming season. 


## FAQ


### What is an above ground pool skimmer?

Essentially, an above ground pool skimmer is a specialized pool cleaning tool designed to remove floating debris from the water's surface. Mounted on the pool wall, it works in conjunction with the pool pump to create suction and draw trash into a collection basket for easy removal. 

These skimmers feature a telescoping arm that extends into the pool's water, allowing the basket to be cleaned or emptied without needing to access the pool itself. This makes debris removal efficient and convenient, improving water clarity and maintaining pool hygiene. 


### How does an above ground pool skimmer work?

When the pool pump is turned on, it creates suction through the skimmer's inlet. This powerful suction draws floating debris and small particles into the skimmer's basket, where they are collected and held until the basket is emptied. 

The telescoping arm extends the collection basket directly into the water, ensuring optimal debris collection while maintaining a clean and organized appearance around the pool's edge. 


### What materials are above ground pool skimmers made from?

Most skimmers are constructed from durable plastic, which resists corrosion and UV damage from direct sunlight. High-quality skimmers feature reinforced frames and UV-resistant materials to ensure longevity in outdoor environments. 

Some premium models incorporate stainless steel components for the telescoping arm and frame, offering superior durability and resistance to rust and corrosion. 


### How do I install an above ground pool skimmer?

The installation process typically requires attachment to the pool coping (the edge of the pool) using specialized clips or mounting brackets. The skimmer box is secured in place, and the telescoping arm is connected to the pump inlet. 

Proper alignment and level installation are crucial to prevent leaks and ensure efficient operation. Manufacturers provide detailed instructions and sometimes professional installation services for added peace of mind. 


### What maintenance is required for above ground pool skimmers?

Regular maintenance includes checking and cleaning the telescoping arm, ensuring it extends and retracts smoothly. The collection basket should be emptied weekly or as needed to prevent overflow and maintain suction efficiency. 

Inspect the skimmer's seal and gasket for wear or damage, and check for any signs of leaks. Proper maintenance extends the skimmer's lifespan and ensures consistent performance. 


### How do I clean an above ground pool skimmer?

Clean the telescoping arm and collection basket monthly or as needed with soap and water. For stubborn debris, use a stiff brush to remove dirt and grime. Ensure all parts are completely dry before reassembly. 

Check the skimmer's exterior monthly for signs of damage or wear. If using a plastic skimmer, check for cracks or softened material that may indicate UV damage or material degradation.
