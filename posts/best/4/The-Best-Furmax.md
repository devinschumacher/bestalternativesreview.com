### What's the difference between these breeds?

While all these breeds share similar furless characteristics, they vary in size, temperament, and specific needs. Some, like the Chinese Crested, have unique traits such as hairless body and feathery limbs. 

Others, like the Bichon Frise, have a distinctive frizzy coat that requires regular grooming. Each breed profile details their specific requirements, helping you choose the right match for your lifestyle.
