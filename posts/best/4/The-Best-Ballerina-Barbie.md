## Buyer's Guide

When selecting a Ballerina Barbie, consider her overall design, pose, and costume details to find the perfect dancer to join your collection. The most authentic versions feature detailed pointe shoes, tutu skirts, and elegant ballet poses. Look for articulation in her joints to see if she can move gracefully like a real ballerina. 


### Design Authenticity

Original Ballerina Barbies from the 1960s have a distinctive look with their pointed toes, flowing skirts, and elegant poise. Modern versions often include updated costumes and accessories, but maintaining the classic ballerina silhouette remains important. Check for details like elasticated tutus and genuine pointe shoes that match her pose. 


### Articulation and Poses

A ballerina's pose should demonstrate grace and control. Look for dolls with flexible joints that allow for various ballet positions. The most realistic poses show weight distribution through one foot while the other leg gracefully extends in a second position. Avoid dolls with stiff limbs that cannot maintain a natural dancing stance. 


### Package and Accessories

The packaging often reveals valuable information about a Barbie's rarity and condition. Premium versions come in sealed boxes with protective foam interiors. Additional accessories like dance ribbons, music stands, or mirror bases can enhance play value and showcase the doll's costume details. Consider the accessories that come with the basic doll as well as any additional items included.
