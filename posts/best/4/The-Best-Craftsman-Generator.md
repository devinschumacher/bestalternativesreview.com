## Buyer's Guide

Craftsman generators are a popular choice for homeowners and businesses, offering reliable backup power during outages. When selecting a craftsman generator, several key factors influence performance and longevity. 


### Output Power

Consider the generator's wattage rating, distinguishing between running and starting watts. Running watts support continuous operation, while starting watts account for the initial surge needed to power appliances. For residential use, calculate total connected load, accounting for simultaneous operation of major appliances. 


### Size and Portability

Evaluate the generator's weight and dimensions based on installation location and mobility needs. Whole-house generators require dedicated installation, while portable models offer flexibility for recreational or emergency use. Commercial applications may benefit from industrial-grade portable units. 


### Fuel Efficiency and Environmental Impact

Compare fuel consumption rates and emission standards. Generator efficiency affects operating costs and environmental impact. Alternative fuels like propane or natural gas often offer improved efficiency and reduced maintenance requirements compared to standard gasoline. 


### Installation and Maintenance Requirements

Assess the complexity of installation, including necessary electrical and plumbing connections. Regular maintenance schedules impact longevity and operational costs. Consider features like automatic transfer switches and built-in maintenance reminders for ease of use. 


## FAQ


### What is a Craftsman generator?

Craftsman generators are portable power solutions that allow you to run essential household appliances during power outages. These generators typically run on gasoline and can provide either standard household voltage (120 volts) or a combination of 120 and 240 volts. 

They come with features like automatic transfer switches and multiple outlets, making them convenient alternatives to whole-house generators. The most common models include the 4000 series entry-level generators and the higher-capacity 8000 series models. 


### How much noise does a Craftsman generator make?

Standard Craftsman generators are relatively quiet for their size, producing around 62-66 decibels at full load. For perspective, this is about as loud as a normal conversation. 

If you need a quieter option, consider the Craftsman Quiet-Comfort 4000 series, which uses a specialized muffler and engine technology to reduce noise to 55 decibels at full load, comparable to a refrigerator. 


### What maintenance do Craftsman generators require?

Basic maintenance includes checking the oil level before each use, replacing the air filter every 25 hours or six months, and changing the oil after the first 25 hours and then every 50 hours of use. 

For longer-term storage, the oil should be changed completely within the first 30 days, and the generator should be run at least once a month for 30 minutes to prevent corrosion and maintain battery health. 


### Can Craftsman generators run during cold weather?

Most Craftsman generators can operate down to 0Â°F (-18Â°C), featuring a muffler-heated air intake system to prevent condensation and protect the engine from cold-start problems. 

For optimal performance in cold weather, use a quality fuel stabilize (such as Sta-Bil) and run the generator for at least 30 minutes once every 30 days during the winter. 


### What size generator do I need?

To determine your generator size needs, first list all the appliances you want to power. Add up their wattage requirements and look for a generator that provides at least 125% of that total (for example, a 3000-watt generator can power devices totaling 3750 watts). 

Consider the starting wattage requirements, as some appliances (like refrigerators) require more power to start than they use while running. Always choose a generator based on the appliances you plan to use simultaneously. 


### How long do Craftsman generators last?

With proper maintenance, a Craftsman generator can last between 10 to 15 years. Most parts, including the engine, have a warranty of 2-3 years, while the generator as a whole typically covers 5 years. 

Regular maintenance, running the generator for at least 30 minutes monthly, and changing the oil after the first 25 hours of use can significantly extend its lifespan. Always refer to the specific model's maintenance schedule for the best guidance.
