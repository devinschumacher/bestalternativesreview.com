Corelle's proprietary Tri-Fire™ technology combines three layers of material for strength and durability, making these mugs resistant to chipping and cracking under normal use. 


### Mug Diameter and Handle Design

Mug diameters range from the compact 3.5-ounce travel cups to generous 16-ounce mugs. Handle designs vary from straight to wrapped styles, each affecting grip comfort and ergonomics. Consider whether you prefer easy-to-hold straight handles or the extra grip provided by wrapped handles. 


### Crock and Base Construction

The interior crock is where your liquid comes in contact with the mug. Corelle offers ceramic-coated and glass-like options that range from matte to glossy finishes. The base design affects stability and should match your storage and counter space. Some bases are smooth, while others have a textured surface to prevent sliding. 


### Color and Design Options

Some patterns are more durable and fade-resistant than others, so select based on your lifestyle and usage needs.
