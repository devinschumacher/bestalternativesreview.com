## Buyer's Guide

Acoustic guitar pickups capture the instrument's sound for amplification or recording. Understanding the different types, their installation requirements, and the impact on tone is crucial for selecting the right pickup. 


### Types of Acoustic Guitar Pickups

There are three primary types: piezo, magnetic, and electromagnetic. Piezo pickups, the most common, convert string vibration into an electrical signal through crystal elements under each string. Magnetic pickups work similarly to electric guitar pickups, inducing a magnetic field that captures string movement. Electromagnetic pickups use coils wound around magnetic rods to generate the signal. 


### Installation Considerations

Installation affects both performance and the instrument's integrity. Under-saddle pickups require precise mounting to maintain bridge height and proper string contact. Surface-mounted pickups may need additional bracing to prevent bodywarping. Consider the pickup's size and shape, as some models offer more visual integration than others. 


### Tone and Response Characteristics

Piezo pickups excel in capturing the full spectrum of acoustic sound but can be more susceptible to feedback. Magnetic pickups deliver a brighter, more focused tone but may not capture the same nuance as piezo. Electromagnetic pickups offer a versatile tone but require careful setup to prevent hum and interference. Consider your playing style and the sound you want to achieve when choosing pickup characteristics. 


### Power Consumption and Setup Requirements

Piezo and magnetic pickups typically have built-in preamplifiers, handling power consumption internally. Electromagnetic pickups often require external power sources, affecting both setup complexity and cost. Consider the amplifier's ability to provide phantom power for electromagnetic systems and the convenience of internal processing for piezo and magnetic setups. 


## FAQ


### What is an acoustic guitar pickup?

An acoustic guitar pickup is a device that captures the sound of an acoustically amplified guitar and converts it into an electrical signal. This allows the guitar's sound to be amplified through speakers or recorded electronically. 

Most acoustic guitar pickups fall into two categories: under-saddle transducers and piezoelectric pickups. Under-saddle transducers mount beneath the bridge saddle and use vibrations to generate sound. Piezoelectric pickups convert mechanical vibrations into electrical signals using small crystals. 


### How does an acoustic guitar pickup affect the sound?

Acoustic guitar pickups can significantly alter the instrument's tone. Under-saddle transducers tend to preserve the guitar's natural sound more closely, while piezoelectric pickups can add brightness and clarity. 

Most pickups feature adjustable tone controls to help match the preamp's character. This allows players to tailor the pickup's contribution to their overall sound while maintaining the instrument's integrity. 


### What considerations should I make when choosing an acoustic guitar pickup?

Key factors include the guitar's body type, preferred tone character (bright vs. warm), and budget. Body type affects the pickup's mounting options and performance, while tone character determines the technical features needed. 

Installation capability is crucial, as some pickups require significant modifications. Quality builds and proper mounting techniques ensure optimal performance and longevity. 


### How do I install an acoustic guitar pickup?

Professional installation is recommended for most pickup types, especially under-saddle transducers. Basic steps include securing the pickup, wiring connection, and mounting it properly to the guitar's bridge plate. 

Proper grounding and insulation prevent hum and interference. Professional installation ensures correct placement and secure connections, preserving the guitar's integrity. 


### Can I use an acoustic guitar pickup with any preamp?

Most modern preamps are compatible with standard pickup outputs. However, certain pickup designs may require specific preamp features or configurations. 

Always verify compatibility between your pickup and preamp. Some pickups need active versus passive preamp settings, while others require specific mounting configurations. 


### How do I maintain an acoustic guitar pickup?

Regular cleaning with soft cloths prevents dust accumulation. For under-saddle transducers, check the mounting clip periodically for loosening. 

Professional servicing every 2-3 years ensures optimal performance and reliable connections. This maintenance includes checking wire integrity and cleaning internal components.
