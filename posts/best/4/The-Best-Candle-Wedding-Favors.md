## Buyer's Guide

Candle wedding favors create a warm, personal touch for your guests, combining practicality with romance. When selecting candles, consider the following factors to ensure your chosen favors enhance both your celebration and your guests' departure gifts. 


### Scent Selection

The fragrance should complement your venue and personal style. Floral scents like lavender or rose work well for romantic weddings, while citrus notes add a fresh, invigorating touch. Consider your guests' preferences and any potential allergies when choosing scents. 


### Size and Style

Common sizes include small votives (2-3 inches), taper candles (5-8 inches), and pillar candles (3-20 inches). The style should match your wedding decor - simple glass jars work with any theme, while specialty molds offer unique, memorable favors suitable for themed weddings. 


### Light Considerations

Ensure the candle's burn time aligns with your needs - short-burning options for intimate gatherings versus longer-burning candles for extended celebrations. The wick type affects both burn quality and scent dispersion, so choose between metal-core wicks for larger candles and cotton wicks for smaller ones. 


### Customization Options

Add personal touches through customization options like engraved names, personalized messages, or themed packaging. Consider how the packaging will be distributed - sealed containers protect candles during transport, while decorative boxes offer elegant presentation for immediate use. 


## FAQ


### What materials are typically used in candle wedding favors?

The most common materials used in candle wedding favors include paraffin wax, which is easy to shape and clean-burning, and cotton wicks. Many favors also incorporate decorative elements like glass jars, ceramic containers, or decorative wraps made from materials such as kraft paper or burlap. 

Some specialty candles may use soy wax or beeswax for their natural properties, though these materials can be more expensive and require different handling methods. 


### How long do typical candle wedding favors burn?

Paraffin wax candles usually burn for 2-3 hours per inch of diameter, making a 2-inch candle burn for approximately 4-6 hours. Soy or beeswax candles typically burn 30-50% longer than paraffin candles of the same size. 

Exact burn time can vary based on candle quality, container material, and environmental factors like altitude and ambient temperature. 


### What types of candles are ideal for outdoor wedding favors?

Outdoor-friendly candles are typically made from water-resistant materials like metal containers or waterproof wicks. Popular options include pillar candles with metal bases, glass containers with outdoor-safe labels, or votive candles housed in weatherproof holders. 

Some couples opt for battery-powered LED candles, which provide the visual appeal of a traditional candle without the fire hazard. 


### How can I incorporate personalization into candle wedding favors?

Candle favors can be personalized through custom-printed labels, monogrammed packaging, or unique scent choices. Many manufacturers offer custom printing services on candle containers or packaging materials. 

Some couples choose to include handwritten notes or personal photos inside favor boxes, adding a heartfelt touch that goes beyond the candle itself. 


### What safety considerations should I keep in mind when choosing candle wedding favors?

Ensure all candles come with proper safety instructions, including burn time recommendations and warning labels. Opt for containers and materials that prevent tipping or accidental fire hazards. 

Consider the placement of favors â€“ candles should not be placed near curtains, paper decorations, or other flammable materials. Always provide clear instructions for safe usage. 


### How should I store and maintain candle wedding favors?

Store candles in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and extreme temperature changes. Avoid storing candles near heat sources like radiators or heaters. 

Before burning, remove any wrapping materials that could affect the wick's performance. Keep burning candles away from drafts and flammable materials, and never leave burning candles unattended.
