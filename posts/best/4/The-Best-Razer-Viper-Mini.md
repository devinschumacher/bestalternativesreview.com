### What is the Razer Viper Mini?

The Razer Viper Mini is a gaming mouse designed for competitive gaming, featuring a 20,000 CPI sensor and customizable RGB lighting. It's known for its precision and performance, with features like 10 programmable buttons and wireless connectivity via Razer's own 2.4GHz HyperSpeed technology. 

Unlike the full-sized Viper, it's constructed for portability with fewer buttons, making it ideal for gamers who need a small, powerful mouse for tournaments or travel. 


### How does the Razer Viper Mini compare to other Razer mice?

While the Razer Viper delivers premium performance with its 16,000 CPI sensor, the mini version offers similar tracking accuracy while being more compact. It trades some of the advanced features like Razer Focus+ sensor and seven programmable buttons for a lighter, more portable design. 

For comparison, the DeathAdder V2 has a more premium build quality and additional features like palm rest, but the Viper Mini focuses on essential gaming elements for competitive play.

![Razer-Viper-Mini-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Razer-Viper-Mini-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the key differences between the Razer Viper Mini and the standard Viper?

The major difference is size and button count - the mini version measures 64% smaller with 27% fewer buttons, making it more portable. While both mice use Razer's 20,000 CPI sensor, the standard Viper adds features like Razer Focus+ sensor technology and a higher polling rate. 

The mini mouse uses 6.2g switches compared to the standard Viper's 7.4g switches, resulting in slightly lighter button presses. Both mice share the same battery life and connectivity options, with the mini maintaining the same performance standards in a more compact form factor. 


### How long does the Razer Viper Mini's battery last, and how is it charged?

The mouse's 1500mAh battery provides up to 72 hours of wireless gaming between charges when HyperPolling Mode is disabled. Battery life can be extended to 90 hours with the feature enabled, which reduces CPU load but affects polling rate. 

Charging is performed through Razer's proprietary USB-C cable. The mouse charges while connected to your computer, with full battery recharge taking about 2.5 hours. For quick gaming sessions, a 15-minute charge provides 16 hours of usage, making it ideal for tournament preparation.
