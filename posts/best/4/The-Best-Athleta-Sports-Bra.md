## Buyer's Guide

Athleta sports bras offer a blend of performance fabrics and modern designs to support your active lifestyle. Understanding key features will help you choose the right bra for your body and exercise routine. 


### Understanding Bra Technology

Athleta bras incorporate moisture-wicking fabrics to keep you dry during workouts. Many models feature compression designs that provide firm support, while others offer more breathable mesh panels for ventilation. The bra's underwire, if present, should comfortably hug your ribcage without digging in. 


### Size and Fit Considerations

Proper sizing is crucial. Start by measuring your band size around your ribcage, just under your breasts. Next, measure the fullest part of your bust to determine your cups. Consider going up a size if you experience compression or pain during exercise. 


### Support Levels

Bra cups range from minimal to high impact. If you have dense breasts or need extra support for larger sizes, look for bras with reinforced underwire and padded cups. For lower-impact activities or smaller bust sizes, softer cups may be more comfortable. 


### Care and Maintenance

Regular washing with mild detergent helps maintain the bra's shape and performance. Most athleta sports bras can be machine washed, but check the care label first. Allowing the bra to air dry extends its lifespan and prevents sagging. 


## FAQ


### What makes an Athleta sports bra different from other athletic bras?

Athleta sports bras are designed with performance fabrics and advanced moisture-wicking technology to keep you dry during workouts. Unlike basic athletic bras, Athleta's bras feature targeted compression and strategic foam padding for enhanced support. 

The most significant difference is their moisture management system, which combines breathable fabrics with sweat-wicking technology to prevent that uncomfortable, heavy feeling during intense exercises. 


### How should I measure for an Athleta sports bra?

Measure around your ribcage just below your breasts for your band size, ensuring the tape measures snugly but not tight. Then, measure the fullest part of your bust for your cup size. 

For proper fit, the band should have minimal stretching when worn, while the cups should feel slightly roomy but not saggy. If you prefer a more fitted look, size down in the band measurement. 


### What materials are used in Athleta sports bras?

Athleta uses a blend of moisture-wicking fabrics like polyester and spandex, combined with breathable mesh panels for enhanced ventilation during workouts. 

Padding is typically made from foam with a thin polyester outer layer, providing the right balance of support without bulk. The band features a elasticized edge for secure fit during high-impact activities. 


### How long do Athleta sports bras last?

Most well-maintained Athleta sports bras last 6-12 months with regular wear, depending on your workout intensity and frequency. 

Signs that indicate it's time for a replacement include stretched elastic, worn-out padding, and visible seams. If you've worn the bra through multiple wash cycles, check for any degradation in material quality. 


### What's the best way to wash an Athleta sports bra?

Rinse the bra under cold water before washing to remove any loose debris. Use a gentle detergent and avoid bleach or fabric softeners, which can damage the moisture-wicking properties. 

Hand wash if possible, or use a gentle cycle in a mesh bag to protect the bra during machine washing. Air dry flat or hang to dry, avoiding direct heat sources like dryers or radiators. 


### How do I size down if I'm between sizes?

If you're between band sizes, err on the smaller size for better support and a more secure fit. If you're between cup sizes, choose your usual size unless you prefer a more fitted look. 

For optimal comfort and performance, it's generally recommended to size down if you have a naturally firm bust. Always consider your intended use – lower-impact activities may allow for a smaller size than higher-impact workouts.
