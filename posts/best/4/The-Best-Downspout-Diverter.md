## Buyer's Guide

Installing a downspout diverter is a practical way to manage water runoff around your home's foundation, redirecting water flow to a more suitable drainage point. When selecting a downspout diverter, consider the following key features and installation requirements to find the right solution for your needs. 


### Materials and Construction

Downspout diverters are available in both plastic and metal materials, with metal options often providing longer-lasting performance in outdoor environments. The construction quality should match the expected load from water flow, with reinforced joints and impact-resistant components ideal for areas prone to debris accumulation. 

![Downspout-Diverter-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Downspout-Diverter-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Drainage Capacity

Calculate the anticipated water flow based on your local rainfall patterns and choose a diverter with sufficient capacity. Generally, a 2-inch diverter can handle 1200 gallons per hour, while a 2.5-inch model is suitable for heavier rainfall conditions. Consider the length of your downspout when determining total flow capacity. 


### Installation Requirements

Accurate measurement and careful installation are crucial for proper water flow and longevity. The diverter must be installed at the appropriate height to create necessary water pressure for redirection. Allow for at least 12 inches of clearance between the downspout termination point and the top of the diverter wall to prevent water surging. 

![Downspout-Diverter-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Downspout-Diverter-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Additional Features

Some diverters include built-in screens to prevent clogs from leaves and debris, which can extend maintenance intervals and improve performance. Consider models with adjustable angle features for precise water direction, especially in sloped landscapes where consistent flow control is important. 


## FAQ

![Downspout-Diverter-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Downspout-Diverter-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a downspout diverter?

A downspout diverter is a device installed in the gutter system to redirect water from one downspout to another. This is particularly useful when managing water flow in larger gutters or when two downspouts are needed at different points along the same fascia. 

The typical installation involves connecting the diverter between the downspout and the extension that leads to the ground. When the water flow is sufficient, it pushes a float inside the diverter, causing it to open and redirect water to the secondary downspout. 


### How does a downspout diverter work?

A downspout diverter operates on a float mechanism. As water flows through the main downspout, it rises inside the diverter, causing a float to move upward. When the float reaches a certain height, it triggers a valve mechanism that opens the secondary downspout, allowing water to flow to a different location. 

Most downspout diverters also include a manual override feature. In situations where automatic operation fails or additional control is needed, a simple hand movement can switch the water flow back to the primary downspout. 

![Downspout-Diverter-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Downspout-Diverter-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What materials are downspout diverters made from?

Downspout diverters are available in various materials to suit different installation needs and environmental conditions. Common materials include PVC, copper, and galvanized steel. PVC is popular for its durability and resistance to corrosion, while copper offers excellent longevity but can be more expensive. Galvanized steel provides a robust alternative that resists rusting. 

Some advanced models incorporate stainless steel components to enhance durability, especially in coastal or heavily industrialized environments where exposure to salt and chemicals is a concern. 


### What are the typical applications for downspout diverters?

Downspout diverters are most commonly used in residential gutter systems where water management is critical. They are particularly useful in situations where: - Uneven roof pitches cause water to flow in unpredictable patterns

- Multiple downspouts are necessary for proper water dispersion

- Local zoning laws require specific drainage solutions

The devices are also valuable for commercial applications, such as: - Shopping centers with multiple stores requiring independent drainage

- Industrial facilities needing precise control over runoff patterns

- Large residential developments with complex drainage requirements

![Downspout-Diverter-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Downspout-Diverter-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do you properly install a downspout diverter?

Proper installation of a downspout diverter requires careful consideration of several factors: - Ensure the primary downspout is sufficiently sized to handle the water flow

- Install the diverter between the main downspout and the extension leading to the ground

- Position the secondary downspout outlet at least 6 feet away from the primary outlet to prevent water accumulation

Begin by disconnecting the existing downspout at the gutter connection point. Slide the diverter into place, aligning the float mechanism with the correct orientation. Reconnect the downspout and secure it, then test the system by running water through both outlets to verify proper operation. 


### How should you maintain a downspout diverter?

Regular maintenance of a downspout diverter helps ensure its longevity and reliable operation: - Check the float mechanism annually for proper movement and remove any debris

- Inspect the valve mechanism for signs of wear or damage and replace parts as needed

- Verify that both downspouts remain clear of obstructions and debris

While most diverters require minimal maintenance, checking the system after heavy rainfall or snow melt can help identify potential issues before they become larger problems. For commercial installations, consider performing quarterly inspections to maintain optimal performance.
