### Size and Display Considerations

Select a wreath that matches your space and purpose. Smaller wreaths work well on doors, entryways, or wall mounts, while larger ones can dominate a room. Consider the overall design of your room to ensure the wreath enhances rather than overwhelms. 


### Color and Style Options

Bunny wreaths come in various color palettes, from natural earthy tones to bright Easter colors. Match your choice to your existing decor while considering how the wreath will complement your overall Easter or spring-themed arrangements.

### What maintenance requirements do bunny wreaths have?

### How should I display multiple bunny wreaths?

When displaying multiple bunny wreaths, consider grouping them in odd numbers for a more natural and balanced look. Placing them at varying heights and angles creates depth and visual interest. 

You can also experiment with different arrangements, such as creating a tiered display or positioning them around a central focal point. The key is to maintain visual harmony while allowing each piece to be appreciated individually. 


### What materials are bunny wreaths typically made from?

Most bunny wreaths are crafted from resin or stone, which provide durability and weather resistance. These materials allow for detailed sculpting and can be finished with weather-resistant paints or coatings. 

Some higher-end models incorporate metal components for added durability, while more decorative versions might include painted features or additional elements like flower designs. The specific material composition can affect cleaning requirements and maintenance needs.
