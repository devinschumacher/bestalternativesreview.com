## FAQ

Each wallet is built to last, with reinforced stitching and solid brass hardware. The vegetable-tanning process locks in the natural oils, making the leather condition itself with use and developing a unique character with each owner. 


### How many cards can a Hooey wallet hold?

Our slim wallets accommodate approximately 12-15 credit cards or a combination of cards and bills, depending on their size. The versatile design allows you to carry both cards and notes without bulkiness. 

If you prefer a more minimalist approach, the compact versions hold around 10 cards while keeping your essentials accessible.

Regular maintenance keeps your Hooey wallet looking its best. Use a soft cloth to dust off dirt and wipe away any grime. For deeper cleaning, a mild soap and water solution works well, followed by a good drying.
