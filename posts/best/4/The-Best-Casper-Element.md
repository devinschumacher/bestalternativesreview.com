## Buyer's Guide

The Casper Element mattress blends performance features with a breathable, foam-core structure to deliver a comfortable sleep surface. Understanding its key components and intended use can help you determine if it suits your needs. 


### Mattress Core Construction

The Element features a 12-inch foam construction with a focus on pressure relief and motion isolation. It employs a blend of comfort layers and supportive core materials to balance softness with durability.

### Sleep Surface Temperature Regulation

Casper designed the Element with cooling properties through its foam materials and ventilation channels between the mattress layers. This combination helps maintain a comfortable sleeping temperature, reducing the likelihood of overheating during the night. 


### Motion Isolation and Partner Disturbance

The Element's structure is engineered to minimize movement transfer between sleepers. The firm pressure-relieving layers work to isolate individual sleep patterns, making it a suitable choice for couples where one partner may prefer a different firmness level than the other.

### Edge Support and Foundation Requirements

The foam construction provides good edge support, though not quite as pronounced as some innerspring alternatives. For optimal performance, it's recommended to use a mattress foundation that matches the Element's specifications to maintain consistent support across the sleep surface. 


## FAQ

![Casper-Element-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Casper-Element-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What makes the Casper Element mattress different from their regular Casper mattress?

The Casper Element mattress features a layer of memory foam cooling technology that helps regulate your body temperature during the night. This innovative design helps prevent hot spots and improves sleep quality by keeping you cool while you sleep. 

The Element also offers enhanced edge support due to its individually wrapped coils, making it ideal for side sleepers who like to sit up in bed. The combined cooling foam and premium coils create a more responsive support surface compared to their standard mattress. 


### How does the cooling system work in the Casper Element?

The cooling system in the Casper Element mattress uses a combination of Selective Surface technology and gel-infused foam. The Selective Surface material on the top layer helps wick away heat from your body, while the gel-infused foam provides targeted temperature regulation where it's needed most. 

These materials work together to create a ventilated sleep surface that allows air to circulate freely around your body, helping to prevent overheating during the night. 

![Casper-Element-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Casper-Element-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What kind of support does the Element mattress offer?

The Element mattress combines a supportive base layer with individually wrapped coils in the comfort layer. This design provides both stability and pressure relief, making it suitable for a wide range of sleep positions. 

However, side sleepers might find the mattress a bit too firm compared to their regular Casper mattress, while stomach sleepers could benefit from its enhanced edge support for better positioning. 


### Can the Element mattress be customized with different pillow options?

The Element mattress comes with a built-in pillow-top layer that provides enhanced comfort. While you can't replace this layer with different pillows, you can adjust the height of the built-in pillow to suit your specific needs. 

The mattress's high-quality foam construction means it maintains its shape well, so the pillow-top layer provides consistent support throughout its usable life. 

![Casper-Element-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Casper-Element-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How long does the cooling effect last?

The cooling properties of the Element mattress typically last between 6-8 hours, depending on your body temperature and sleep environment. During this period, the mattress maintains a cooler surface temperature compared to non-cooling mattress options. 

However, the mattress returns to normal temperature after the cooling layer has neutralized any remaining heat from your body, so its cooling effect is most noticeable during the initial sleeping hours. 


### What's included in the Element mattress package?

The Element mattress comes with a standard 10-inch thickness, featuring four distinct layers of foam and individually wrapped coils. Each mattress includes a 100-night sleep trial with free shipping both ways, a 10-year warranty, and a money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied. 

Additionally, the package includes a protective mattress cover and the option to add premium sleep accessories like sheets or a mattress foundation, though these are not included in the base price.
