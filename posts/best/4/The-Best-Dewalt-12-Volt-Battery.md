## Buyer's Guide

Dewalt 12-volt batteries power a wide range of tools, from cordless drills to circular saws. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the right battery for your needs. 


### Capacity and Runtime

Battery capacity is measured in amp hours (Ah). Higher capacity means more runtime for your tool. For example, a 4Ah battery will run longer than a 2Ah battery. Consider how long you need the tool to operate without recharging.

Look for batteries that charge fully in under 2 hours for convenience. Some advanced models offer smart charging features that prevent overcharging and protect the battery's lifespan. 


### Compatibility and System Integration

Ensure the battery is compatible with your Dewalt tool system. Check for the correct connector type and voltage rating. A battery designed for one tool may not work in another, even if they're from the same brand. 


### Maintenance and Long-term Care

Proper maintenance extends battery life. Store batteries fully charged and in a cool place when not in use. Avoid deep discharge cycles whenever possible.
