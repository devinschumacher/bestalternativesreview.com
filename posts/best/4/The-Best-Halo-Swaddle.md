## Buyer's Guide

A Halo swaddle is a popular sleep solution for newborns and young babies. These lightweight blankets help keep infants secure and comfortable while promoting healthy sleep patterns. When selecting a Halo swaddle, consider factors such as size, material, and ease of use to find the right fit for your family. 


### Size and Fit

Ensure the swaddle size matches your baby's age and weight. Newborn-sized swaddles are best for infants under 15 pounds, while larger swaddles accommodate bigger babies up to 30 pounds. The swaddle should securely wrap your baby without being too loose, allowing for comfortable movement while preventing startle reflex.

### Material Quality

The swaddle's material should be soft, breathable, and gentle on sensitive skin. Common materials include cotton blends, bamboo fiber, and microfiber. Look for pajamas made from pure cotton or certified organic materials for added safety and comfort. The fabric should allow air circulation to prevent overheating during sleep. 


### Ease of Use

Consider the swaddle's design for quick and secure application. Look for features like single-snap closures, elastic corners, or magnetic clasps that simplify the wrapping process. The swaddle should maintain its shape during use and remain secure throughout the night without frequent readjustments.

### Care and Durability

Choose a swaddle made from easily washable materials that maintain their shape after multiple washes. The blanket should resist shrinking and maintain its softness through regular use. Consider swaddles with reinforced stitching and durable closures for long-term reliability. 


## FAQ

![Halo-Swaddle-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Halo-Swaddle-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a Halo Swaddle?

A Halo Swaddle is a specialized infant sleep sack designed to keep newborns and young babies safely swaddled while allowing for easy diaper changes. The swaddle helps prevent startle reflex and promotes deep sleep. 

Key features include a secure wrap design with Velcro closure, breathable fabric, and roomy legs to prevent over-wrapping, which can be hazardous for infants. 


### What age range is the Halo Swaddle suitable for?

The Halo Swaddle is recommended for use from birth to approximately 3 months old, or until the baby reaches the maximum weight capacity of 25 pounds. 

Parents should transition to an appropriate sleep solution when their baby shows signs of attempting to roll over, as swaddling becomes less necessary after this milestone.

Start by lying the baby flat on their back in the swaddle, then tucking one arm at a time at the side of the body.

### Is the Halo Swaddle safe for babies with eczema or other skin conditions?

Yes, the breathable cotton material helps prevent overheating and provides a barrier against irritants that can exacerbate eczema. 

However, parents should monitor their baby's temperature and adjust swaddling tightness as needed to avoid excessive sweating. 


### Can I use a Halo Swaddle with a pacifier?

Yes, the design allows for easy pacifier attachment while keeping the baby swaddled securely. 

Some versions feature a built-in pacifier clip to help prevent loss or accidental removal during sleep.
