## Buyer's Guide

A bedside dresser serves as a practical addition to your bedroom, offering storage options for personal items while maintaining a clean bedroom aesthetic. When selecting the right dresser, consider several key factors to find a piece that meets your storage needs and enhances your room's design. 


### Storage Capacity and Style

Begin by assessing your storage requirements. Measure the available space in your bedroom and consider how many items you need to store. Bedside dressers typically range from three to six drawers, with some featuring additional compartments or doors for extra storage. Choose a style that complements your bedroom's existing furniture and design elements, considering both the finish and the number of drawers.

### Construction and Quality

The dresser's construction significantly impacts its longevity and stability. Look for pieces with solid wood or engineered wood construction, as these tend to be more durable than particle board. Check for sturdy joints and quality hardware, such as metal drawer glides and secure hinges. The quality of the finish should also be examined, as this affects both appearance and protection from scratches and damage. 


### Additional Features

Consider whether you need additional features beyond basic storage. Some dressers include adjustable shelves, which allow you to customize the interior layout for different storage needs. Look for dressers with additional compartments like slide-out trays for linens or a top shelf for decorative items. If you have children or pets, choose a dresser with safety features such as concealed locks on drawers.

### Budget and Warranty

Determine your budget before shopping, as this influences both the quality and style options available. Higher-priced dressers often come with better construction and features. Additionally, consider the length of any warranties offered by the manufacturer. A longer warranty indicates confidence in the product's quality and durability, providing added peace of mind. 


## FAQ

![Bedside-Dresser-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Bedside-Dresser-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What features should I consider when choosing a bedside dresser?

A good bedside dresser combines functionality with style. Consider the number of drawers you need based on your storage requirements. Standard dressers have 3-6 drawers, while wider variations might have more. 

Look for dressers with smooth-gliding drawer slides, quality construction materials like solid wood or metal, and ample space between drawers for easy access. The style should match your bedroom's existing furniture and dÃ©cor. 


### How do I measure for a bedside dresser?

Measure your available wall space, including the distance between furniture and the floor. Subtract the thickness of your nightstand from the overall wall space to determine the maximum width of the dresser. 

Measure the total height from the floor to the desired placement location, then add the height of the dresser to ensure it won't block doorways or create balance issues. 

![Bedside-Dresser-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Bedside-Dresser-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the benefits of glass drawer fronts?

Glass fronts offer a sleek, modern appearance and allow you to see what's inside your dresser. They're easy to clean and can add a touch of elegance to any bedroom. 

Use small glass panes for visual interest or solid glass for a more traditional look. Consider how much dust-proofing you need, as glass requires more frequent cleaning than solid materials. 


### Can I mix and match dresser styles and finishes?

Mixing styles works best when you find complementary elements, such as different finishes within the same color family or consistent design themes. Popular combinations include white painted dressers with aged bronze hardware or walnut dressers with gold accents. 

Evaluate how well different styles will blend based on their scale, shape, and detailing. Ensure consistent proportion in your furniture arrangements for a cohesive look. 

![Bedside-Dresser-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Bedside-Dresser-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What maintenance do drawer glide systems need?

Regularly check and adjust the alignment of drawer glides to ensure smooth operation. Apply lubricant to the runners and pivot points every 6-12 months, or when you notice increased resistance. 

Check for wear or damage to the glides every 1-2 years, replacing any components that show signs of fatigue or reduced performance. Proper maintenance extends the life of your dresser and ensures reliable operation. 


### How do I arrange multiple dressers in a room?

Group dressers in pairs or threes for balanced visual appeal. Arrange them against parallel walls or in an "L" shape to maximize storage while creating traffic flow. 

Consider the overall room dimensions and furniture placement when positioning dressers. Leave at least 30-40 inches between the dresser and other furniture for comfortable movement.
