## Buyer's Guide

Oxo paper towel holders are designed for both functionality and convenience, making them a popular choice for household use. When selecting an Oxo paper towel holder, several key features and considerations can help you find the right one for your needs. 


### Ergonomic Design and Spacing

Look for a holder that provides generous spacing between paper towel rolls to prevent tangling and ensure easy access. The ergonomic shape should allow for comfortable removal and replacement of rolls without strained bending or stretching. 


### Installation and Space Requirements

Measure your intended mounting area to ensure the holder fits properly. Consider the mounting options available â€“ wall-mounted, corner units, or countertop models â€“ and choose one that matches your available space and installation preferences. 


### Molding and Base Design

A well-molded base can prevent tipping and paper towel roll shifting. The molding style should integrate smoothly with your kitchen decor while providing enough stability to support standard paper towel rolls. 


### Material Quality and Durability

Sturdier materials like thick plastic or metal construction typically offer better durability and resistance to scratches or dents. Check for BPA-free certifications and resistance to harsh cleaning products if the holder will be exposed to these elements. 


## FAQ


### What makes Oxo paper towel holders different?

Oxo paper towel holders are known for their simple, elegant design that fits seamlessly into any kitchen. Their signature clip-top mechanism keeps rolls secure while allowing quick and easy access to towels.

These holders are made from durable plastic that withstands dishwashing, but the clips and mounting mechanisms may not always be dishwasher-safe. 


### How do Oxo holders prevent roll shifting?

Oxo holders prevent roll shifting with their proprietary clip design that holds rolls securely without flattening them. The clip locks in place while allowing for easy towel removal. 

Some models feature dual-clips or additional stabilizers for extra security with bulkier premium rolls.
