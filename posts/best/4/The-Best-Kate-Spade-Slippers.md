The Kate Spade Sabilla slippers combine a cozy leopard print faux fur upper with a cute pom-pom detail at the toe. They've got a synthetic lining and rubber outsole for some grip on your hardwood floors. While they're not perfect - some reviewers noted the seams are a bit too noticeable and the pom-pom fell off after just a few wears - many people still love how soft and comfy these slippers are. 


### [Kate Spade Play Hooky Berry Slippers](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Kate+Spade+Slippers?utm\_term=kate-spade-play-hooky-berry-slippers)

Combining luxurious velvet with plush faux fur, these playful slippers give your feet a royal treatment. The "Play Hooky" embroidery on the deep carnelian red pair strikes just the right balance between whimsy and relaxation, making them a stylish choice for those rare moments when you need to ditch your schedule and just unwind.

These Kate Spade slippers debut a pretty floral motif on parchment-colored leather, with the brand's signature lettering proudly displayed across the vamp. While they look absolutely charming for show-off pedicures, wearers might want to keep them indoors – one less-than-stellar review notes that the lettering faded after just a single wearing, making this pair's primary design feature vanish quicker than a summer breeze.

## Buyer's Guide

When selecting Kate Spade slippers, consider several key factors to find your perfect pair. Understanding the materials, craftsmanship, and specific features will help you choose slippers that match your style and needs. 


### Materials and Construction

Most Kate Spade slippers feature a polyurethane outsole for durability and non-slip grip. The uppers can be made from various materials like synthetic fabrics, fake fur, or mesh, each offering different levels of warmth and breathability. Higher-quality slippers often use more premium materials and stronger stitching for lasting comfort. 


### Style and Design

Known for their playful prints and pastel colors, Kate Spade slippers come in a variety of designs. Consider whether you prefer solid colors, animal prints, floral patterns, or more minimalist styles. The design should complement your personal taste and the overall look of your home. 


### Fit and Comfort

These slippers typically run true to size, though some styles may have different fits. It's important to measure your feet and try on several pairs to find the most comfortable option. Consider the heel height, arch support, and roominess of the toe box to ensure all-day wearability. 


### Care and Maintenance

Most Kate Spade slippersrequire minimal care. They wipe clean with a damp cloth and can be spot-treated for stains. To extend their life, store them in a cool, dry place and avoid direct sunlight. Using them as indoor footwear only will help maintain their appearance and quality. 


## FAQ


### What makes Kate Spade slippers unique?

The slippers typically include premium materials like plush sherpa lining and durable outer fabrics, though exact specifications vary by style. 


### Are Kate Spade slippers gender-neutral?

While many designs have universal appeal, Kate Spade creates separate styles for women and men, with sizing and fit parameters tailored to each gender. 

Mens' Kate Spade slippers generally feature a slightly wider toe box and more structured design, while womens' styles prioritize height and cushioning.

For the best results, store your slippers in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight to prevent color fading and fabric damage. 


### Are these slippers suitable for everyday wear?

While the plush interior and decorative elements make them ideal for lounging, the quality construction allows for occasional outdoor wear in mild weather. 

Avoid wearing them in damp environments or extreme temperatures, as this can affect the material's lifespan.

Prices typically range from $60 to $120, with premium designs featuring more elaborate materials and craftsmanship commanding higher prices.
