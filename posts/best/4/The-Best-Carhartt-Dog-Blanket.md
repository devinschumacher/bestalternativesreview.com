A Carhartt dog blanket combines warmth and durability for your furry friend. These blankets typically feature water-resistant construction and insulating materials to keep your pet cozy in various weather conditions. 


### Size and Fit

Measure your dog to ensure the blanket fits properly. Most blankets come in standard sizes, but some may offer additional length options for larger breeds. The blanket should cover your pet's body while allowing enough room for movement. 


### Materials and Coating

Water-resistant polyester or cotton blends are common. Look for a breathable inner layer to prevent overheating. Some blankets feature a slightly raised surface on one side for added comfort and grip.

Choose a blanket with a convenient storage solution, such as a roll-up design or mesh bag. Machine washable materials make cleaning simple, but check the care instructions for specific guidelines.

## FAQ


### What materials are used in Carhartt dog blankets?

The Large blanket typically covers dogs up to 80 lbs, while the Medium works well for 45-80 lb dogs. For smaller pets (under 45 lbs), the Small size provides ample coverage and comfort. 


### How do I care for a Carhartt dog blanket?

Care for your Carhartt dog blanket much like you would a quality cotton sheet. Machine wash in cold water using mild detergent, ensuring the blanket is the only load to prevent snagging. The blanket can also be tumble dried on low or line-dried to maintain its shape and quality. 

Avoid using bleach or fabric softeners as they can damage the microfiber coating. If needed, spot-clean especially soiled areas before washing to maintain the blanket's appearance and performance. 


### How does the microfiber coating affect the blanket?

The microfiber coating on the blanket's surface increases its insulation properties while making it extremely water-resistant. This means your dog stays warm in cold weather but dry in mild rain or dew. 

The coating also prevents static cling and keeps the blanket's color vibrant over time. While the coating gives it a premium feel, it's still machine-washable and maintains its shape through regular use. 


### Can these blankets be machine washed?

Yes, Carhartt dog blankets are fully machine washable, which is convenient for regular cleaning. Use the gentle cycle with cold water and a mild detergent to preserve the blanket's quality and prevent shrinking. 

The blankets can also be dried in a dryer on low heat or air-dried to maintain their shape and prevent over-drying, which might shrink some cotton fabrics. 


### Are these blankets suitable for outdoor use?

The combination of 100% cotton construction and water-resistant microfiber coating makes these blankets ideal for outdoor use. They protect your dog from dew in the early morning or light rain, while the cotton keeps them comfortable during cooler outdoor activities. 

While they're not designed for heavy rainfall or swimming, the blankets are appropriate for a variety of outdoor settings, from car rides to overnight stays in a covered outdoor space.
