## Buyer's Guide

Ballistic glasses provide superior eye protection by meeting rigorous military and law enforcement standards. These specialized goggles incorporate multiple layers of polycarbonate or trivex materials to dissipate impact energy and prevent penetration. 


### Impact Resistance Standards

Choose glasses that meet ANSI Z87.1 or military Mil-Spec 19173 standards. These certifications ensure the lenses can withstand high-velocity impacts from fragments, bullets, and projectiles. 


### Field of Vision

Evaluation windows typically offer at least 112-degree horizontal field of view. Premium models expand this to 120 degrees, providing better peripheral visibility during rapid target acquisition. 


### Comfort and Fit

Proper fit is essential for extended wear. The glasses should sit securely on the face without sliding or causing pressure points. Adjustable nose bridges and ear clasps accommodate various facial structures. 


### Additional Features

Look for multi-layer coating for scratch resistance and UV protection. Some models include adjustable airflow vents to prevent fogging and enhance breathability during intense activities. 


## FAQ


### What are ballistic glasses?

Ballistic glasses, also known as CE certified glasses, are designed to meet European safety standards for eye protection against flying debris and projectiles. These glasses incorporate specialized polycarbonate lenses and robust frames to provide superior impact resistance compared to standard eyewear. 

The CE marking ensures that these glasses meet rigorous European Union safety standards, including impact testing requirements for both the lens and frame. Proper CE certification indicates that the glasses can withstand impact from various projectiles traveling at different speeds and angles. 


### What makes CE certification important for ballistic glasses?

CE certification ensures that ballistic glasses meet the mandatory European safety standards for personal protective equipment. This certification process involves comprehensive testing of both the lens materials and frame construction to verify their durability and protective capabilities. 

While CE certification is essential for meeting legal requirements in the European Union, it also provides assurance that the glasses are manufactured to consistent quality standards and undergo rigorous testing for safety and durability. 


### How do ballistic glasses compare to standard safety glasses?

Standard safety glasses typically use standard glass or plastic lenses and may lack the specialized materials and construction techniques used in ballistic glasses. While standard safety glasses provide basic protection against dust and debris, ballistic glasses offer significantly higher impact resistance, particularly against high-velocity projectiles. 

The primary difference lies in the lens material and construction: ballistic glasses use military-grade polycarbonate or comparable materials, while standard safety glasses often use basic plastic or glass. Frame construction also varies, with ballistic glasses featuring reinforced structures to maintain their protective properties. 


### Can ballistic glasses be worn for extended periods?

While ballistic glasses provide excellent protection, they may not be suitable for long-term wear in all environments due to their weight and construction. These glasses are best suited for short-term, high-risk situations where impact protection is essential. 

Extended wear can cause discomfort due to the glasses' robust design and may affect peripheral vision. For regular use or environments with lower risk of impact, standard safety glasses or prescription safety glasses may be more appropriate. 


### What maintenance requirements do ballistic glasses have?

Ballistic glasses should be cleaned regularly using mild soap and water or lens cleaning solutions specifically designed for optical glasses. The frames should be checked for wear and tear, particularly around the temples and hinges, which may need adjustment or replacement. 

Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners that could damage the lens coating or frame material. If the lenses become scratched or the frame shows significant wear, the glasses should be replaced to maintain their protective properties. 


### Can prescription lenses be used in ballistic glasses?

Many ballistic glasses are compatible with prescription lenses, allowing users to maintain their corrected vision while providing protective eyewear. Prescription inserts or full-frame glasses with CE certification are common options for those requiring corrective lenses. 

It's important to obtain prescription lenses specifically designed for ballistic glasses, as standard prescription lenses may not meet the necessary safety standards. Always verify that any prescription lenses used in ballistic glasses conform to CE certification requirements.
