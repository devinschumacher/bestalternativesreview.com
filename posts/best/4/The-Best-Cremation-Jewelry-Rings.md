These rings combine a hollowed-out band design capable of holding cremated remains with intricate detailing that reflects the wearer's style and the deceased's personality.

Look for pieces made from high-quality precious metals like 14k or 18k gold, platinum, or sterling silver, which resist wear and maintain their luster. The internal capacity varies between 1-2 grams of ashes, so consider the ring size before finalizing the design.

## FAQ


### What is cremation jewelry, and how does it work?

Cremation jewelry combines the remains of a loved one with specially treated metal to create a piece of jewelry. The process typically involves placing cremated ashes into a small metal container, which is then mixed with molten metal. The metal hardens around the ashes, creating a permanent keepsake. 

Common forms of cremation jewelry include rings, necklaces, and bracelets. These pieces can have varying levels of metal coverage—some may show a small amount of the metal's original color, while others can be nearly solid metal, depending on personal preference and design choices. 


### How much ash can typically be used in cremation jewelry?

The amount of ash that can be incorporated into jewelry depends on the size of the piece and the specific design. A standard ring might accommodate about 1-2 grams of ash, while larger pieces like pendants could hold up to 5 grams. 

Most manufacturers provide guidelines for the maximum amount of ash that can be safely used in their designs. It's best to check with the specific jewelry maker to determine the appropriate quantity for your chosen piece. 


### What materials are commonly used in cremation jewelry?

Cremation jewelry frequently uses precious metals like gold, silver, or platinum, along with various colored metals for customization options. These metals undergo a special thermal process to create a durable bond with the ashes. 

Some pieces incorporate gemstones, pearls, or enamel work to enhance the design. Precious metals typically range from 14k to 24k in purity, with higher numbers indicating more gold content. 


### Can you choose the design for a custom cremation jewelry piece?

Customization options vary by designer, but many offer a wide range of styles for cremation jewelry. This can include classic designs like solitaires, halo settings, and bezel-set stones, as well as contemporary options like minimalist bands or intricate engravings. 

You can often specify details such as metal type, stone preferences, and personal engravings. However, some technical considerations may affect design choices, such as the specific metal treatment process used by the jeweler. 


### How long does the cremation jewelry process take?

The production timeline for cremation jewelry typically ranges from 4 to 8 weeks, though this can vary based on the complexity of the design and the jeweler's workload. Most reputable jewelers provide a detailed timeline when you begin the customization process. 

During this time, the jewelry piece undergoes several steps including metal casting, ash incorporation, polishing, and final inspection before it's ready for delivery. 


### How should you maintain a cremation jewelry piece?

To keep your cremation jewelry in optimal condition, follow standard jewelry care practices. This includes regular cleaning with mild soap and water, avoiding harsh chemicals, and storing the piece in a soft cloth or jewelry box when not worn. 

Most cremation jewelry pieces maintain their shine through regular cleaning. If you notice any changes in the piece's appearance or structure, it's advisable to have it professionally inspected and cleaned.
