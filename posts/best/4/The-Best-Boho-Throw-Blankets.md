Cleaning requirements vary by material, but most boho throw blankets can be machine washed. For cotton and wool blends, use cold water and gentle detergents to prevent color bleeding and damage. Linen blankets typically require hand washing or gentle machine washing with mild soap. Always follow the care instructions provided by the manufacturer, including recommended water temperature and drying methods. 

Regular maintenance includes spot cleaning for spills and airing out the blanket to remove dust. Storage should be in a cool, dry place to prevent matting and preserve the material's texture. Avoid folding heavily as this can create permanent wrinkles and damage the fabric.
