## Buyer's Guide

Stuart Weitzman combat boots combine fashionable design with military-inspired durability. These versatile boots require careful consideration of several key factors to find the perfect pair.

### Military-Inspired Features

These boots incorporate genuine military elements like Vibram sole units, steel toe caps, and G-Flex heel counters. The Vibram outsoles provide superior traction and durability. The steel toes meet ASTM F2413-11 M voltage protection standards. The G-Flex heel counters enhance stability and reduce fatigue during extended wear.

### How should I care for these boots?

Regular maintenance involves cleaning with a soft cloth and leather conditioner to keep the material supple and prevent cracking. The rubber soles benefit from occasional polishing with appropriate products. 

Store the boots in a cool, dry place when not in use to protect them from extreme temperatures and moisture damage. 


### What sizing options are available?

The boots come in a standard range of sizes, typically from US 6 to US 11. Stuart Weitzman recommends measuring your feet and comparing them to their size chart for the most accurate fit. 

Due to the boots' reinforced construction, they generally run slightly narrower than standard footwear, so sizing up a half size may be recommended for those between sizes.
