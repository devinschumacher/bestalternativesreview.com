## Buyer's Guide

A properly fitted dental guard is essential for protecting your teeth and oral health during sports or nighttime teeth clenching. Not all guards are created equal, so understanding the key features and considerations can help you choose the right protection for your needs. 


### Materials and Durability

The guard's material quality directly impacts its longevity and effectiveness. Common options include polyethylene, thermoplastic, and acrylic. Polyethylene and thermoplastic guards offer good impact resistance and flexibility, with thermoplastic being slightly more durable. Acrylic guards are softer but less resistant to wear over time. For high-impact activities, opt for a thermoplastic guard that can be professionally fitted for maximum protection. 


### Fit and Comfort

A proper fit is crucial for a dental guard to be effective and comfortable. It should sit smoothly against your teeth without creating pressure points or interferes with normal mouth movements. Look for guards that offer adjustable closures or multiple fitting options to achieve the right fit. Proper fitting reduces the risk of displacement during use and ensures consistent protection. 


### Customization Options

Professional fitting services can significantly enhance a dental guard's effectiveness and comfort. Custom guards are heat molded to your teeth for precise fit and superior protection. While more expensive, they offer advantages over stock guards, particularly for contact sports or bruxism cases. Budget models typically include basic bite planes that can be adjusted at home, providing some customization without professional assistance. 


### Maintenance and Cleaning

Proper care extends a dental guard's lifespan and maintains its hygiene. Most guards should be cleaned daily with mild soap and water, and professionally cleaned periodically. They need regular inspection for signs of wear or damage. All guards should be transported in protective cases to prevent deformation. For custom guards, professional cleaning and maintenance visits are recommended to ensure ongoing effectiveness. 


## FAQ


### What is a Dentek Dental Guard?

A Dentek Dental Guard is a protective oral appliance designed to prevent dental injuries by covering the teeth and sensitive areas of the mouth. It's particularly useful for individuals involved in contact sports or activities where there's a risk of oral trauma. 

The guard works by creating a barrier between the teeth and potential impact points, helping to absorb shock and distribute pressure evenly. This protective layer helps prevent tooth damage, chipping, and other oral injuries. 


### What makes Dentek Dental Guards different from other mouthguards?

Dentek stands out by offering both standard and custom-fit options, with their premium models featuring dual-density material that provides enhanced protection and comfort. The standard guards offer a cost-effective solution with reliable protection, while custom guards offer superior fit and mobility for active wear. 

Another key feature is the inclusion of a finger tab in their guards, which helps secure the mouthguard in place during intense activities. The material composition ranges from softer to firmer options depending on the model, catering to various user preferences and levels of activity. 


### Who should consider using a Dentek Dental Guard?

The primary users are individuals participating in contact sports like football, hockey, and martial arts, where the risk of dental injury is highest. However, they're also recommended for recreational activities such as skateboarding, gymnastics, and cycling to protect against accidental falls or collisions. 

Elderly individuals who wear dentures or have loose teeth may also benefit, as the guard helps prevent dental injuries that could dislodge teeth or damage dentures. 


### How do I clean and maintain my Dentek Guard?

Regular cleaning is essential for maintaining hygiene and preventing bacteria buildup. After each use, rinse the guard thoroughly with water. For deeper cleaning, use mild soap and a soft-bristled toothbrush. Avoid using bleach or harsh chemicals that can damage the material. 

Store the guard in its provided case when not in use. The case should be clean and dry to prevent mold growth. Replace the guard every 6-12 months, or sooner if it shows signs of wear, becomes discolored, or no longer fits properly. 


### How long does it take to get a custom Dentek Guard?

Custom-fit Dentek Guards typically require a two-week processing time. The process begins with an in-office impression of your teeth, followed by laboratory customization. During this period, you can use a Boil and Bite guard as a temporary solution until your custom guard is ready. 

If you need immediate protection, a Boil and Bite guard can be softened and shaped in about 30 minutes at home. This provides temporary protection while you're waiting for your custom guard to arrive. 


### What should I consider when choosing between standard and custom options?

Standard Dentek Guards are a budget-friendly choice that's easy to maintain, requiring only simple shaping to fit your mouth. They're suitable for occasional users or those who prefer a less expensive option. The Boil and Bite process takes about 30 minutes, making them practical for quick protection. 

Custom guards offer superior fit, comfort, and protection, especially for users with specific dental needs. They're recommended for regular users of dental guards, those with complex dental work, or anyone who wants the best possible protection for their oral health.
