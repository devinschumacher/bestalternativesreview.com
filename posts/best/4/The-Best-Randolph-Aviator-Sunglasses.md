Understanding the key aspects of these sunglasses will help you choose a pair that matches your style preferences and lifestyle needs. 


### Lens Characteristics

The lenses in Randolph aviator sunglasses typically offer several important features. Photochromic lenses automatically adjust their darkness based on light conditions, while polarized lenses reduce glare from reflective surfaces like water or roads. The tint color and category rating indicate the lenses' light filtration capabilities, with higher numbers providing more protection from bright sunlight. 


### Frame Design and Materials

Randolph aviator sunglasses feature frames that incorporate the brand's signature styling elements, such as bold angles and distinctive clip-on attachments. The frame material can range from lightweight plastic to durable metals, with each option offering different levels of comfort and longevity. Consider how the frame material and design will affect your glasses' weight and ability to stay in place during various activities. 


### Sizing and Fit

To ensure proper fit and comfort, measured frame sizing is crucial when selecting Randolph aviator sunglasses. The temple length, nose pad width, and lens size all impact how the glasses sit on your face. Consider your face shape when choosing a style, as certain designs may look more flattering on specific facial types. Proper fit prevents sliding and ensures optimal lens placement for consistent vision correction. 


### Additional Features and Accessories

Many Randolph aviator sunglasses come with additional features that enhance their functionality and style. These may include clip-on sunglasses for changing light conditions, protective hard cases for storage, and microfiber cleaning cloths for maintenance. Examining what accessories come with your chosen pair helps ensure you have everything needed to keep your glasses protected and clean. 


## FAQ


### What makes Randolph aviator sunglasses unique?

Randolph aviator sunglasses combine timeless styling with advanced functionality, featuring lightweight polycarbonate frames and UV protection up to 400 nm. The distinctive wraparound design enhances visual clarity and reduces glare. 

The brand's proprietary High Definition Optics technology significantly reduces chromatic aberration and increases color accuracy, delivering superior visual performance compared to standard sunglasses. 


### What sizes are available?

Randolph offers multiple frame sizes to accommodate different face shapes and preferences, including sizes 4, 5, 6, and 7. Each size has specific lens dimensions for optimal fit and comfort. 

For a precise measurement, use the brand's online sizing guide, which recommends the best size based on your facial dimensions and preference for frame style. 


### How do I care for my Randolph sunglasses?

Randolph recommends cleaning your glasses daily with a microfiber cloth to maintain optimal clarity and appearance. For tougher grime, use mild soap and water, avoiding harsh chemicals or abrasive materials. 

Avoid exposing your Randolph sunglasses to extreme temperatures, direct heat, or strong cleaning products, which can damage the frame or lenses. Store them in the provided case when not in use. 


### What materials are used in Randolph sunglasses?

Randolph primarily uses polycarbonate for the frames, chosen for its lightweight properties and impact resistance. The lenses are typically made from optical-quality glass or polycarbonate, depending on the model. 

Some models incorporate premium materials like titanium for the nose bridge, providing additional durability and a more premium feel. Check the specific product page for material details. 


### What level of UV protection do these sunglasses offer?

Look for the UV protection rating on the product page to verify the level of protection. For everyday wear, a minimum of 99% UV protection is recommended. 


### How do I find my perfect pair?

Start by measuring your face width to determine the best Randolph frame size. Most models offer a 1-inch adjustment in temple length, so measure your existing glasses or your face width to find the closest match. 

Visit a Randolph retailer for a professional fitting if possible. They can help ensure the temples sit comfortably behind your ears and the lenses sit level on your face.
