### What makes a good T Rex toy?

A quality T Rex toy combines durability, realistic details, and appropriate size for its intended age group. The best T Rex toys are made from impact-resistant materials like ABS plastic or durable rubber. 

Look for features like articulated limbs, accurate skeletal details, and interchangeable parts for enhanced play value. The toy should be at least 12 inches long for easy grasping by children ages 3-6, with smaller versions suitable for younger hands. 


### What ages are T Rex toys suitable for?

T Rex toys can be found in various sizes and complexities, making them suitable for different age groups. Smaller, simpler toys are ideal for toddlers as young as 18 months, while larger, more detailed versions are appropriate for children aged 3-6.

Since T Rex toys often become play objects for various activities, durability is crucial. Look for materials like ABS plastic or high-quality resilient rubber that can withstand chewing, dropping, and general rough play.

Articulated limbs that can move independently increase a T Rex toy's play value by allowing children to create different poses and scenes. Many modern T Rex toys feature multiple movable parts, including the head, arms, and tail.
