## Buyer's Guide

A well-chosen Igloo Playmate cooler can transform your pet's playtime into a chilled-ther fun session, especially during summer outings. Here's what to consider to find the perfect fit for your furry friend. 


### Size and Shape

With various options including rectangular, oval, and cooler mats, the right shape depends on your space and how you plan to use it. The volume capacity helps determine how much you can cool at once – typically measured in liters or quarts. 


### Insulation Quality

The wall thickness and materials affect how long contents stay cold. Look for indicators like the U-value rating, where a lower number means better insulation. Additionally, check if the cooler has a double-wall design to maintain its shape and integrity. 


### Convenience Features

Carry options like a shoulder strap or harness attach point are essential for active dogs. Some models include mesh drainage for water-filled toys, while lids with built-in water bowls can be practical for long trips. 


### Material Durability

The cooler's shell material should be BPA-free and resistant to scratches and cracks, especially if your pet likes to gnaw or chew around new items. The ease of cleaning and maintenance also affect its durability over time.
