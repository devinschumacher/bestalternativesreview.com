## Buyer's Guide

Wellness cat food wet varieties offer several advantages over dry food, including higher moisture content which helps with hydration and digestion. These meals typically feature real meat as the primary ingredient, though some contain plant-based proteins suitable for vegetarian diets. 


### Nutritional Content

When evaluating wet food, consider the protein source and quality. Look for products that list meat as the first ingredient, with minimal fillers like by-products or artificial preservatives. For cats with specific dietary needs, such as kidney disease, check if the food has been formulated for therapeutic use.

### Portion Control

Pet food packaging often includes feeding guides, but these may not account for your cat's individual needs. Start with the recommended amount and adjust based on your cat's weight, activity level, and overall health. Regular veterinary check-ups can help determine proper portion sizes. 


### Storage and Freshness

Untopped cans of wet food can stay fresh for 5-7 days when refrigerated, while opened pouches should be used within 2-3 days. Always check the food for signs of spoilage before serving, such as unusual odors or changes in texture. Fresh ingredients are crucial, especially for cats with sensitive stomachs or allergies.

Introducing wet food should be done gradually to prevent digestive upset. Mix small amounts with the current diet, increasing the proportion of wet food over 7-10 days. This transition helps maintain consistent nutrition while providing beneficial moisture and potential digestive benefits. 


## FAQ

![Wellness-Cat-Food-Wet-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Wellness-Cat-Food-Wet-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What makes Wellness wet cat food different from other brands?

Wellness wet cat food stands out with its Complete & Balanced nutrition guaranteed for all life stages. Unlike some competitors, their recipes focus on real meat as the first ingredient, paired with natural vitamins and minerals rather than artificial additives. 

Each meal contains no artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives, making it a healthier choice for your cat's diet compared to many premium brands on the market. 


### Can I feed my cat only Wellness wet food?

While Wellness wet food provides complete nutrition, it's important to note that prolonged exclusive wet food diets may not meet all your cat's nutritional needs. A balanced approach combining both wet and dry food is ideal for most cats. 

That said, if your pet suffers from digestive issues or health conditions that require specialized diet management, consulting with a veterinarian about an all-wet food diet may be appropriate. 

![Wellness-Cat-Food-Wet-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Wellness-Cat-Food-Wet-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What types of ingredients should I look for in Wellness wet food?

The best Wellness wet foods feature real meat as the primary ingredient, followed by water and natural ingredients like fruits, vegetables, or whole grains. These foods are rich in proteins, vitamins, and minerals necessary for your cat's health. 

Avoid products containing by-products, artificial additives, or excessive grain content. The ingredient list should align with your chosen nutritional goals for your pet. 


### How much Wellness wet food should I feed my cat?

Feeding amounts vary based on your cat's age, weight, and activity level. As a general guideline, smaller cats and those with lower energy needs should consume about 4-6 oz per meal, while larger breeds may need up to 8-10 oz. 

Always monitor your cat's body condition and adjust portion sizes accordingly. Overfeeding, even with healthy foods, can lead to obesity and related health issues. 

![Wellness-Cat-Food-Wet-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Wellness-Cat-Food-Wet-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Is Wellness wet food safe for all breeds and sizes?

Wellness wet food formulas are designed to support the general nutritional needs of cats across different breeds and sizes. Their Complete & Balanced recipes work well for most domestic cats, from kittens to senior pets. 

However, cats with specific dietary requirements or health conditions should consult a veterinarian before switching to a new food, including Wellness wet food. 


### Can I mix Wellness wet food with other types of wet food?

Mixing different brands and types of wet food usually works well for most cats. This approach can help maintain nutritional variety and potentially reduce pickiness. However, introducing new foods gradually is recommended to avoid digestive upset. 

Special dietary requirements or specific health conditions may need careful consideration when mixing foods. Always prioritize your cat's overall health and nutritional needs when making dietary changes.
