### What is a spy gadget?

A spy gadget is an electronic device used for covert surveillance, information gathering, or data transmission. These devices can range from simple recording pens to sophisticated cameras that transmit live feeds to remote devices. 

They are often used in law enforcement, intelligence operations, and personal security applications where traditional methods of surveillance are insufficient or impractical.

Advanced models feature facial recognition software, GPS tracking capabilities, and encrypted data transmission to protect the captured information. 


### How do spy gadgets work?

Most spy gadgets function by covertly recording audio or video, tracking location, or transmitting data to remote devices. They typically use internal storage to store information until it can be downloaded or transmitted.
