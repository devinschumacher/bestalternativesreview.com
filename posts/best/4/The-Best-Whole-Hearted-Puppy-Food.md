## Buyer's Guide

When selecting puppy food, it's essential to consider a formula specifically designed for young dogs. Whole hearted puppy food typically offers a comprehensive nutrient profile to support growth and development. Look for balanced protein levels from quality sources, along with essential vitamins and minerals. 


### Nutrient Profile

Puppy food should contain adequate levels of protein, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. The protein source should be high-quality animal protein rather than plant-based alternatives. Essential fatty acids like omega-3 and omega-6 help with skin and coat health. 


### Protein Quality and Source

Select foods that list animal protein as the primary ingredient. Common high-quality sources include chicken, beef, lamb, and fish. The protein should be easily digestible for young puppies, which typically requires smaller protein molecules. 


### Vitamin and Mineral Content

A complete puppy food should contain appropriate levels of calcium, phosphorus, and other minerals for bone development. Essential vitamins include A, D, E, and K. Some formulas may also include antioxidants and probiotics for digestive health. 


### Additional Considerations

Consult with your veterinarian about your puppy's specific nutritional needs based on breed, size, and health. Consider any dietary restrictions or sensitivities your puppy might have. Always introduce new foods gradually to prevent gastrointestinal upset.
