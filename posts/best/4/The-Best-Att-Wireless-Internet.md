## FAQ

![Att-Wireless-Internet-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Att-Wireless-Internet-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is Att Wireless Internet?

Att Wireless Internet is a high-speed internet service provided by AT&T Wireless. It combines AT&T's wireless technology with fiber-optic infrastructure to deliver broadband internet access to both residential and business customers. 

The service offers a range of plans with speeds up to 1 Gbps, suitable for various usage needs including streaming, gaming, and professional work. It's designed to be more reliable and less congested than traditional wireless internet options. 


### How does Att Wireless Internet work?

Att's wireless internet system uses a combination of small cell infrastructure and fiber-optic connections to deliver high-speed internet. The system works by placing small, local cell sites throughout neighborhoods and business districts. 

When you connect to the service, your device communicates with the nearest cell site via a wireless signal. This signal is then routed through fiber-optic cables to a local internet exchange point, where it connects to the broader internet backbone. 

![Att-Wireless-Internet-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Att-Wireless-Internet-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What devices are compatible with Att Wireless Internet?

Att Wireless Internet supports a wide range of devices, including computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The service works with both Windows and Mac operating systems, as well as various Android and iOS devices. 

Most modern devices should be compatible out of the box. However, for optimal performance, it's recommended to use the latest firmware versions and check for any specific requirements or recommendations from AT&T. 


### What are the coverage areas for Att Wireless Internet?

Att Wireless Internet coverage is primarily available in urban and suburban areas where AT&T has deployed its small cell infrastructure. The service is expanding rapidly, with new coverage areas being added regularly.

### What's the difference between Att Wireless Internet and traditional home internet?

The key difference is in the delivery method. Traditional home internet typically uses copper wires, cable, or fiber-optic cables directly connected to your home. In contrast, Att Wireless Internet uses wireless signals between your device and local cell sites, with fiber-optic connections between those sites. 

This wireless approach offers several advantages, including reduced congestion, improved reliability, and faster speeds. However, the availability and performance can vary based on how many users are connected in your area. 


### How do I get started with Att Wireless Internet?

To get started, visit the official AT&T website or call their customer service to determine if your location is covered and to request service. You'll need to provide your address and contact information. 

Once you're approved, you'll receive a small wireless modem and router that you can install at home. The service typically begins within 1-2 business days after installation. For business customers, additional equipment and setup services may be available.
