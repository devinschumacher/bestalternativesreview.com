## Buyer's Guide

A Bissell steam cleaner uses pressurized steam to clean floors and surfaces without harsh chemicals. Understanding the key aspects of these machines will help you find the right one for your cleaning needs. 


### Steam Power and Temperature

Steam cleaners create powerful, high-temperature vapor that effectively sanitizes surfaces. The cleaning power comes from steam pressure and temperature, typically between 180-212°F. Higher temperatures deliver more effective cleaning but require more water.

### Versatility and Accessories

Consider a model with multiple attachments for different cleaning needs. Common accessories include a crevice tool for tight spaces, a dusting brush for delicate surfaces, and a stain remover tip for targeted treatments. The machine's versatility affects its overall cleaning capabilities. 


### Size and Mobility

Bissell steam cleaners come in various sizes, from compact handheld models to full-size machines. Handheld models are convenient for quick cleanups, while larger models offer more cleaning power but require more storage space. Consider how you'll move the machine around your home.
