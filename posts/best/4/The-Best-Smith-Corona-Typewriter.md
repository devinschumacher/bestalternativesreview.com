The manual typewriter from Smith-Corona that you're likely considering has developed a bit of a reputation, with some users reporting issues with both the seller and the condition of the item received. It's worth noting that while it comes with a protective case and has survived regular use, the current setup requires a new ribbon to get back to typing. The overall experience is mixed â€“ one buyer mentions light cosmetic wear from use, while another had a much more frustrating time due to damaged goods and misleading claims from the seller.

## Buyer's Guide

The Smith Corona typewriter represents a legacy of quality mechanical design and reliable performance. When choosing a Smith Corona typewriter, several key features and considerations will help you select the right model for your needs. 


### Mechanical Functionality

Smith Corona typewriters are known for their robust construction and precise mechanics. The quality of the typebar mechanism affects character formation and durability. Models with individual key typebars (unlike solid metal plates) generally offer better character definition and longer lifespan. The weight and balance of the typebars contribute to smoother typing action. 


### Keyboard and Layout

The keyboard layout determines typing efficiency and comfort. Standard QWERTY layout with numerical keypad is most common. Consider finger placement and reach when selecting a model. Some professional models feature extended numeric keypads and dedicated function keys for various document formatting tasks. 


### Build Quality and Materials

The robustness of metal construction and attention to detail in assembly indicate a quality typewriter. Check for solid feel in the frame and keyboard, with no wobbling or loose parts. The ribbon case design affects access and protection - larger cases with secure closures are preferable for storage. 


### Special Features

Additional features enhance usability and versatility. Keyboard light indicators for function keys aid navigation in low light. Ribbon tension adjustment ensures consistent character impression without frequent replacement. Consider models with built-in ruler guides for precise measurement tasks. 


## FAQ


### What makes the Smith Corona typewriter unique?

Smith Cora typewriters are prized for their reliable mechanical design and robust construction, featuring durable metal parts and precise engineering. These typewriters stand out with their smooth keystroke action and quiet operation, thanks to their proprietary technology. 

The brand's commitment to quality is evident in its typewriters' longevity and minimal maintenance requirements, making them a practical choice for both casual and professional users. 


### How do I care for my Smith Corona typewriter?

Regular maintenance includes cleaning the typewriter's mechanism with a soft cloth and air duster to remove debris. The typewheel should be cleaned regularly with isopropyl alcohol and a cotton swab. 

After use, wipe down the exterior with a damp cloth and mild soap, ensuring it's completely dry before storage to prevent rust. 


### What's the difference between the Smith Corona Sovereign and Selectric?

The Smith Corona Sovereign features traditional typebars for character formation, while the Selectric uses a ball mechanism for smoother character selection. The Selectric requires less force during typing and produces less noise. 

Each model offers distinct advantages: typebars provide consistent character quality, while the ball mechanism reduces operator fatigue during extended use. 


### Can I still get parts and service for my Smith Corona?

Original parts remain available through Smith Corona's official parts catalog and selected retailers. The brand maintains a parts availability database to help locatecompatible components. 

Regular service centers and skilled technicians specialize in Smith Corona repairs, ensuring your typewriter maintains its top performance. 


### What's the difference between manual and electric Smith Corona models?

Manual models rely on the operator's force for character formation, providing precise control and a satisfying typing experience. Electric models offer a typing return mechanism powered by a motor, reducing finger fatigue during extended use. 

Electric models incorporate a keyboard-powered typing return, while manual models require the writer to manually return the carriage after each line. 


### How do I know if a Smith Corona is worth buying?

A valuable Smith Corona typically features a solid metal frame, unibody construction, and original components. The keyboard should remain aligned, with no noticeable wobble in the mechanisms. 

Check for proper function of all keys and smooth operation of the carriage. Cosmetic damage is acceptable, but avoid models with significant rust, missing parts, or missing keys.
