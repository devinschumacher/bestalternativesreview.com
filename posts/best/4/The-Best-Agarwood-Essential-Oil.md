### Quality and Authenticity

The quality of agarwood essential oil varies significantly. Look for oils that are pure, without synthetic additives. Authentic agarwood oil features deep, earthy tones with hints of spice and vanilla. Be cautious of overly potent or artificially fragranced products, as these may be adulterated.
