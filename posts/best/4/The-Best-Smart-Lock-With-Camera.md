## Buyer's Guide

A smart lock with camera combines physical security with video surveillance, offering homeowners and renters enhanced protection and peace of mind. These devices typically integrate a traditional lock mechanism with camera capabilities, allowing users to monitor and control access to their property from anywhere via a smartphone app. 


### Core Features to Consider

When selecting a smart lock with camera, the most crucial features include video quality, night vision, and storage options. Video resolution determines the clarity of footage, while night vision ensures visibility in low-light conditions. Storage options affect how long recordings can be retained, with local storage providing immediate access and cloud storage offering backup and sharing capabilities. 


### Compatibility and Integration

Ensure the lock works seamlessly with your existing smart home ecosystem. Look for devices that support popular platforms like Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or Apple HomeKit. Additionally, check if the lock can be integrated with smart doorbells or other security systems to create a comprehensive home security network. 


### Access Control and Sharing

Effective access control is essential for managing who can enter your property. Smart locks with camera typically allow creation of multiple user profiles with varying permissions. Consider features like temporary access codes, biometric authentication, and precise activity monitoring to maintain control over who enters your space. 


### Power and Battery Life

Reliability is critical for security systems, so choose a lock with robust power options. Options include battery-powered models with backup power sources, hardwired installations, or wireless connectivity with reliable signal strength. Battery life should last at least a year between charges, and the lock should maintain functionality during power outages.
