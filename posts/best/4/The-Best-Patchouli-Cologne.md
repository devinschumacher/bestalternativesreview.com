![Patchouli-Cologne-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Patchouli-Cologne-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Intensity and Longevity

Intensity levels range from light to heavy, affecting how noticeable the fragrance is throughout the day. Longer-lasting formulas are ideal for workplaces or formal occasions, while lighter scents suit casual settings. Consider your daily activities and environment when choosing a fragrance's longevity. 


### Quality of Ingredients
