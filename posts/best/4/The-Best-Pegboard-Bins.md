## Buyer's Guide

Pegboard bins are an excellent way to organize tools, parts, and small items in workshops, garages, and craft rooms. Understanding their features and considerations can help you choose the right storage solution for your space. 


### Material and Construction

Pegboard bins come in various materials like plastic, metal, and acrylic. Choose corrosion-resistant materials for outdoor use and opt for impact-resistant options for workshops where tools are frequently moved. The construction should be sturdy enough to hold your intended items without warping or bending. 

![Pegboard-Bins-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Pegboard-Bins-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Size and Depth

Standard bin sizes range from 3 to 8 inches tall, with depths between 3 and 6 inches. Consider the items you'll store to determine the appropriate size - smaller bins work well for loose parts, while deeper bins can hold longer tools or items. The height should allow for quick access without excessive bending. 


### Closure Options

Bins typically offer three closure types: snap-on lids, magnetic closures, and no lids. Snap-on lids are convenient for quick access but may allow dust entry. Magnetic closures keep items secure and clean but require proper material compatibility. Open bins provide the best visibility but need careful organization to prevent item scattering. 

![Pegboard-Bins-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Pegboard-Bins-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Mounting and Installation

Most pegboard bins mount using double-sided tape, clips, or screws. Proper mounting prevents wobbling and ensures long-term stability. Consider the weight of your stored items when choosing mounting options - heavier items need more secure mounting methods. 


## FAQ

![Pegboard-Bins-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Pegboard-Bins-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are pegboard bins?

Pegboard bins are storage containers specifically designed to fit into pegboard systems. They come in various sizes and materials to accommodate different types of items, from small tools and parts to larger accessories. 

The grated design of pegboard systems allows for easy visibility and quick access to stored items, making these bins particularly useful in workshop, garage, and organizational settings. 


### What materials are pegboard bins made from?

Multifamily units often combine materials, such as plastic-resin shells with metal bases, to balance cost, durability, and functionality.

### How do I properly measure for pegboard bins?

Measure the open space where you plan to install the bin, accounting for any existing support bars or decorative elements. Consider adding 1/8 inch to your measurements to ensure proper fit and alignment. 

Double-check measurements before purchasing to avoid returns or additional cutting costs. 


### What accessories should I consider with pegboard bins?

 shlids, channel locks, and quick-release clamps help secure bins to pegboards, preventing them from wobbling or falling during use. For larger or heavier items, consider additional mounting hardware or wall anchors. 

Organizer dividers, hooks, and shelf systems can maximize storage efficiency by separating contents and utilizing vertical space effectively.

### How do I clean and maintain pegboard bins?

Regular dusting with a microfiber cloth keeps bins clean and extends their lifespan. For deeper cleaning, use mild soap and water on plastic and rubber bins, while metal bins are best cleaned with a vinegar solution and steel wool for stubborn residue. 

Avoid abrasive cleaners and excessive force, which can damage the bin's surface or detach mounting accessories. 


### What should I consider when selecting pegboard bin sizes?

Measure the space twice to ensure you select the correct size that fits both horizontally and vertically. Consider the weight of items to be stored and choose bins with appropriate depth and height. 

Combining multiple smaller bins often provides more flexibility for organizing different items compared to larger, single-bin solutions.
