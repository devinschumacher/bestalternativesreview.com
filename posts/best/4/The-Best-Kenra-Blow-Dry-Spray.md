## Buyer's Guide

A Kenra Blow Dry Spray can transform an average hair style into salon-quality perfection, but with the right formula and application technique, you can achieve even more impressive results. This guide will help you understand the key features and considerations when selecting the perfect Kenra blow dry spray for your hair type and styling needs.

### Hydration vs. Control

Choose between hydration and control formulas based on your hair's needs. Hydrating sprays are ideal for dry or damaged hair types, providing both styling control and moisture. For oily or fine hair, a high-hold formula can help create volume and lift while managing natural oil production. 


### Application Technique

The way you apply the spray significantly impacts its effectiveness. Start by creating your desired hairstyle, then section your hair and spray the product onto each section before styling. For maximum hold, apply to the roots before blow-drying and to the ends after the style is set.

### Temperature Settings

Heat protection is crucial when using styling products with hot tools. Opt for a Kenra spray that includes thermal protection ingredients to shield your hair from damage caused by blow dryers and curling irons. Consider the distance setting on your blow dryer to minimize heat exposure while setting your style.

### Are there different formulas available?

Kenra offers multiple formulas of their blow dry spray, including a volume builder and a texture activator. The volume builder is ideal for fine hair types, while the texture activator is suitable for both fine and oily hair types. There's also a regular formula that balances volume and texture for all hair types. 

Each formula contains similar key ingredients but with slight variations in concentration and additives to target specific hair concerns. The volumizing formula, for example, contains stronger hold polymers to create more lift and separation. 


### Does Kenra Blow Dry Spray contain harsh chemicals?

However, it does contain alcohol, which can be drying for some hair types, especially curly or sensitive hair. If you have particularly dry or irritated scalp, consider applying a small amount of moisturizing scalp serum before using the blow dry spray.
