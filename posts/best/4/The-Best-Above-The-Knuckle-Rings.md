## Buyer's Guide

Above the knuckle rings have become increasingly popular for their distinctive style and versatility. These rings sit prominently on your finger, often featuring unique designs and playful proportions. When selecting an above the knuckle ring, consider several key factors to find a piece that matches your personal style and lifestyle. 


### Size and Fit

Proper sizing is crucial for an above the knuckle ring, as these pieces tend to be larger than traditional rings. The joint between the middle and ring fingers is a common measuring point. Consider whether you want the ring to sit snugly or have a bit more room for movement. Proper fit prevents wobbling and ensures the ring stays in place during daily activities. 


### Material and Finish

Materials range from classic metals like gold and silver to modern alternatives like titanium and stainless steel. Consider how the material feels against your skin and how it suits your lifestyle (e. g. , active, workplace, or casual environments). Finish options include polished, hammered, or distressed surfaces, each adding a unique visual element to the ring. 


### Design Elements

These rings often incorporate design elements that draw attention to the joint, such as prongs, bezels, or wraparound styles. Consider how the design complements your hand shape and finger size. Some popular design features include diamonds, colored gemstones, or intricate filigree patterns that add visual interest. 


### Wearability and Maintenance

Think about where you plan to wear the ring and how much exposure it will get to daily wear and tear. The ring's construction should be robust enough to withstand regular use. Consider maintenance requirements, such as cleaning frequency and whether the piece contains any elements that might require special care. 


## FAQ


### What is an above the knuckle ring?

These distinctive rings typically measure between 1.25 and 1.75 inches (32-44mm) in length, designed to sit just above the base of the thumb. Their unique placement makes them visible only when the hand is clenched into a fist.
