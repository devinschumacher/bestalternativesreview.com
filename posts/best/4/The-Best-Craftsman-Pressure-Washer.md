## Buyer's Guide

A craftsman pressure washer combines durability and performance for professional cleaning results. Understanding key features ensures you select the right model for your needs. 


### Power and Pressure

Rated in PSI (pounds per square inch), pressure determines the cleaning force. For tough jobs, 2,000-3,000 PSI is effective. GPM (gallons per minute) measures water flow. Higher GPM supports simultaneous cleaning and rinsing. 


### Motor and Construction

Electric models offer convenience, while gas-powered units provide greater mobility and power. Look for commercial-grade components like stainless steel parts and reinforced hoses for lasting performance. 


### Attachments and Accessories

Variety in nozzles allows targeting specific cleaning tasks. Fan tips distribute water for large surface coverage, while needle tips create powerful streams for detailed work. 


### Portability and Storage

Rubber handles and lightweight designs improve maneuverability. Telescoping handles enhance reach. When not in use, consider models with built-in storage for accessory kits. 


## FAQ


### What makes Craftsman pressure washers different from other brands?

Craftsman pressure washers stand out for their durable construction and reliable performance. Unlike some lighter-duty models, Craftsman units feature robust components that can handle both residential and commercial cleaning tasks. 

The brand also invests in user-friendly design elements, such as easy-to-understand controls and practical features like a hot water option for tougher jobs. 


### How much pressure do Craftsman pressure washers produce?

Craftsman pressure washers typically deliver between 1,200 to 2,000 pounds per square inch (psi) of cleaning power. This range provides enough pressure for most residential cleaning needs, from automobile washes to deck cleaning. 

Professional models in the lineup offer even higher pressures of up to 3,000 psi, suitable for commercial applications and deep cleaning of concrete and brick surfaces. 


### What maintenance do Craftsman pressure washers require?

Regular maintenance includes checking and replacing the engine air filter, maintaining proper hydraulic fluid levels in electric models, and cleaning or replacing the spray gun nozzle. The manufacturers recommend servicing the washer annually for optimal performance and longevity. 

The engine should be run for a few minutes each month to keep it in working condition, and the pump should be primed before each use to prevent damage to internal components. 


### Can Craftsman pressure washers handle different water temperature inputs?

Most Craftsman pressure washers are designed to accept both cold and hot water inputs, making them versatile for various cleaning applications. The combination of hot water helps sanitize surfaces and removes grease more effectively. 

However, users should note that using hot water can affect certain machine components over time, so regular maintenance is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the washer. 


### What features do Craftsman pressure washers offer for convenience?

Convenience features include adjustable spray patterns for targeted cleaning, ergonomic handles for easy maneuvering, and telescoping wands that extend cleaning reach without the hassle of extension cords. 

Many models also feature electric start engines with keyless ignition and digital controls, making operation straightforward and intuitive for users of all experience levels. 


### How long do Craftsman pressure washers last?

With proper maintenance and regular use, Craftsman pressure washers can last between 5 to 10 years, depending on the model and frequency of use. Professional-grade models, which receive more usage, often last closer to the upper end of this range. 

Users should replace worn parts at the manufacturer's recommended intervals to extend the life of their pressure washer and maintain optimal performance. 


### What should I consider when choosing a Craftsman pressure washer?

Key considerations include the maximum pressure and flow rate needed for your cleaning tasks, the weight of the unit if manual mobility is required, and whether you need hot water capabilities. Consider also the sound level, especially if operating in residential areas. 

The size and weight of the machine are important factors in determining ease of storage and transport. Evaluate the length of the electrical cable if power cord operation is necessary for your intended usage.
