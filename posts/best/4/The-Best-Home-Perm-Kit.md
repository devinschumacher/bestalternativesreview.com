## Buyer's Guide

A home perm kit transforms straight hair into beautifully curved locks with professional results. These kits contain essential chemicals and tools for permanent waving. When choosing a home perm kit, consider the type of perm solution, heat requirements, and included accessories. 


### Perming Solution Type

Home perm kits come in two main solution types: thioglycolic acid (TGA) and ammonium thioglycolate (ATG). TGA solutions are stronger and work faster, while ATG is gentler and safer for damaged hair. Consider your hair type and damage level when selecting a solution type.

These kits vary in whether they require heat application. No-heat perm kits use plastic rods and towels, while heat-activated kits use rods with aluminum caps that need to be heated for activation. Consider your styling routine and equipment availability when choosing a kit type. 


### Included Accessories

Home perm kits typically include various-sized curling rods, aluminum caps, gloves, and protective covers. Some advanced kits feature temperature-controlled rods, digital timers, and specialized tools for different hair types. Evaluate which accessories best match your styling needs and hair type.

Avoid frequent washing and use products specifically designed for curly or perm hair to maintain your style. 

Regularly reapply curl-defining products and consider using a curling wand or diffuser attachment for stubborn areas.
