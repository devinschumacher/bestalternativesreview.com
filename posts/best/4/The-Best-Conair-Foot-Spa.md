This pedicure spa lets you ease your feet into a warm soak while tiny rollers give your soles a gentle massage. You can angle the vibrations for a stronger or softer feel, perfect for tired feet at the end of the day. The built-in bubble system adds a relaxing bubble massage right at your toes. While it doesn't heat water like some spas, it keeps a decent temperature if you start with hot water, and the deep basin lets your ankles submerge too.

This cozy Conair foot spa combines soothing bubbles with warm paraffin treatment for a relaxing hands-and-feet care session. While it takes about an hour to heat up the paraffin wax, the foot rest provides gentle massage as you wait.

### Do these foot spas require maintenance?
