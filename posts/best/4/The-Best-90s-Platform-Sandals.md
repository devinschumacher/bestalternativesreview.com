These chunky platform wedges harken back to the 90s with their towering 3-inch heels and fabric-strapped design. While some reviewers praise their lightweight construction and nostalgic appeal, others find the high platform and flimsy upper materials make them difficult to walk in and prone to tight fits, particularly around the toe area. The platform's heft and the unexpected breakage reported by some users suggest these wedge sandals may not be the most practical choice for everyday wear. 


## Buyer's Guide

90s platform sandals have made a massive comeback, combining retro charm with modern comfort. These stackable wonders add serious height while keeping feet surprisingly stable. But with so many options out there, how do you pick the right pair? 


### Cushioning and Comfort Features

The best 90s platform sandals strike a perfect balance between height and comfort. Look for orthopedic insoles, padded straps, and flexible materials that support your arches and absorb impact. Heavier platforms might be more stable, but check the weight-to-height ratio to ensure they're practical for your style.

### Stability and Grip

Sandals designed specifically for high platforms typically incorporate features that enhance stability. Wide bases, dual straps, and slightly curved soles provide better footing than generic styles. If you have wide feet, consider models with adjustable straps or extra-wide designs to prevent wobbling during wear. 


### Sandal Build Quality and Durability

Premium materials like genuine leather or synthetic leather reinforcements usually indicate better durability. The upper layers should feel sturdy without being overly rigid. Check the stitching quality and strap construction; strong, consistent stitching prevents wear points and keeps the sandal together during daily use.

### Care and Maintenance Requirements

Platform sandals can be more demanding to maintain than their flat counterparts. The soles, especially on high models, require regular cleaning and conditioning to prevent scuffs and damage. Choose sandals with removable insoles for easier care, and consider water-resistant materials if you plan to wear them in various environments.

### What makes 90s platform sandals unique?

90s platform sandals are characterized by their height, which typically ranges from 2 to 4 inches, providing instant elevation while walking. Unlike modern platforms, these vintage styles often feature chunky block heels or stacked soles that add both height and retro flair. 

Their design elements include detailed craftsmanship with elements like intricate straps, embellishments, and wide footbeds that offer stability. Common materials range from leather and fabric to plastic and wood, each adding distinct texture and visual interest. 


### What styles were popular in the 90s?

Retro platforms included gladiator sandals with open-toe designs and multiple leather straps, Mary Janes with rounded toes and ankle straps, and flip-flops with stacked soles. Colorways ranged from bold primary colors to pastels and metallic finishes, often featuring prints like animal patterns or graphic designs. 

These sandals combined athletic influence with fashion-forward elements like velcro straps, adjustable buckles, and oversized medallions. The styles catered to various occasions, from casual daytime wear to formal events with their versatile design options.

### How do I choose the right size?

Platform sandals can run small due to their height and heel design. Start by measuring your standard shoe size and add half a size for platforms. Consider trying them on with the same socks or pantyhose you'll wear with them, as these can affect fit. 

Check for wiggle room in the toe box - your longest toe should have about a half-inch of space. The ankle strap should hold the heel firmly in place when you step, but the heel itself shouldn't be too tight or constricting. 


### What should I consider for comfort?

The primary factors for comfort are the sole material and the footbed design. Look for platforms with natural rubber or EVA soles that provide both grip and shock absorption. The footbed should have some cushioning, either through built-in arch support or additional insole options. 

Wide straps and padded ankles help distribute pressure, while adjustable straps allow for better fit customization. If you have arch pain or discomfort, consider platforms with removable insoles that can be replaced with orthotic options.

### What maintenance requirements do I need to consider?

Platform sandals require regular cleaning to maintain their appearance, particularly if they're made of leather or fabric. Use a soft cloth and mild soap or a specialized polish for leather. The height and style can make them more prone to scuffs and mud stains, so carrying a small travel bag for protection is advisable. 

Store your platforms properly to prevent damage. Avoid stacking them directly on each other, as this can cause indentations and misalignments. Keep them in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight to prevent fading and cracking. 


### How should I break them in?

Wear your new platforms around the house or on short trips before committing to daily wear. Start with casual activities like walking around the neighborhood or doing errands to allow your feet to adjust. Pay attention to any areas of pressure or discomfort and consider wearing softer socks during this period. 

If you experience any pain or redness, take a break and return to wearing your regular footwear for a day or two. Gradually increase your wear time and vary your activities to help your feet get used to the new height and style.
