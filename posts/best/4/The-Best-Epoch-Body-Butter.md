### Key Ingredients

Look for butters like shea and cocoa, vitamins A and E, and natural oils such as coconut and jojoba. These ingredients help lock in moisture, repair damaged skin, and enhance skin elasticity. 


### Texture and Spreadability

Choose a consistency that matches your needs. Rich, thicker butters offer deep hydration but can feel heavy on sensitive skin. Lighter options are more absorbent and ideal for daily use. 


### Scent and Coloring

Consider natural scents from essential oils or unscented varieties for those sensitive to fragrances. Natural color comes from ingredients like cocoa powder or matcha, while clear butters offer no coloration. 


### Storage and Shelf Life

Store butters in a cool, dry place to maintain their quality. Most have a shelf life of 6-12 months when properly stored. Signs of spoilage include rancid odors, changes in texture, or the presence of mold. 


## FAQ


### What makes Epoch Body Butter different from other moisturizers?

Epoch Body Butter delivers intense hydration through its rich blend of organic shea butter, jojoba oil, and vitamin E. Unlike traditional lotions that wash away quickly, this body butter forms a protective barrier on the skin, locking in moisture for 24 hours. 

Its heavyweight formula feels luxurious but is actually ultra-absorbent, making it perfect for dry skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis. Unlike greasy alternatives, Epoch Body Butter absorbs quickly without leaving a residue. 


### Can I use Epoch Body Butter on my face?

Yes, Epoch Body Butter can be used on your face as a deeper moisturizer for dry patches and eczema-prone areas. However, it's thicker than conventional facial moisturizers, so you may find it more suitable for targeted application rather than daily all-over use. 

The brand recommends applying it once or twice weekly as a mask or spot treatment for intense hydration. 


### What if I have sensitive skin?

Epoch Body Butter is hypoallergenic and contains no harsh chemicals, making it suitable for most sensitive skin types. It's free from parabens, sulfates, and synthetic fragrances that can irritate skin. 

Before regular use, perform a patch test on a small area of skin to ensure no adverse reaction occurs. 


### How long does a jar last?

Each 13.2oz jar of Epoch Body Butter lasts approximately 2 months when using it on dry patches twice weekly, or 4 months as a daily moisturizer for normal skin. 

The rich formula means you won't need to use it as frequently as lighter lotions, providing excellent value for money. 


### Is it suitable for all skin types?

While formulated for dry skin, Epoch Body Butter can be beneficial for all skin types. Its nourishing properties help maintain skin elasticity and prevent dryness, making it suitable for normal to oily skin types when used in moderation. 

Avoid using it excessively on very oily or acne-prone areas unless specifically recommended by a dermatologist. 


### When should I apply it for best results?

Apply Epoch Body Butter immediately after showering while your skin is still slightly damp to lock in natural moisture. 

For best results, use it at night before bed to give your skin a full 8 hours of hydration, or after intense physical activity to replenish lost moisture.
