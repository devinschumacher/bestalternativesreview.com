## Buyer's Guide

Black hair extensions can dramatically enhance your natural hair, whether you're extending your length, adding volume, or changing your hair color. When selecting extensions, consider several key factors to ensure a natural-looking result and durable style. 


### Natural vs. Synthetic

Synthetic extensions offer a budget-friendly option with various styles and lengths. They resist tangling and shedding but may not match your natural hair color perfectly. Natural fiber extensions, like Remy human hair, provide a more realistic appearance with less maintenance. They cost more initially but last longer with proper care. 


### Color Options and Matching

When selecting black extensions, consider your skin tone and existing hair color. Cool tones pair best with black extensions, while warm tones may look unnatural. If your natural hair color is dark brown, pre-lighten your hair before dyeing extensions for a more blendable base. 

Professional matching services can help achieve the perfect shade, but be aware that no color matches perfectly for every individual. Trust experienced stylists to guide you through the selection process. 


### Hair Quality and Maintenance

Investing in high-quality extensions made from Remy or Tangle Teezer quality hair ensures easier maintenance and longer-lasting results. Look for extensions with full cuticles, which reduce tangling and frizz. 

Maintenance includes regular deep conditioning, weekly washing with sulfate-free shampoo, and proper brushing with a wide-tooth comb. Professional touch-ups every 6-8 weeks help maintain length and prevent split ends. 


### Application Options

Extension methods range from clip-ins for quick styling tobonding for a more permanent look. Clips offer the most versatility but require frequent reapplication. Bonding provides a natural appearance but demands more maintenance and can be more challenging to remove. 

Consider your lifestyle and desired maintenance level when choosing an application method. Some people find extensions most practical with a consultation from a professional stylist. 


## FAQ
