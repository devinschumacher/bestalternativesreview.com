## FAQ


### What's the difference between the Ninja Toaster Oven and a conventional toaster oven?

Unlike traditional toaster ovens, which primarily focus on baking and toasting, the Ninja model offers advanced cooking features like convection technology and air fry modes. This allows for more versatile cooking options, including crispier fries and perfectly baked chicken. 

The primary differences lie in performance and capabilities. While basic toaster ovens excel at straightforward baking and reheating, the Ninja model delivers professional-level results with its enhanced cooking techniques and larger capacity. 


### How does the air fry mode work, and what types of foods can I cook?

The air fry mode uses a combination of hot air circulation and precise temperature control to sear food while keeping it light and crispy. It's particularly effective for cooking chicken wings, french fries, and vegetables, giving you the texture of an oil-fried dish with far less fat. 

For best results, use the included air fry basket and follow the recommended cooking times. While versatile, this mode works best with small to medium-sized pieces of food that can be evenly exposed to the air flow. 


### What's the capacity of the Ninja Toaster Oven?

The standard model has a generous 1.75 cubic foot capacity, which is suitable for baking a full sheet of cookies or roasting a whole chicken. The larger model increases this to 2.25 cubic feet, allowing for even more versatile cooking options. 

Both models feature a large glass door that provides excellent visibility into your cooking process without losing heat. The interior shelf and crumb tray make it easy to accommodate various recipe requirements. 


### How does the convection mode improve cooking?

Convection cooking uses a fan and precise temperature control to circulate hot air throughout the oven, resulting in more even heating and shorter cooking times. This mode is particularly effective for baking, roasting, and drying foods. 

When using convection, reduce standard recipe times by 25% and lower the temperature by 25°F. This feature works best with recipes that call for longer cooking times and even heat distribution. 


### What maintenance is required for the Ninja Toaster Oven?

Regular maintenance includes wiping down the exterior with a damp cloth and cleaning the interior with warm water and mild soap after each use. The glass door and interior elements are dishwasher-safe for added convenience. 

Check the filter monthly and clean it as needed to maintain optimal airflow. The crumb tray should be emptied after every use to prevent odors and ensure proper oven performance. 


### How long does it take to preheat the oven?

Preheating times vary by setting, but most programs reach optimal temperatures within 5-10 minutes. The convection setting typically takes longer to heat up compared to standard baking modes. 

For the best results, allow sufficient time for preheating before adding ingredients. This ensures consistent cooking temperatures and prevents hot spots in your food.
