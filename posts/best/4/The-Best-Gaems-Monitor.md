## Buyer's Guide

A gaming monitor enhances your gaming experience with its visuals, responsiveness, and features tailored for gamers. Understanding key specifications helps you choose a monitor that matches your gaming needs and setup. 


### Display Resolution

Resolution determines image clarity, with higher numbers representing sharper details. Common resolutions include 1080p (Full HD), 1440p (QHD), and 4K Ultra HD. Consider your graphics card capabilities and screen size to find the right balance of detail and performance.

### Refresh Rate

Refresh rate measures how often the screen updates its image per second, measured in Hertz (Hz). For gaming, a minimum of 120Hz is recommended, while 144Hz and higher provide smoother motion and faster response times, especially for competitive gaming and HDR content. 


### Response Time

Response time indicates how quickly a monitor changes from one color to another, measured in milliseconds (ms). Lower response times reduce motion blur and input lag, which is crucial for competitive gaming. Professional gamers typically prefer monitors with response times under 5ms.

### Input Lag

Input lag measures the delay between your controller input and on-screen action, affecting gaming responsiveness. Competitive gamers should aim for monitors with input lag below 20ms. Modern gaming monitors often offer low input lag through technologies like AMD FreeSync or NVIDIA G-Sync compatibility.
