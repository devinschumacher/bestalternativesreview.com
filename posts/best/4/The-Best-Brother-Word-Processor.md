## Buyer's Guide

When selecting a Brother word processor, several key features and considerations will help you find the right model for your needs. Understanding these aspects ensures you choose a device that matches your workflow, prints quality documents, and offers the functionality you require. 


### Print Quality and Speed

Print resolution determines document clarity, with 600 dpi being standard for office use. Consider whether you need photo-quality printing or sufficient detail for text documents. Processing speed affects how quickly you can print multiple pages or large files, important for managing documents in busy environments. 


### Memory and Connectivity

Memory capacity impacts how quickly your word processor can handle complex documents and macros. Most modern models offer 128 MB to 256 MB, which should suffice for standard office use. Connectivity options like USB 2.0, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth expand your device's capabilities, allowing for easy file transfers and remote printing. 


### Software and Features

Build-in word processing software should support common functions like document formatting, spell checking, and basic editing tools. Consider additional features such as equation editor for mathematical documents, scripting capabilities for advanced users, and compatibility with other office applications. 


### Build Quality and Size

Brother word processors vary in size from compact desktop models to larger floor-standing units. Smaller models offer better desk integration but may have reduced features. Build quality affects reliability; look for durable construction materials and sturdy mechanisms. Size considerations also impact the available workspace around the device. 


## FAQ


### What is a Brother word processor?

These processors are designed for both professional and home use, offering features like spell check, grammar suggestions, and document formatting options. 


### What makes the Brother line unique?

Brother word processors are recognized for their durability and reliability. They often include built-in thermal paper feeders and advanced typing assist features. 

Recent models incorporate Bluetooth connectivity, allowing users to transfer text to smartphones or tablets for further editing or printing. 


### What are the main models?

Brother offers several series, including the WP-5000 and WP-6000, each with increasing features and capabilities. The WP-6000 series typically includes more advanced functions and connectivity options.
