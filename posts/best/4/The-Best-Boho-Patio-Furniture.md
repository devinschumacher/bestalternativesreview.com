## FAQ


### What is boho patio furniture?

### What types of materials are commonly used in boho patio furniture?

Boho furniture often features natural materials like rattan, jute, and cotton, which can withstand outdoor conditions while maintaining an organic feel. High-quality wood, such as teak and acacia, is also popular for its durability and weather resistance. 

Metal elements, particularly wrought iron, are frequently used to add structure and support to boho pieces. These metals can be finished with weatherproof coatings to prevent rust and maintain their appearance. 


### How should I maintain boho patio furniture?

Regular maintenance is essential to preserve the natural look and durability of boho patio furniture. Use a soft brush to remove dust and debris, followed by a mild soap and water solution.
