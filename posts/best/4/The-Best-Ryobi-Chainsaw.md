## Buyer's Guide

A Ryobi chainsaw combines powerful performance with the convenience of interchangeable batteries, making it a versatile choice for both beginners and experienced users. These saws use standard G5 batteries, allowing you to power multiple tools and maintain consistent cutting ability throughout your day. 


### Engine Specifications

Look for a chainsaw with a powerful engine suitable for your cutting needs. Ryobi offers both two-stroke and four-stroke engine options, with displacement sizes ranging from 20 to 36 cc. Two-stroke engines are more compact and provide quick acceleration, ideal for pruning and general cutting, while four-stroke engines offer smoother operation and longer component life for heavier-duty use. 


### Bar and Chain specifications

The bar and chain determine the saw's cutting capacity and are available in various lengths and gauges. Common bar lengths range from 16 to 20 inches, with wider bars (20-24 inches) suitable for cutting larger diameter wood. Chain specifications include pitch (3/8, 1/4, or 5/32 inch) and gauge, with heavier gauges (060, 080) more resistant to wear for tough cutting conditions. 


### Battery Considerations

Power your saw with G5 batteries that provide 2.0 Ah or 3.0 Ah capacity for extended runtime. The battery's voltage (12V for 2.0 Ah, 18V for 3.0 Ah) affects both cutting power and runtime. Consider a battery pack that suits your daily usage - multiple 2.0 Ah batteries allow quick swap capabilities for continuous cutting, while a single 3.0 Ah battery offers longer runtime for longer jobs. 


### Additional Features

Key features to consider include chain stop, bar deflector, and chain catcher for safety. The chain stop instantly prevents chain movement when the chain brake activates, while the bar deflector prevents chain wrap when pulling the chain. A chain catcher helps prevent kicked-back chains and should be standard on your saw.
