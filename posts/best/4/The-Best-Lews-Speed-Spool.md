A Lews Speed Spool is a specialized rod component that significantly enhances casting distance and accuracy. Understanding its features and proper use will help you choose the right setup for your fishing needs. 


### Core Features

A Lews Speed Spool features a large-diameter core with a double-gate design that allows for faster line retrieval compared to traditional spools. The larger core diameter reduces line twist, while the double-gate system enables quick changes between casting and retrieve modes. 


### Floating Core Technology

The floating core design rises to the surface when the spool is not in use, reducing water resistance and rotational drag. This technology helps maintain line speed during the cast and improves overall casting performance. 


### Line Capacity and Retrieval Rate

When selecting a Lews Speed Spool, consider the recommended line capacity for your rod and the casting distances you typically achieve. The spool's retrieval rate, measured in feet per second, should match your preferred retrieve speed to optimize performance. 


### Maintenance and Storage

To maximize performance, regularly clean and lubricate the spool mechanism. Store the rod properly to prevent damage to the spool's floating core and double-gate system. Avoid exposing the rod to extreme temperatures, which can affect the spool's operational integrity. 


## FAQ


### What makes Lews Speed Spools unique?

Lews Speed Spools combine lightweight aluminum construction with precision engineering to deliver exceptional casting performance. Their speed-enhancing features include a narrow centerline design, reduced drag systems, and optimized spool shapes for faster line speed and farther casts. 

The speed advantage comes from their ability to minimize line twist and increase casting distance, making them particularly effective for species like bass, panfish, and trout where quick presentations are crucial. 


### How do Lews Speed Spools compare to conventional spools?

These specialized spools offer superior casting performance due to their aerodynamic shapes and reduced surface area, allowing for up to 10% longer casts compared to standard spools of similar size. 

However, they are not designed for every fishing scenario. The reduced diameter also means less line capacity, so users should choose appropriate line weight and type based on their specific fishing needs. 


### What are the main benefits of Lews Speed Spools?

The primary benefits are increased casting distance and reduced line tangle, thanks to their aerodynamic design and optimized spool shape. This makes them particularly effective in windy conditions or when precise long-range casts are needed. 

They are also lighter than traditional spools, reducing tiredness during long fishing sessions without sacrificing performance. 


### Who should consider using Lews Speed Spools?

Anglers who prioritize casting distance and accuracy, especially in windy conditions or when targeting hard-to-reach spots. They are ideal for species like bass, panfish, and trout where quick presentations are crucial. 

However, they may not be suitable for heavy-duty applications or situations requiring maximum line capacity. 


### What should I consider when choosing a Lews Speed Spool?

When selecting a Lews Speed Spool, consider the diameter and weight rating to match your rod's specifications. The line capacity should match your intended use, whether for finesse presentations or power casts. 

Check compatibility with your reel model and ensure you have the proper accessories, such as appropriate clickpads or line stop mechanisms. 


### How do Lews Speed Spools perform in different weather conditions?

In favorable winds, Lews Speed Spools excel by reducing line twist and maintaining smooth, consistent casts. However, very strong crosswinds can still affect casting accuracy and distance. 

They perform exceptionally well in calm conditions, particularly on stillwater fisheries where precise long-range casts are needed.
