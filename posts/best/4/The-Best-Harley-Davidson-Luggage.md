## Buyer's Guide

Harley Davidson luggage combines style, functionality, and brand heritage to create distinctive motorcycle carrying solutions. Understanding the key aspects of motorcycle luggage helps you select a system that matches your riding needs, preferences, and motorcycle specifications. 


### Luggage Compatibility and Fit

Harley Davidson luggage systems include various types of bags and boxes. Consider your bike's specific configuration, including fairings, panniers, and backrests, to determine compatible storage options. The system's mounting points should align with your bike's designs for secure, proper fit. 

Check the system's maximum load capacity to match your storage needs, ensuring it fits within your motorcycle's weight rating for overall stability and safety. 


### Waterproofing and Weather Protection

Harley Davidson luggage often features water-resistant or fully waterproof designs, crucial for protecting valuable items during inclement weather. Look for specific ratings or certification for durability against rain, snow, and moisture. 

Some systems include thermal insulation features to maintain the temperature of contents like food or beverages, though these typically add to the luggage's bulk and weight. 


### Security and Locking Features

Harley Davidson luggage frequently integrates high-security lock mechanisms to protect your contents. Look for durable, concealed locks with multiple-point security systems against unauthorized access. 

Consider luggage with secondary locking points or theft-deterrent designs like those featuring asymmetrical shapes that prevent easy removal. 


### Ergonomics and Access Convenience

Proper ergonomics enhance both loading and unloading convenience. Look for luggage systems with intuitive mounting points that allow quick access to contents while maintaining proper bike balance. 

Storage systems with multi-compartment designs or internal organizers help keep contents sorted and accessible, though these features may reduce maximum capacity. 


## FAQ


### What materials are Harley Davidson luggage cases made from?

Harley Davidson luggage features durable, water-resistant materials including high-density foam cores, reinforced stitching, and heavy-duty zippers. Their cases are primarily constructed from polycarbonate, ABS plastic, and nylon, providing protection while maintaining light weight. 

For premium options, they offer leather-faced aluminum cases that combine traditional leather craftsmanship with modern aluminum construction for added durability and weather resistance. 


### Can Harley Davidson luggage be customized?

Harley Davidson offers customization options through their Leather Kit program, allowing owners to replace or upgrade the leather trim on their cases. This includes updating handles, straps, and other leather elements to match personal preferences or motorcycle upgrades. 

Additionally, some third-party accessories can be added for custom functionality, such as additional pockets, dividers, or locking mechanisms, though these may not be officially branded Harley Davidson products. 


### What size options are available for Harley Davidson luggage?

Harley Davidson luggage comes in several size options to match their touring bikes. Standard cases typically range from 32-39 inches long and 12-14 inches deep. Larger options, often called "touring" cases, measure around 48 inches long and 16 inches deep, providing more capacity for longer trips. 

Customization options like tailcone adaptors, rear mounts, and pannier brackets allow owners to adjust the positioning and size of their luggage based on their specific motorcycle and riding style. 


### How much weight can Harley Davidson luggage cases hold?

The weight capacity of Harley Davidson cases varies by model, with most standard cases rated for 15-25 lbs (6.8-11.3 kg). Premium options and touring cases often have higher weight capacities, ranging from 25-35 lbs (11.3-15.9 kg) or more, depending on the specific design and materials. 

It's important to note that while these weight ratings are based on professional testing, factors like environmental conditions (heat, moisture) and how items are packed can affect actual capacity and load stability. 


### What is the average durability rating for Harley Davidson luggage?

Harley Davidson luggage typically receives high durability ratings from independent reviews and customer feedback, often ranking in the top tier for touring motorcycle luggage. Most cases come with a warranty period of 1-2 years, indicating manufacturer confidence in their product's longevity. 

Independent test results show that their cases maintain structural integrity and waterproofing properties even after extended use, including frequent temperature cycling and exposure to road salt and debris. 


### What maintenance requirements do Harley Davidson luggage cases have?

Basic maintenance for Harley Davidson luggage includes regular cleaning with mild soap and water, drying thoroughly to prevent moisture damage, and checking zip mechanisms and hardware for proper function. For leather-faced cases, occasional conditioning of the leather surfaces helps maintain its appearance and durability. 

Storage should be in a dry environment when not in use, and protective covers are recommended for long-term storage to prevent dust accumulation and protect the finish.
