## FAQ


### What is a bike GPS tracker?

A bike GPS tracker is a device or app that uses satellite technology to track the location, speed, and route of a bicycle in real-time. These tools help cyclists stay safe, monitor their rides, and share their adventures with others. 

Most bike GPS trackers are compact, waterproof, and mountable on bikes. They sync with smartphone apps that display detailed ride data such as distance traveled, elevation changes, and average speed.

The actual accuracy depends on factors like satellite visibility, interference from buildings or trees, and the specific technology used in the tracker. 


### What features should I look for in a bike GPS tracker?

Key features include battery life (at least 6 hours per charge), water resistance (IPX7 rating recommended), and storage capacity for offline maps. Optional features might include heart rate monitoring, voice assistant compatibility, or social sharing capabilities.
