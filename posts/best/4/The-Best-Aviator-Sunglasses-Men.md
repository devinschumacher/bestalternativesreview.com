While the metal frame and scratch-resistant coating are top-notch, the real star here is the massive 150mm arm length, specifically designed to sit comfortably on wider faces. The polarized lenses really excel in bright light conditions, making these a practical choice for everyday wear. The slightly larger-than-average 65mm lens width adds a touch of vintage flair to the classic aviator silhouette.

The Quay Australia High Key sunglasses combine stylish aviator design with polarized lenses that block 100% of harmful UV rays. Coming in a sleek black/fade color, these durable plastic sunglasses are built to last – but be prepared for a learning curve when it comes to sizing, as the brand frequently changes their sizing terminology without updating their website.

These lightweight plastic aviators offer a comfortable fit with their 17mm bridge, though some reviewers noted that the frames feel a bit thin for the price point.

### [Ray Ban RB3026 Aviator Large Metal Sunglasses](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Aviator+Sunglasses+Men?utm\_term=ray-ban-rb3026-aviator-large-metal-sunglasses)

![Ray Ban RB3026 Aviator Large Metal Sunglasses | Image](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcQt88Uwx4xZzJ2aI5SwYXRY6XGxwCWdhmhcgQf-aZsqlxe47Wh9&usqp=CAY)

### [Timberland Men's Advanced Aviator Sunglasses](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Aviator+Sunglasses+Men?utm\_term=timberland-mens-advanced-aviator-sunglasses)

![Timberland Men's Advanced Aviator Sunglasses | Image](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcTroK\_yjvBNwEUebp15KidZGNSTxFwsSNaqcDHhFbTCi0QK5y4rwFt6buKa7tjFQ\_vsCvlOZJCu1\_spBoeRpZWBGnIvR-HJ&usqp=CAY)

Timberland's men's aviator sunglasses might look the part with their classic shape and included pouch case, but we have to say their polarized lenses and decent 63mm eye measurements fall a bit short given the disappointing quality of the plastic frame. The 1-star rating from the one reviewer who took the time to comment suggests these might be better suited to style-conscious shoppers looking for something under $20 rather than serious sunwear enthusiasts. 


### [Quay Backstage Pass 52mm Aviator Sunglasses](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Aviator+Sunglasses+Men?utm\_term=quay-backstage-pass-52mm-aviator-sunglasses)

These Quay aviators blend sleek design with practical UV protection, though some find the lack of side coverage and generous 52mm lens size might not suit everyone's face shape. The metal frames feel solid and stylish, with adjustable nosepads that should provide a good fit once you get them adjusted just right. They've earned mixed reviews for their build quality, with some praising their lightweight comfort and modern look while others report issues like loose screws after just a few days of use. 


### [Ray-Ban RB4184 Polarized Sunglasses](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Aviator+Sunglasses+Men?utm\_term=ray-ban-rb4184-polarized-sunglasses)

When you think Phoenix, you think big, bold, and unapologetically stylish—and that's exactly what these oversized aviators deliver. With their distinctive double bridge and polarized lenses that block 100% of UV rays, they've got both fashion and function covered. Choose from classic black frames or go for something more daring like peach tortoise or mirror pink.

Made for big faces, these metal-framed sunglasses have a retro pilot style with mirrored lenses. While they're awesome for guys with larger heads, they might be too roomy for just about anyone else. The polycarbonate lenses do a good job blocking UV rays, but the price doesn't quite match the quality. 


### [Ray-Ban RB4165 Justin Sunglasses](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Aviator+Sunglasses+Men?utm\_term=ray-ban-rb4165-justin-sunglasses)

These Ray-Ban aviator sunglasses have become a classic for a reason. The metal frame, while lightweight, gives them a sturdy feel that stands up to regular wear.

## Buyer's Guide

Aviator sunglasses combine classic style with practical UV protection, making them a popular choice for men. When selecting the right pair, consider several key factors to ensure you find both style and performance that suit your needs. 


### Frame Materials

Common materials include metal, nylon, and acetate. Metal frames offer durability and a vintage look, while nylon provides lightweight comfort suitable for active lifestyles. Acetate frames blend flexibility with sophisticated styling options. 


### Lens Options

Standard amber lenses enhance contrast and visibility in sunny conditions, while polarized lenses reduce glare from reflective surfaces like water. For transitional or indoor/outdoor use, photochromic lenses automatically adjust their shade based on light levels. 


### Size and Fit

Opt for frames that sit comfortably on your face without slipping. The width should accommodate your ears while allowing adequate ventilation. The bridge should rest flat across the nose with minimal pressure. 


### Care and Maintenance

Regular cleaning with a microfiber cloth prevents scratches and maintains clarity. For deeper cleaning, use mild soap and warm water. Store your sunglasses in a protective case to prevent damage from moisture and UV exposure. 


## FAQ


### What makes aviator sunglasses distinct?

Classic aviator sunglasses feature a distinctive teardrop-shaped lens with a wraparound design. The frames typically bow outward slightly, following the curvature of the face while maintaining a sleek profile. 

These sunglasses derive their name from military aviators' goggles, incorporating similar wraparound protection while transitioning to civilian wear. The characteristic style has remained popular for over 70 years. 


### How do aviator frames compare to other styles?

Unlike oval or square frames, aviators' curved shape offers superior face framing, particularly on longer faces. The distinctive shape draws attention to the eyes, making this style particularly effective for most face shapes. 

While broader frames complement round faces, aviators work well on all face shapes due to their classic proportions. They're less aggressive than some contemporary styles while offering more visual interest than minimalist alternatives. 


### Which lens colors suit aviator frames?

Classic aviators feature brown or gray lenses, complementing their heritage design. These neutral tones protect eyes while maintaining natural color balance, ideal for everyday wear. 

For specific situations, amber gives clearer vision in hazy conditions, while green enhances contrast in bright sunlight. Blue or green mirrored lenses add a stylish touch for evening wear or formal occasions. 


### What factors influence aviator size selection?

Frame width typically ranges from 41mm to 50mm, with broader frames suitable for longer faces. The optimal size balances frame visibility with comfort, requiring only slight visual overlap at the bridge. 

 Lens height usually spans 45mm to 55mm. Smaller frames work well with shorter noses, while longer faces may benefit from slightly taller frames for better visual balance. 


### How should I clean my aviator sunglasses?

Use a soft microfiber cloth for daily cleaning, avoiding harsh chemicals or abrasive materials that could scratch the lenses or frame. For deeper cleaning, mix mild soap with water and gently wipe down the lenses and frame. 

. Store your sunglasses in their case when not in use, protecting them from scratches and UV damage. Avoid leaving them in direct sunlight or extreme temperatures, which can affect both the lenses and frame integrity. 


### What maintenance helps extend aviator lifespan?

Regularly inspect lenses and frames for signs of wear, replacing lenses when scratches or optical distortion become noticeable. Professional cleaning twice yearly can help maintain optimal clarity and prevent buildup. 

Store sunglasses in their case with soft inserts to prevent scratches during transport. Avoid using paper towels or napkins for cleaning, as the texture can damage the protective coatings on modern lenses.
