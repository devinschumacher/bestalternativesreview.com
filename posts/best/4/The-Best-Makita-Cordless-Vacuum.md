## Buyer's Guide

Makita cordless vacuums combine powerful cleaning with the convenience of battery operation, making them suitable for both home and professional use. These versatile machines offer multiple benefits, including reduced cord constraints and extended reach capabilities, but selecting the right model requires consideration of several key factors. 


### Power and Performance

Makita vacuums deliver impressive suction through high-voltage motor technology and efficient motor designs. Power consumption is balanced with runtime through advanced battery management systems. For debris collection, look for vacuums with dust-tight seals and adequate filtration systems to maintain suction over time. 


### Size and Portability

Makita offers cordless vacuums in various sizes, from compact models for narrow spaces to larger machines with longer reach. Consider the vacuum's weight distribution, as some models may feel cumbersome during extended use. The handle design should provide a secure grip while minimizing fatigue during operation. 


### Battery and Charging

The vacuum's battery performance significantly impacts its usability. Look for models with Ni-Cad or NiMH batteries, which offer high energy density and good charge retention. The charging system should provide fast charging capabilities and status indicators to monitor battery level. Consider the vacuum's runtime for your specific cleaning needs.

## FAQ


### What makes Makita cordless vacuums different from other brands?

Makita's cordless vacuums stand out through their powerful lithium-ion batteries and efficient motor technology, providing both runtime and suction power that many competitors struggle to match at similar price points. The company also excels in build quality, with durable casings and robust attachments that enhance versatility. 

Makita has developed its own battery system, the EnSmart technology, which enables quick charging, accurate power monitoring, and battery health tracking through the official app. This system helps owners optimize their battery performance and plan maintenance schedules. 


### How long does a Makita cordless vacuum battery last?

A standard Makita 60V battery lasts between 45-60 minutes on a single charge, depending on the model and attachments used. This runtime is sufficient for most home cleaning tasks, including vacuuming rooms and stairs. 

Users can extend their cleaning time by purchasing additional batteries and charging them while one is in use. The official app shows battery status and remaining runtime, helping users plan their cleaning sessions efficiently. 


### What attachments come with a Makita cordless vacuum?

Most Makita cordless vacuums come with basic attachments including a motorized brush, crevice tool, and dusting brush. These allow cleaning of hard-to-reach areas and specialized tasks like pet hair removal and dusting. 

Additional attachments can be purchased separately, such as a floor tool for carpeted areas, motorized brush for pet hair, and upholstery tool for cleaning furniture. Many models also feature interchangeable motorized attachments that work with different heads. 


### How do I properly maintain a Makita cordless vacuum?

Regularly empty the dust collection bag or container, and remove visible dirt from the filters and motor housing. The motor brush roll should be cleaned according to the specific model's instructions, typically every 25-30 uses or monthly. 

Store the vacuum in a clean, dry place, keep the battery charged between 40-60% to extend its lifespan, and avoid extreme temperature changes. Refer to the user manual for model-specific maintenance requirements. 


### What's the difference between Makita 40V and 60V systems?

Makita's 60V system provides twice the power of their 40V, delivering 65% more suction and running twice as long on a single charge. The 60V system is essential for professional-grade cleaning and handling tough dirt and debris. 

While 40V systems are suitable for everyday home cleaning, the increased capacity of 60V allows for faster cleaning, better performance in dusty environments, and the ability to use heavier attachments without degradation in suction power. 


### How much do Makita cordless vacuums cost?

Makita cordless vacuums range from $250 to $700, depending on model features and battery configuration. Entry-level models with a single 40V battery typically start at $250, while professional-grade 60V systems with dual battery packs cost around $600. 

Battery prices vary from $100 to $150 each, and additional accessories increase the total cost. The cost varies by region and retailer, so it's advisable to compare prices between authorized dealers.
