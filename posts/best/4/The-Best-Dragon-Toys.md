Many dragon toys, especially plush versions, feature soft fabrics and gentle textures, making them suitable for children with sensory sensitivities. The weighted elements in some plush toys can provide comforting sensory input. 

For children who may be overwhelmed by bright lights or loud sounds, it's important to choose toys with adjustable brightness and volume controls. Always supervise play and monitor the child's reaction to the toy's features. 


### How should Dragon Toys be maintained to extend their lifespan?

Regular dusting and cleaning with a soft cloth maintain the toy's appearance and extend its lifespan. Plush dragons should be spot cleaned only, using mild soap and water if necessary. Allow them to air dry completely before play.

All dragon toys should meet safety standards for the intended age group. Check for sharp edges, small parts that could be swallowed, and toxic materials. The toy's packaging should clearly indicate the recommended age range and safety features. 

Be aware of battery compartments and ensure they have secure closures. Check that electronic components are child-safe and that the toy's design prevents any small parts from becoming loose during play. 


### Can Dragon Toys be used for educational purposes?

Many dragon toys incorporate learning elements, such as early math concepts through building sets or vocabulary development through interactive stories. These educational aspects help develop cognitive skills while providing entertainment.
