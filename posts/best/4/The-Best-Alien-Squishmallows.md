## Buyer's Guide

Squishmallows are popular soft toys that combine cuddly comfort with cute designs. The Alien Squishmallows series features out-of-this-world characters with unique shapes and textures. When choosing your perfect Alien Squishmallow, consider the size, design elements, and material quality to find a toy that matches your preferences. 


### Size Considerations

Squishmallow sizes range from small travel-friendly options to extra-large cuddle companions. Think about where you'll store the toy and how much space you want it to take up. The plush texture requires careful handling to maintain its shape, so consider this when selecting the size. 


### Design Features

Each Alien Squishmallow has distinctive geometric shapes and metallic finishes. Some designs feature transparent elements or holographic effects, while others have textural details like ridges or bumps. The design choices can significantly impact the toy's appearance and tactile experience. 


### Material Quality

The plush material is a blend of polyester fibers, giving it a soft yet structured feel. Check for stitching quality, especially around the alien shapes and any texture features. Premium models use durable thread and reinforced stitching to maintain their shape over time. 


### Additional Considerations

Care instructions typically advise spot cleaning with a damp cloth, avoiding direct water exposure. The toys are machine washable but may lose their shape. Consider this maintenance requirement when choosing a design and color, as darker fabrics show soil more easily.
