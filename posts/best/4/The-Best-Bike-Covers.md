## FAQ

### Why protect your bike with a cover?

Protecting your bike with a cover prevents damage from weather elements like rain, snow, and direct sunlight. It also shields your bike from debris, corrosion, and theft when parked outside. 

A bike cover helps maintain your bike's appearance and extends its lifespan by keeping the frame, components, and paintwork in excellent condition. 


### What types of bike covers are available?

Bike covers come in two main types: drop-down covers that zip shut over your bike, and full-enclosure hard cases that protect your bike from all sides. 

Drop-down covers are generally more affordable and allow easy access to your bike. Full-enclosure cases offer better protection but are heavier and harder to transport.

### How do I measure my bike for a cover?

Measure the longest length of your bike including the handlebars and front fork. Also measure the total height from the ground to the top of the seat. 

Add 10-15% extra length to accommodate zipper overlap or case closure mechanisms. 


### What materials are bike covers made from?

Most bike covers are made from water-resistant or waterproof materials like polyester, PVC, or rubberized fabric. Some high-end covers feature breathable inner layers to prevent condensation buildup. 

The cover's bottom edge typically has an waterproof bottom seal made from rubber or neoprene for additional protection.

### How do I properly store a bike cover?

Hang the cover with the zipped section facing outward to allow air circulation and prevent mold. Store it in a dry place away from direct sunlight or heat sources. 

For full-enclosure cases, remove the bike completely and store it in a rack to prevent the cover from becoming distorted. 


### How long do bike covers last?

With regular use and proper storage, a quality bike cover typically lasts 3-5 years. Signs of wear like fraying edges, loose stitching, or material deterioration indicate it's time for a replacement. 

To extend your bike cover's lifespan, avoid storing it in damp environments and inspect it regularly for any signs of damage.
