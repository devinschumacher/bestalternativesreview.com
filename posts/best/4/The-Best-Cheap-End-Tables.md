## Buyer's Guide

When searching for affordable end tables, consider a few key factors to find the perfect piece for your space. This guide will help you understand important features and make informed decisions at every budget level. 


### Size and Space

Measure your available space before shopping to ensure the table fits comfortably. Consider the length of your sofa or bed to determine the ideal table width. Compact options are ideal for smaller rooms, while longer tables work well in larger spaces. Always allow a few inches between the table and surrounding furniture for easy movement. 


### Storage Needs

Add shelves, drawers, or open compartments based on your storage requirements. Shallow drawers work well for blankets and throw pillows, while open shelves display books and decorative items. Consider the material of your storage solutions - wood can display items beautifully, while metal offers a sleek, modern alternative. 


### Style Compatibility

Select a table that matches your existing decor in terms of material, finish, and style. Matte finishes resist fingerprints and add a subtle touch to any room, while glossy surfaces catch light and make rooms feel larger. The material should also match your furniture - wood complements natural materials, while metal pairs well with contemporary designs. 


### Budget Considerations

Set a budget and decide how much flexibility you have within that range. Basic end tables start at around $20 and offer essential functionality, while premium pieces exceed $100 with added features like USB ports and built-in chargers. Keep in mind that higher-priced items often offer better build quality and more thoughtful design details. 


## FAQ


### What is the ideal height for an end table?

End tables should typically be about 22-24 inches tall, which allows for comfortable reading and small object placement while maintaining proper room flow. 

A height difference of no more than 6 inches between your chair seat and the end table provides a natural resting point for your legs when seated. 


### What materials are most practical for end tables?

Engineered wood, MDF, and particle board are budget-friendly options that combine affordability with durability for end tables. 

Resin and metal finishes offer good value while providing resistance to scratches and dents from daily use. 


### How much weight can a cheap end table typically support?

Most basic end tables can support 25-30 pounds per shelf, suitable for holding books, decor items, and small potted plants. 

For heavier items or multiple shelves, consider models rated for at least 50 pounds per shelf. 


### What measurements should I take before buying an end table?

Measure the length and width of your available space, then add 6 inches to each dimension for clearance and stability. 

Check the depth of the space under your couch or beside your bed to ensure the table will fit comfortably. 


### Are cheap end tables available in various styles?

Basic designs in plain finishes like white, black, and natural wood are widely available for under $50. 

Decorative options with carved details or painted designs can be found for slightly higher prices. 


### What maintenance requirements should I consider?

Regular dusting with a microfiber cloth is all that's needed for most budget end tables. 

Spot clean spills immediately and consider sealants or protective coatings for added durability.
