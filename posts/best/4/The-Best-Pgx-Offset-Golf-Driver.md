This right-handed driver combines Mitsubishi's Tensei Pro CK shaft with a 9-degree loft for optimal ball flight. The 50g regular flex provides just the right amount of stiffness for consistent launches. The club has shown minor usage with some faint ball marks on the face and light grip wear, but overall maintains excellent condition with a clean appearance for its age.

The oversized 500cc head provides unmatched forgiveness, while the massive sweet spot helps improve contact and distance. The clean matte black finish is both stylish and practical. At 10.5 degrees loft, it's designed for maximum distance with a slightly offset pattern that might take some getting used to. While the USGA won't be impressed, this illegal driver might just impress you with its raw power potential.

## Buyer's Guide

Pgx offset golf drivers combine performance-enhancing features with a distinctive design. Understanding their key aspects helps golfers select the right club for their game. 


### Design and Aesthetics

PGX offset drivers typically feature a larger head profile with an extended face angle. This design not only adds visual appeal but also impacts swing mechanics and ball flight characteristics. The offset design positions the heel slightly behind the golf ball at address, promoting a more centered strike and natural swing path.

### Size and Orientation

Driver head sizes usually range between 430-460 cubic inches, with longer, more oversized models providing increased sweet spot and forgiveness. The face angle, typically 2-4 degrees open at address, influences ball launch parameters and trajectory. Modern PGX drivers often incorporate adjustable hosels for fine-tuning these properties based on individual swing characteristics. 


### Materials and Construction

Head compositions usually consist of lightweight titanium faces bonded to carbon fiber or metal body structures. This composite construction maximizes MOI (moment of inertia) while maintaining an optimal weight distribution. The face material thickness and stiffness vary based on intended ball speed and performance targets.

### Performance Characteristics

Offset drivers generally produce a higher, straighter ball flight with less side spin compared to non-offset models. This performance profile suits golfers with a more upright swing plane or those seeking increased accuracy. The club's overall weight distribution and balance point affect carry distance and workability, particularly on approach shots.

### What is an offset golf driver?

Offset drivers feature a forward-leaning clubface that creates additional space between the club's heel and the hosel. This design helps prevent the club from twisting at impact and can increase stability, especially for players who tend to slice the ball. 

The standard offset distance ranges from 0.5 to 1.5 inches. More significant offsets are beneficial for players with slower swing speeds or certain swing flaws, while minimal offset suits players who prefer a square clubface at impact. 


### How much does the Pgx offset driver weigh?

The Pgx offset driver weighs 455 grams, which is considered slightly heavier than average. This weight distribution contributes to its stability and forgiveness, particularly noticeable on off-center hits. 

The club's weight can be adjusted through interchangeable weights in the grip, offering a simple way to fine-tune your equipment based on your swing characteristics.

### What type of shaft is included with the Pgx driver?

The Pgx driver comes with a Project X Shaft that features an X flex rating. This stiffness level is appropriate for most average golfers with moderate swing speeds, between 85-95 mph. 

For players requiring different shaft properties, additional options are available through official channels or select retailers. The stock shaft's performance characteristics are optimized for distance and control. 


### How much does the Pgx driver vary in length?

These drivers typically measure 46 inches in length, which is the standard length for modern drivers. However, a 46.5-inch option is also available for taller players who need additional reach. 

The consistent length among Pgx drivers ensures proper fitting and setup across their lineup, making it easier to compare different models in the series. 

![Pgx-Offset-Golf-Driver-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Pgx-Offset-Golf-Driver-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Are the Pgx drivers compatible with different grip sizes?

Yes, the Pgx drivers are designed to accommodate various grip sizes, featuring two grip radius options and multiple knurling patterns. This adaptability helps players find their ideal grip configuration for comfort and control. 

The club's grip design prioritizes stabilization during the swing, particularly noticeable for players with longer fingers or specific hand shape preferences. 


### What are the primary benefits of the Pgx driver's offset design?

The offset design primarily benefits players with an inside-out swing path by helping square the face at impact and promoting a more consistent swing direction. It's particularly effective for avoiding the common right-to-left slice and improving ball flight stability. 

For players who naturally hit the ball slightly fat or low, the offset can create a shallower impact angle, potentially increasing ball height and overall distance while maintaining accuracy.
