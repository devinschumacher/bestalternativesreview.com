## Buyer's Guide

A permanent match is a specialized tool designed to ignite flammable materials without the need for an external flame source. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the right permanent match for your needs. 


### Types of Permanent Matches

Permanent matches come in three primary variants: lighter fluid matches, friction-ignition matches, and heat-sensitive matches. Lighter fluid matches feature a flammable liquid core, requiring an external flame for ignition. In contrast, friction-ignition matches rely on a pyrochemical compound activated by pressure or friction. Heat-sensitive matches initiate the reaction when exposed to warm temperatures. 

![Permanent-Match-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Permanent-Match-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Ignition Mechanism

Lighter fluid matches require an initial flame to ignite the liquid core, making them less convenient in low-temperature or wind-affected environments. Friction-ignition matches provide immediate ignition through manual activation, while heat-sensitive matches offer consistent performance across various temperature conditions. 


### Durability and Storage

Materials construction influences both longevity and reliability. Durable matches often feature waterproof coatings and protective casings. Storage requirements vary by type: lighter fluid matches must be stored in cool, dry environments, while friction-ignition and heat-sensitive matches have more flexible storage needs. 

![Permanent-Match-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Permanent-Match-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Application Specificity

Consider the intended use when selecting a match type. Lighter fluid matches excel in situations requiring multiple ignitions or in environments with high ambient temperatures. Friction-ignition matches are ideal for outdoor use or where chemical reactions are necessary. Heat-sensitive matches find applications in industrial settings where consistent ignition performance is crucial. 


## FAQ

![Permanent-Match-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Permanent-Match-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a Permanent Match?

A Permanent Match, also known as a butane match or lighted match, is a specialized tool that combines a striking surface with a built-in butane flame. Unlike traditional matches that produce an open flame, these matches maintain a steady, controlled flame for several seconds after ignition. 

The flame typically burns for 10-20 seconds, allowing users to light various materials including candles, fireplaces, and gas stoves with precision. This feature makes them particularly useful in cold weather or windy conditions where an open flame match might be difficult to light. 


### How Do Permanent Matches Work?

When a Permanent Match is struck against its metal surface, it activates the butane cartridge, which releases a steady stream of gas through a nozzle at the tip of the match. The flame ignites the gas, creating a reliable and long-burning flame at the end of the matchstick. 

The flame is contained within a metal casing that protects it from wind and ensures a consistent burn. Once lit, the match maintains its flame without requiring further striking. 

![Permanent-Match-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Permanent-Match-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What Are Permanent Matches Made Of?

Permanent Matches are typically made from a thin metal matchstick coated with a special non-toxic chemical compound that ignites when struck against the metal tip. The metal tip contains the butane cartridge and ignition mechanism. 

The matches are generally about 3 inches long, with the metal tip at one end and a protective sleeve covering the butane cartridge. The flame typically burns from the metal tip end of the matchstick. 


### How Long Do Permanent Matches Last?

Each Permanent Match usually provides one flame application, lasting 10-20 seconds. The butane cartridge can typically generate multiple matches before requiring replacement. 

The matches have a service life of approximately 2 years from production, after which the butane cartridge may lose pressure. It's important to store matches in a cool, dry place to maintain their effectiveness. 

![Permanent-Match-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Permanent-Match-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Where Can I Purchase Permanent Matches?

Permanent Matches are available in camping and outdoor supply stores, as well as online retailers specializing in camping equipment and emergency preparedness supplies. 

Popular brands include FireStarters butane matches, Bic Storm matches, and other specialized outdoor brands. It's recommended to purchase matches in sealed packaging to maintain their purity and longevity. 


### How Should I Store Permanent Matches?

Store matches in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat sources. The sealed packaging helps maintain their purity and prevent contamination. 

Avoid storing matches with any flammable materials or chemicals. If you're storing a large quantity, consider keeping them in a dedicated fireproof container for added safety.
