## Buyer's Guide

A Diono booster seat elevates your child to sit at the correct height for the vehicle's seatbelt, ensuring proper positioning and greater safety during travel. When selecting a Diono booster seat, consider several key factors to find the right fit for your child and vehicle. 


### Ergonomic Design and Comfort Features

Opt for a booster seat with adequate cushioning and a well-padded backrest. The seat cushion should maintain proper lumbar support for your child's lower back. Adjustable headrests are crucial as they prevent slouching and ensure the vehicle's headrest supports your child's occipital area. 


### Easy Installation and Compatibility

Most Diono booster seats use the vehicle's seatbelt system for installation. Ensure the seatbase securely clicks into place and the seatbelt fits snugly. Check the seat's compatibility with your vehicle's rear seat configuration, ensuring there's enough space for proper positioning. 


### Convertible vs. Dedicated Booster Seats

Convertible booster seats can transition from high-back to backless designs, offering flexibility as your child grows. Dedicated backless boosters are lighter and easier to move but require proper back support. Consider your primary seating needs and potential future upgrades when choosing between these options. 


### Size and Weight Limits

Check the seat's weight limit to ensure it matches your child's current and anticipated size. Most Diono boosters support children from 30-100 pounds. Also, verify the seat's height limits to ensure it remains properly positioned as your child grows. 


## FAQ


### What age range is suitable for Diono booster seats?

Diono booster seats are designed for children who have outgrown their car seats but still need extra height. The specific age range varies by model, typically ranging from 4 to 12 years old, or when the child reaches 4 feet 9 inches tall. 

Always refer to the manufacturer's guidelines for your specific Diono model, as height and weight requirements may differ. 


### Can Diono booster seats be used with either lap or shoulder harnesses?

Diono booster seats accommodate both lap and shoulder harnesses, providing flexibility based on your vehicle configuration and child's comfort. 

For optimal safety, always use the vehicle's lap and shoulder belt system with the booster seat, following the manufacturer's instructions for proper belt positioning. 


### What are the main differences between Diono's models?

Diono offers several models with varying features, including the Radian RSR (with a built-in headrest), Radian RSR 90 (with a 90-degree recline), and Radian G2 (a high-back model). 

The primary differences include back style (high-back vs. booster), weight capacity, and specific features like cup holders and headrest adjustments. 


### How much do Diono booster seats weigh?

The weight of Diono booster seats varies by model, typically ranging from 11 to 18 pounds. The Radian G2 and Radian RSR models are on the heavier side, while the Radian RSR 90 is slightly lighter. 

When selecting a booster seat, consider the weight difference between the seat and your child's weight to ensure ease of installation and mobility. 


### What materials are used to make Diono booster seats?

Diono booster seats are constructed from durable materials including polypropylene for the seat base, reinforced PVC for the backrest, and high-quality webbing for the harness straps. 

The padding is made from EPS foam encased in soft, washable fabric, providing both comfort and safety. 


### How do I clean and maintain a Diono booster seat?

To clean the booster seat, remove any detachable parts and wipe the seat surface with a damp cloth using mild soap and water. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners. 

Regularly check the seat belt straps for wear and ensure all parts are secure. The seat should be air-dried thoroughly before use to prevent moisture-related damage.
