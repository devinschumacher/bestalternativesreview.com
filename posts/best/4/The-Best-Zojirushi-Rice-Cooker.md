## FAQ


### Does the Zojirushi rice cooker automatically adjust cooking settings?

Yes, the Zojirushi rice cooker features advanced microcomputer technology that automatically adjusts cooking settings based on the type and variety of rice being cooked. This ensures perfectly cooked rice every time, without the need for manual adjustments. 

The cooker can recognize different rice types through built-in menus for over 100 varieties of rice, from short-grain sushi rice to long-grain basmati. It also adapts to changes in altitude, water quality, and rice moisture content to maintain consistent results. 


### How much rice can a Zojirushi cooker hold?

The standard capacity of Zojirushi rice cookers ranges from 2.2 to 8 cups (1.1 to 4 cups cooked rice), with some models offering even larger capacities. The amount of rice you can cook is determined by the specific model you select. 

Many models feature incremental measuring cups and guide marks on the inner pot, making it easy to measure the exact amount of rice and water needed for your cooking quantity. 


### What types of rice cookers are available in the Zojirushi lineup?

Zojirushi offers both electric rice cookers and multi-purpose cookers that can steam, cook rice, and keep food warm. Their most popular models include non-stick inner pots, precision temperature control, and keep-warm functions. 

The company also produces specialized rice cookers, such as those designed for sticky rice, multi-function cookers with additional settings for vegetables and soups, and models with delayed-start timers. 


### How long does it take to cook rice in a Zojirushi cooker?

Cooking time varies based on the rice variety and cooker model, but standard cooking cycles typically range from 40 to 60 minutes. For quick cooking, the 10-minute hot-hold function allows you to cook your rice in under an hour. 

Some models offer Express cooking options, which can cook certain types of rice in as little as 20 minutes, ideal for busy mornings or when you're short on time. 


### Are Zojirushi rice cookers suitable for all types of rice?

To ensure optimal results, the cooker includes multiple cooking programs specifically tailored to different rice types. This technology helps prevent overcooking or undercooking, common issues with rice cookers that don't adjust for specific rice varieties. 


### How does a Zojirushi rice cooker maintain temperature after cooking?

After the cooking cycle completes, Zojirushi rice cookers maintain an optimal temperature using their keep-warm function, which keeps the rice at serving temperature without further cooking. This typically lasts for 12 hours on most models. 

The cooker automatically switches to keep-warm mode once cooking is complete, preventing the rice from drying out or becoming mushy. Some models feature adjustable keep-warm settings, allowing you to control the temperature for different types of rice or dishes.
