## Buyer's Guide

The Medela Pump In Style parts can significantly impact your pumping experience's effectiveness and comfort. Understanding the key components and their importance will help you choose the right accessories for your needs. 


### Collection and Storage Parts

Key collection parts include the pump flange and collection kit. The pump flange size (2, 3, or 4) should match your preferred breast shape and size. Consider getting multiple flanges to accommodate different feedings or personal preferences. The collection kit connects to your pump and allows milk collection, with various sizes available to match your flange choice. 


### Storage Solutions

Storage bags and bottles are essential for saving expressed milk. Freezer-grade bags prevent air exposure, maintaining milk quality during storage. Bottles should be BPA-free and compatible with your pump's storage system. Consider purchasing in quantities that match your typical pumping schedule. 


### Power and Charging Options

The pump's power source affects mobility and convenience. Rechargeable batteries offer flexibility without tethers, ideal for on-the-go pumping. When choosing a charger, consider compatibility with your local power outlets and the number of pumps you need to charge simultaneously. 


### Additional Accessories

Consider accessories like cooling packs for hot milk, tubing covers for protection during transport, and portable bags for discreet storage. Evaluate space requirements for storing these items and how they will impact your pumping routine. 


## FAQ


### What are the compatible parts for the Medela Pump In Style pump?

The Medela Pump In Style comes with essential parts for daily use, including two pumps, a carry case, and storage bottles. Additional parts are available for purchase separately, such as power cords, universal bases for different power sources, and storage accessories. 

The most common additional parts requested are power cords for travel or home use, universal bases that work with both US and UK power sources, and extra storage bottles for larger milk volumes. Always check Medela's website for the most up-to-date list of compatible parts. 


### How do I properly clean and maintain the Medela Pump In Style parts?

Medela recommends cleaning the pump parts after each use. Use warm water and mild soap to hand wash the pieces, making sure to rinse thoroughly. The clear parts of the pump can be wiped with a damp cloth, while the motor parts should be cleaned with a dry cloth. 

After washing, allow all parts to air dry completely before using them again. It's important not to place the pump in a dishwasher, as this can damage the motor and electrical components. 


### What's the difference between the Medela Pump In Style and the Medela Pump In Style Plus?

The Medela Pump In Style and the Medela Pump In Style Plus share many similarities, but the plus version includes an extra comfort cushion in the pump base and a faster-pulse wave technology that mimics the baby's natural feeding pattern. The plus version also features an adjustable flow rate and a more advanced compression system. 

The standard Pump In Style offers effective milk removal with comfortable positioning, while the plus version builds on this foundation with enhanced comfort and stimulation features. 


### How long does the Medela Pump In Style battery last?

The Medela Pump In Style runs on a rechargeable battery that lasts approximately 120 minutes on a single charge. This provides enough runtime for a complete pumping session, including pre-pump positioning and cool-down time. 

When the battery is low, it automatically switches to battery mode, where it runs on stored energy. The pump will display a low battery warning when you need to plug it in for charging. 


### Can the Medela Pump In Style be used with frozen breast shields?

Medela's pumping system works effectively with both frozen and unfrozen breast shields. Using frozen shields can further increase milk flow by keeping the breast at a cooler temperature during pumping. 

However, it's important to use the correct size and type of shield for your breast tissue. Always follow Medela's guidelines for breast shield selection and usage. 


### How long is the warranty for the Medela Pump In Style parts?

Medela offers a one-year warranty on their Pump In Style parts, covering manufacturing defects and malfunctions. This warranty covers both the pump itself and any included accessories purchased through an authorized dealer. 

Before contacting Medela about a warranty claim, ensure that the part is still under warranty, check if it's covered under the terms, and follow their specific claims process.
