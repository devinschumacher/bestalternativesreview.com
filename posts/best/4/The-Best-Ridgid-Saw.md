## Buyer's Guide

A Ridgid saw combines power and precision for demanding cutting tasks. Understanding key features will help you choose the right saw for your project. 


### Power Source

Ridgid saws operate on either batteries or electricity. Battery-powered models offer flexibility and quiet operation but have limited runtime. Electric saws provide consistent power but require a reliable electrical source nearby.
