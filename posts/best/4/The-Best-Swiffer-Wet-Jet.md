## FAQ


### What is the Swiffer Wet Jet?

The Swiffer Wet Jet is a self-cleaning washable mop that combines a spinning cloth with a steam cleaning system to clean floors. It applies an appropriate amount of water and cleaning solution directly to the mopping pad without requiring you to touch or handle cleaning fluids. 

The system consists of a base unit that holds cleaning solution and water, a motorizedhead that houses the microfiber mopping pad, and the cleaning solution tank that's connected to the base unit. After each use, the system automatically rinses and spins the pad to remove dirt and bacteria. 


### How does the Swiffer Wet Jet work?

To use the Swiffer Wet Jet, you fill the base unit with water and cleaning solution, insert the motorizedhead, and turn it on. The system pumps solution through the connected pad, which spins to apply an even coat â€“ typically about two ounces per square foot. It then rinses and rotates the pad 2,500 times per minute to clean while spinning out excess water and dirt. 

The process removes 99.9% of bacteria, according to the manufacturer, due to the combination of spinning action and built-in sanitizing. After use, the system self-rinses the pad and dries it to prevent bacteria growth before the next use. 


### What surfaces can the Swiffer Wet Jet clean?

The Wet Jet is suitable for most hard floors, including hardwood, laminate, tile, and vinyl. It's not recommended for carpeted areas or areas with deep pile. 

While it effectively cleans dirt and grime, the cleaning effectiveness on surfaces with excessive build-up, such as excessive wax or grease, may be reduced. Always refer to the manufacturer's guidelines for the best results on specific surfaces. 


### How long does a full cleaning cycle take?

A typical cleaning cycle takes about 4 to 5 minutes, depending on the size of the area you're cleaning. The cycle includes cleaning, rinsing, and drying of the mopping pad. 

The base unit holds enough water to clean multiple areas, so you typically only need to fill it once per mopping session. The motorizedhead runs continuously during the cycle, so refilling or stopping mid-cycle is not necessary. 


### How should I maintain the Swiffer Wet Jet?

After each use, disconnect the motorizedhead from the base unit and empty the used cleaning solution tank. Rinse the tank with water to prevent mineral buildup and store it with the lid open to prevent debris from entering. 

Disconnect the motorizedhead from the base unit and wash the mopping pad thoroughly with water and mild detergent. Allow it to air dry completely before placing it back on the base unit. The base unit should be kept clean and dry, with any spills or residue promptly cleaned. 


### What cleaning solutions work with the Swiffer Wet Jet?

The system is compatible with Swiffer's own cleaning solutions, including their Daily Clean, All-Purpose, and specialized solutions for pet odors and allergies. These solutions are designed to work specifically with the Wet Jet system for optimal performance. 

If using third-party solutions, ensure they're specifically formulated for use with Swiffer systems to maintain the pad's effectiveness and prevent clogging. Always dilute concentrated solutions according to the manufacturer's instructions before use.
