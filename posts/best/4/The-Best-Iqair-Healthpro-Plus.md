## Buyer's Guide

The IQAir HealthPro Plus is a high-efficiency air purifier designed for homes and offices, offering advanced filtration for improved indoor air quality. This guide outlines key features and considerations when selecting an air purifier to help you make an informed decision. 


### Filter Technology and Efficiency

High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters are essential for capturing airborne pollutants. Look for a unit withTrue HEPA filtrationthat can remove 99.97% of particles as small as 0.1 microns. The HealthPro Plus, for example, uses a pre-filter and HEPASilent True HEPA filter for comprehensive particle removal. 


### Coverage Area and Air Changes per Hour (ACH)

Calculate the square footage of your space and consider the purifier's air delivery rate. The HealthPro Plus delivers 550 cubic feet per minute of clean air, making it suitable for rooms up to 383 square feet. Air changes per hour (ACH) indicate how quickly the unit can cycle through and filter the room's air. Aim for at least 3-4 ACH for effective filtration in a standard room size. 


### Pre-Filter and Maintenance Requirements

Pre-filters trap larger particles and extend the life of the main filter. The HealthPro Plus includes washable fabric pre-filters that should be washed monthly. Replace the True HEPA filter according to the manufacturer's recommended schedule, typically every 6-12 months based on usage and local air quality. 


### Acoustic Considerations

Some air purifiers operate quietly, while others can be quite loud. The HealthPro Plus runs at 23 decibels in sleep mode, making it suitable for use in bedrooms and other quiet environments. Consider the unit's noise level, especially if you need it to run overnight or in shared spaces. 


## FAQ


### How does the Iqair Healthpro Plus improve indoor air quality?

The Iqair Healthpro Plus uses a 5-stage filtration process to remove pollutants, including particles, gases, and odors from indoor air.

### What maintenance is required for the Iqair Healthpro Plus?

### How does the air quality monitor work, and what's its range?

The built-in sensor measures PM2.5, CO2 levels, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), displaying the data on a color-coded LED status display. Users can view real-time indoor air quality data through the companion app, which has a range of up to 100 meters from the device. 

The display shows air quality in both numeric and visual forms, with green indicating clean air and red indicating poor air quality. The app also provides hourly air quality trends and historical data, helping users identify patterns and take appropriate actions. 


### What's the noise level of the Iqair Healthpro Plus?

The device operates at ultra-low noise levels, with whisper-quiet nighttime function settings that reduce fan speed to 30 decibels - equivalent to a whisper. During active filtration, the sound level ranges from 30 to 47 decibels, making it suitable for bedrooms, home offices, and living rooms. 

The sound levels are measured in A-weighted decibels (dBA) to better represent human hearing sensitivity. The low setting operates at 30 dBA, while the medium setting produces 43 dBA, and high setting achieves 47 dBA. The device includes a simple push-button control for selecting the desired operating mode. 


### How does the Iqair Healthpro Plus save energy?

The Iqair Healthpro Plus has a power consumption of 27 watts in eco-mode and 48.3 watts in standard mode. The energy efficiency is comparable to other top-tier air purifiers in the same category, making it an eco-friendly choice for managing indoor air quality. 


### Can the Iqair Healthpro Plus handle strong odors?

The device's washable carbon washable filter cartridge effectively removes common household odors such as cooking smells, pet odors, and musty air, thanks to its activated carbon technology. The filter cartridge can handle strong odors for 3-6 months, depending on usage and environmental factors. 

For particularly strong odors or heavy smoke events, running the device on the highest setting for 6-12 hours may be necessary to fully eliminate the smell. The washable carbon filter cartridge should be replaced every 3 months in smoking households or environments with frequent strong odors.
