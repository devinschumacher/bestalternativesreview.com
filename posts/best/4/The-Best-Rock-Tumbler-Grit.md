## Buyer's Guide

A rock tumbler uses abrasion to smooth and round rocks through a process similar to natural weathering. The grit you choose for your tumbler determines the rate and effectiveness of this process. Understanding the different grit options and their applications will help you achieve your desired rock finish. 


### Understanding Grit Ratings

Grit ratings refer to the coarseness of the abrasive material in your tumbler. Higher grit numbers indicate finer abrasives, while lower numbers represent coarse abrasives. The most common grit ranges are 60, 120, 240, and 600. 


### Starting with Coarse Grit

Begin your rock tumbling process with coarse grit, typically 60 or 120, to crush larger rock particles and remove sharp edges. This stage helps create consistent surfaces for polishing. 


### Moving to Fine Grit

Gradually progress to finer grit levels (240 and 600) to smooth and polish your rocks. Each successive grit refines the surface, removing scratches from the previous stage and increasing the overall shine. 


### Considerations for Grit Selection

Select grit size based on your rock type and desired finish. Softer rocks require less aggressive abrasives, while harder rocks may need multiple grit stages. Always use dedicated grit bags to prevent contamination and ensure consistent results. 


## FAQ


### What is rock tumbler grit?

Rock tumbler grit consists of small abrasive particles that polish and smooth rocks during the tumbling process. These particles come in different grades, each suitable for specific stages of polishing and different rock types. 

The most common grit materials include aluminum oxide, walnut shells, and ceramic beads. Each material has distinct characteristics affecting the polishing speed and quality. 


### How is rock tumbler grit measured?

Rock tumbler grit sizes are measured in microns or mesh size. Smaller numbers represent coarser grit, while larger numbers indicate finer grit. For example, 40-60 mesh is considered coarse, 150-220 mesh medium, and 320-400 mesh fine. 

Most manufacturers provide recommended grit sequences, starting with coarser grits for initial grinding and progressing to finer grits for polishing. 


### What is the difference between aluminum oxide and ceramic grit?

Aluminum oxide grit is highly durable and effective for grinding stubborn rock surfaces. It's commonly used across all tumbling stages due to its consistent performance and affordability. 

Ceramic grit is more susceptible to chipping but offers superior polishing capabilities. It's particularly effective in the final stages of tumbling when precise surface finish is required. 


### How long does a bag of grit typically last?

A single bag of rock tumbler grit can effectively process dozens of rocks, depending on their size and hardness. A 10-pound bag usually lasts 30-50 tumbling cycles, with each cycle processing 1-2 rocks. 

Regular maintenance by changing grit between stages ensures optimal performance, extending the lifespan of both your grit and tumbler equipment. 


### Can I reuse rock tumbler grit?

Reusing rock tumbler grit is generally not recommended due to contamination from different rock types and the accumulation of rock dust, which reduces effectiveness. 

If you need to reuse grit, thoroughly clean it by sifting through a mesh screen and washing with water to remove all debris before reactivating it in your tumbling process. 


### What factors affect grit performance?

Grit performance is significantly influenced by water quality, with hard water containing minerals that can reduce polishing effectiveness. Using distilled water and maintaining proper water levels in your tumbler can improve results. 

Agitation rate and tumbling time also impact grit performance. Rock tumblers with faster rotation speeds require less time but may need more frequent grit changes to maintain effective polishing action.
