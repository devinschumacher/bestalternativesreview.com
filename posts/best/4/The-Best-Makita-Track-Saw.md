## Buyer's Guide

A Makita track saw is a specialized power tool used for cutting through various materials, particularly suitable for professional and DIY projects requiring precise and efficient cuts. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the most appropriate model for your needs. 


### Power and Performance

Makita track saws vary in power output, measured in volts, with higher voltage models offering more cutting capacity. Consider the type of materials you'll be cutting - wood, metal, plastic - as this affects the required blade type and motor specifications. The saw's weight and balance also impact ergonomics and control during extended use. 

![Makita-Track-Saw-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Makita-Track-Saw-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Cutting Capacity and Blade Compatibility

The maximum cutting depth and diameter determine a track saw's versatility. Common blade types include metal cutting, wood cutting, and specialized blades for aluminum and plastic. The blade height and rail system should match your workpiece size and material type to ensure both efficiency and safety. 


### Track System and Guide Rails

The track system's compatibility affects the saw's stability and precision. Longer guide rails provide more cutting length while maintaining straight cuts. The track's material (metal or plastic) influences durability and weight, with metal tracks offering better rigidity for power drilling. 

![Makita-Track-Saw-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Makita-Track-Saw-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Additional Features

Key features include variable speed control, adjustable height settings, and ergonomic grips for improved user comfort. Makita track saws with built-in lasers enhance accuracy by aligning the cut path. Consider tools with dust collection systems to maintain a cleaner work area during extended use. 


## FAQ

![Makita-Track-Saw-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Makita-Track-Saw-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a Makita track saw?

A Makita track saw combines the precision of a circular saw with the stability of a track system. The motor and blade attachment system mount to a guided track, allowing for straight, accurate cuts in materials up to 6 inches thick. 

The track system consists of two components: a rail that runs along the cutting line and a T-beam that provides additional support and stability. This design reduces vibration and allows for faster cutting with fewer passes. 


### What size track saws does Makita offer?

Makita offers track saws in two primary sizes: 10-inch and 12-inch blade diameters. The larger blade cuts through thicker materials but requires more powerful tools and potentially more robust support for the track system. 

The smaller 10-inch models offer comparable precision with more manageable weight and portability, making them suitable for both professional use and occasional heavy-duty projects. 

![Makita-Track-Saw-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Makita-Track-Saw-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How does the track system work?

The track system consists of a T-beam that acts as the foundation and a sliding rail that runs along the intended cutting line. The saw mounts to the rail, which is positioned correctly using adjustable clamps. 

When cutting, the blade follows the rail's path, guided by the T-beam's stability. This prevents wavering and ensures that the cut remains true to the marked line throughout the process. 


### What types of materials can a Makita track saw cut?

Makita track saws excel at cutting through various materials including wood, plastic, metal, and composites. They are particularly effective for crosscutting and ripping operations. 

While capable of handling dense materials, proper blade selection is crucial for optimal performance. Makita offers specialized blades for each material type to ensure clean, accurate cuts. 

![Makita-Track-Saw-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Makita-Track-Saw-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do I maintain a Makita track saw?

Regular maintenance includes checking blade tension, lubricating moving parts, and cleaning both the motor and track system after each use. The blade and motor housing should be free of debris and properly greased. 

Tracks should be inspected for wear and cleaned regularly to prevent scoring or damage that could affect cutting accuracy. Following the manufacturer's guidelines ensures optimal tool performance and longevity. 


### What accessories are available for Makita track saws?

Makita offers a range of accessories to enhance functionality and versatility, including different blade sizes and types, spare T-beams and rails for track systems, and carrying cases for transport. 

Additional features like dust collection attachments and blade guard options can improve both safety and cutting efficiency when working with the track saw.
