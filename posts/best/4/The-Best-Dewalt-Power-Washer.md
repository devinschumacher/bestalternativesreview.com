## Buyer's Guide

A Dewalt power washer is a versatile cleaning tool that delivers high-pressure water to remove dirt, grime, and debris from various surfaces. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the right power washer for your cleaning needs. 


### Power and Pressure

Power is measured in watts, with higher wattage generally providing more cleaning force. Pressure is rated in pounds per square inch (psi) and affects how effectively the washer can remove stubborn dirt. Common pressure ranges for household use are 1,200 to 2,000 psi, while commercial models often exceed 2,500 psi. 


### Water Flow and Consumption

Water flow is measured in gallons per minute (gpm), influencing the washer's cleaning speed and effectiveness. Higher flow rates increase water usage and power consumption. Consider your water source capacity and local water restrictions when selecting a model. 


### Gun and Spray Tips

The trigger gun and interchangeable spray tips allow adjusting the water flow and pressure for different cleaning tasks. Common spray patterns include fan, flat fan, and fog nozzles, each suitable for specific applications. The reach and durability of the spray gun are also important factors. 


### Safety Features and Ergonomics

Look for power washers with overload protection, which prevents motor damage from excessive pressure or water flow. Ergonomic designs with comfortable grip surfaces and well-placed controls improve user comfort during extended use. Safety features like leakage detection and automatic shut-off protect both the equipment and the operator. 


## FAQ


### What is a Dewalt power washer?

A Dewalt power washer is a high-pressure cleaning tool that uses powerful water jets to remove dirt, grime, and debris from surfaces. It's renowned for its durability and performance, making it a popular choice for both residential and commercial cleaning applications. 

These professional-grade washers feature robust construction and reliable motors, with features like adjustable pressure settings and extended warranties that set them apart from less expensive alternatives. 


### What surfaces can a Dewalt power washer clean?

A Dewalt power washer can safely clean a wide variety of surfaces, including concrete, brick, wood, metal, and glass. The high pressure makes them excellent for removing stubborn dirt, oil stains, and paint from these materials. 

However, due to the intense cleaning power, they should not be used on painted surfaces, finished woods, or delicate materials that might be damaged by direct water impact. 


### How powerful is a typical Dewalt power washer?

The typical Dewalt power washer delivers between 2,000 to 4,000 pounds per square inch (psi) of water pressure, which is strong enough to remove most contaminants but not as extreme as industrial models. 

For reference, 2,000 psi is suitable for lighter cleaning tasks like cleaning driveways and siding, while 4,000 psi is reserved for more demanding applications like cleaning commercial walkways and removing tough grease stains. 


### What maintenance does a Dewalt power washer require?

Regular maintenance of a Dewalt power washer includes checking and tightening the mounting bolts, inspecting the motor for damage, and cleaning the filters. The pump and motor should be checked for proper operation before each use. 

After use, the hose and wand should be stored properly to prevent kinking, and the unit should be drained of water to prevent mineral buildup and corrosion. 


### How long do Dewalt power washers last?

With proper care, a Dewalt power washer typically lasts between 5 to 10 years, with professional models often exceeding this lifespan due to their robust construction and reliable components. 

Regular maintenance, regular inspection for wear and tear, and storing the unit in a dry, covered area will significantly extend its operational life. 


### What safety precautions should be taken when using a Dewalt power washer?

Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment, including safety glasses, gloves, and protective footwear when operating a Dewalt power washer. The high-pressure water can cause serious injury if the nozzle or hose fails. 

Keep bystanders and pets at a safe distance, use the appropriate pressure setting for the surface you're cleaning, and ensure the safety shut-off valve is functioning properly before each use.
