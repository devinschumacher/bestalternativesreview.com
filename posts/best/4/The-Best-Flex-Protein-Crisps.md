Nutritional yeast and savory seasoning blends enhance flavor while providing additional health benefits.

## FAQ


### What are Flex Protein Crisps?

Flex Protein Crisps are a nutritious snack combining crispy baked sheets with added protein. These convenient snacks come in various flavors and can be a great addition to your protein intake. 

Each serving typically contains around 10-15 grams of protein, making them suitable for meal replacement or post-workout snacks. The crispy sheets are baked rather than fried, which helps in maintaining a lower calorie count while keeping the texture enjoyable. 


### What ingredients should I look for?

When selecting Flex Protein Crisps, look for products made from whole food ingredients. Common quality ingredients include eggs, dairy proteins, and plant-based proteins like pea or brown rice protein. Avoid products with artificial flavors, excessive added sugars, or hydrogenated oils. 

Each brand may have different ingredient profiles, so it's important to check the label of the specific product you're considering. Some might include additional ingredients like fiber, vitamin blends, or healthy fats, which can enhance the nutritional value. 


### How do they compare to regular crisps?

Flex Protein Crisps offer a much higher protein content than traditional potato chips or corn chips. While regular crisps provide about 10-15% of the daily value for protein, protein crisps can provide 25-30% of your daily protein needs per serving. 

The nutritional benefit of protein crisps comes from their protein content and lower carbohydrate count compared to regular snack chips. However, they still contain calories, so they should be consumed as part of a balanced diet. 


### Are these snacks suitable for different dietary needs?

Flex Protein Crisps come in various forms to accommodate different dietary preferences. Most products are suitable for people following general healthy-eating guidelines, but some options are specifically tailored for vegetarian, vegan, or low-carb diets. 

If you have specific dietary requirements like gluten-free or soy-free, check the packaging carefully or contact the manufacturer to ensure the product meets your needs. 


### How should I store them?

To maintain their crispness and extend their shelf life, store Flex Protein Crisps in an airtight container or the original packaging in a cool, dry place. Most varieties have a best-by date range from 6-12 months from production, so check the label for specific instructions. 

Avoid storing them in the refrigerator unless specified on the package. Refrigeration can make the crispy sheets soft and less enjoyable, especially for varieties with dairy or egg components. 


### Do they keep well in travel?

Flex Protein Crisps are relatively durable for travel snacks if kept in an airtight container. The crisp sheets don't require refrigeration unless specified on the packaging, making them suitable for both road trips and short domestic flights. 

Note that some varieties with liquid ingredients or soft coatings may not maintain their texture well during travel. For the best experience, plan to consume them within a few days of opening, especially if storing them in a backpack or purse.
