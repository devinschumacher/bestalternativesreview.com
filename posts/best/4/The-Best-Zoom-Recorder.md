## Buyer's Guide

The Zoom Recorder captures your Zoom meetings and presentations, but selecting the right version requires understanding your specific needs. Choose between downloading the app directly or using a compatible browser. Consider your storage requirementsâ€”free versions often limit saved meeting length while premium options expand capacity. For collaboration, check if multiple users can access recordings simultaneously without additional cost. 


### Storage and File Formats

Standard plans provide basic storage, though premium tiers offer increased capacity and longer meeting durations. Zoom Recorder supports various file formats, with MP4 being the most common for video meetings.

### Access and Sharing

Recipients receive a link to view recordings, with options for setting meeting passwords and expiry dates. Consider how easily you can share these linksâ€”direct email, social media integration, or direct download capabilities can enhance usability.
