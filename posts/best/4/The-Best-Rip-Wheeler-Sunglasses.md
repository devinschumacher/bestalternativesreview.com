## Buyer's Guide

Rip Wheelers offer a blend of performance and protection specifically tailored for water sports enthusiasts. These sunglasses combine uv protection with features that address the challenges of aquatic environments, making them an essential addition to your summer gear. 


### UV Protection Standards

Water reflects up to 80% of UV rays, significantly increasing exposure. Look for lenses with at least 99% UV protection across UVA and UVB spectra. Some models offer Polarized Plus2 technology, which enhances UV blocking while reducing glare. 

![Rip-Wheeler-Sunglasses-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Rip-Wheeler-Sunglasses-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Impact Resistance and Construction

Aquatic activities increase the risk of accidental impacts. Rimless or semi-rimless designs, while offering a sleek profile, provide less protection than full-rim alternatives. The temples and frames should be made from impact-resistant materials like polycarbonate or rubberized components. 


### Venting and Lens Options

Water sports generate significant moisture and splashes. Opt for models with strategic ventilation to prevent fogging. Lens options range from polarized for visual clarity to tinted variations for specific conditions like snow or bright sunlight.

### Fit and Adjustment Options

A proper fit prevents slippage during intense activities. Adjustability through nose pads, temple wings, and frame tension helps maintain a secure fit. Some models feature interchangeable lenses or frames, allowing customization for different conditions and preferences. 


## FAQ

![Rip-Wheeler-Sunglasses-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Rip-Wheeler-Sunglasses-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What materials are Rip Wheeler sunglasses made from?

Rip Wheeler sunglasses are crafted from durable, lightweight materials including polycarbonate lenses and hypoallergenic frames. The frames come in both metal and plastic varieties, with many styles featuring interchangeable lens options to protect against various light conditions. 

The lenses provide 100% UV protection and come in a range of polarized and non-polarized options, depending on the model. This combination of materials and lens types makes them suitable for both casual wear and outdoor activities. 


### What sizes are available?

Rip Wheeler offers multiple frame sizes to accommodate different face shapes and preferences. The most popular styles range from 48mm to 60mm in temple length, with some models featuring adjustable nose pads and temple tips for a customized fit.

### How do their polarized lenses work?

Polarized lenses reduce glare from reflective surfaces like water, snow, and concrete by filtering out horizontally polarized light. This makes them particularly effective for outdoor sports and activities where glare can interfere with visibility. 

The polarization works by aligning the lens molecules in a specific direction, allowing only vertically polarized light to pass through. This results in clearer, more comfortable vision without distorting colors or contrast. 


### Are these sunglasses appropriate for water sports?

Yes, Rip Wheeler sunglasses are specifically designed for water sports and other aquatic activities. The durable polycarbonate lenses and splash-resistant construction protect against saltwater and chlorinated pool environments. 

Many styles feature wrap-around designs that keep water and spray out while maintaining peripheral vision. The secure fit and interchangeable lens system also ensure they stay in place during intense aquatic activities. 

![Rip-Wheeler-Sunglasses-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Rip-Wheeler-Sunglasses-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How do they compare to other competitive brands?

Compared to similar water sports sunglasses, Rip Wheeler offers a broader range of lens color options and UV protection levels. Their interchangeable lens system provides more customization compared to fixed-lens competitors. 

While some premium brands offer higher-priced customization options, Rip Wheeler strikes a balance between performance features and affordability, making them competitive in terms of value and functionality. 


### What's the return policy if I'm not satisfied?

Rip Wheeler offers a satisfaction guarantee with most purchases. If you're not satisfied with your sunglass purchase, you can return it within 30 days for a full refund or exchange. 

The company recommends trying the glasses in natural light to check fit and lens color before returning them. For complete details, including any special conditions, visit their official website or contact customer service directly.
