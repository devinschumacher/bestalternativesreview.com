## FAQ


### What is Nulo Dog Food?

Each Nulo formula focuses on specific dietary needs, with options for weight management, joint support, and digestive health. The brand's commitment to transparency and nutritional excellence has made them a popular choice among pet owners seeking premium alternatives. 


### What Makes Nulo Different from Other Dog Food Brands?

Unlike many conventional dog food brands that rely heavily on grain fillers and artificial additives, Nulo specializes in premium protein sources and whole-food ingredients. Their formulations are designed to support specific health needs, offering products for weight management, joint care, and digestive health. 

The brand stands out through their transparent ingredient sourcing and nutritional focus, prioritizing natural components over artificial preservatives and colorings. Nulo's commitment to quality and pet health has earned them a reputation as a premium dog food choice. 


### Are Nulo Products Safe for All Dogs?

While Nulo products are generally safe for healthy dogs, it's important to note that specific formulations may not be suitable for all pets. For instance, grain-free options may not be appropriate for dogs with grain sensitivities or for owners following a grain-free diet preference. 

Before switching your dog's diet, consult with your veterinarian to ensure the chosen Nulo formula meets your pet's specific nutritional needs and health requirements. 


### Can Nulo Dog Food Be Fed Raw?

The Nulo brand explicitly recommends cooking their products as their manufacturing process uses heat to ensure food safety and ingredient preservation. Raw feeding requires careful consideration of nutrient balance and bacterial concerns, making it essential to follow Nulo's recommended preparation method. 

While raw feeding can be beneficial for some dogs, Nulo's cooked formulas provide a convenient and safe alternative that meets their nutritional standards. Always consult with your veterinarian before making significant changes to your dog's diet. 


### What Size Portion Should I Feed My Dog?

Nulo provides feeding guideline suggestions on their product packaging, but individual needs may vary based on your dog's size, activity level, and specific health requirements. It's important to monitor your pet's weight and adjust portions accordingly to maintain an ideal body condition. 

For accurate feeding recommendations, consider your dog's age, breed, and activity level when selecting the appropriate size bag or formula. Regular veterinary check-ups can help ensure your dog is receiving the proper nutrition for their specific needs. 


### How Long Does Nulo Dog Food Stay Fresh After Opening?

After opening, Nulo dog food should be stored in a cool, dry place and used within 4-6 weeks to maintain optimal freshness and nutrient retention. The short shelf life after opening is due to their commitment to using natural preservatives and maintaining food quality. 

Store opened bags in an airtight container to protect the food from exposure to air, which can degrade the quality and shorten the shelf life. Always check for freshness and signs of spoilage before offering food to your pet.
