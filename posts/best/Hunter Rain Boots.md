Living in a wet and unpredictable climate has required me to invest in high-quality rain boots. Recently, I decided to give the Hunter Footwear Women's Original Short Gloss Rain Boots a try. Here's my take on these stylish and functional companions for my urban adventures. 

The Hunter Footwear boots seem to be an ideal choice for those who often find themselves in soggy situations. Handcrafted with natural rubber, these boots have a high-gloss finish that adds both style and durability. My experience using these rain boots has been nothing short of extraordinary. 

One of the main features of these boots that stand out is their superior protection against rain and other elements. Despite the shorter length, they provide excellent protection, keeping my feet dry and warm during heavy downpours or snowy conditions. 

However, I noticed that the boot sizing might not be the best fit for every individual. When ordering, I found it necessary to consider the fact that some of us have different foot shapes and sizes. A size that could fit perfectly for one person, might not for another. 

Despite the minor fitting issues, the Hunter Footwear Women's Original Short Gloss Rain Boots remain a reliable and stylish choice for those living in wet climates. These boots not only keep your feet dry during wet weather, but their high-gloss finish makes them a perfect companion for any stylish outfit.

As I'm always a fan of rainy days with the little ones, we've been playing in puddles all winter long and I needed something to keep their feet dry.

### [Hunter Women's Classic Chelsea Rain Boots](https://serp.ly/amazon/Hunter+Rain+Boots?utm\_term=hunter-womens-classic-chelsea-rain-boots)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Hunter+Rain+Boots?utm_term=hunter-womens-classic-chelsea-rain-boots"><img alt="hunter-black-womens-original-chelsea-boots-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hunter-black-womens-original-chelsea-boots-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Hunter Original Handcrafted Rubber Boots: Knee-High Waterproof & Comfortable Rain Boots](https://serp.ly/amazon/Hunter+Rain+Boots?utm\_term=hunter-original-handcrafted-rubber-boots-knee-high-waterproof-comfortable-rain-boots)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Hunter+Rain+Boots?utm_term=hunter-original-handcrafted-rubber-boots-knee-high-waterproof-comfortable-rain-boots"><img alt="hunter-original-boot-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hunter-original-boot-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Made of vulcanized natural rubber, the overall look and feel of these boots are truly stunning. Not to mention, Hunter boots are crafted with an immense level of detail by hand, which only adds to its charm. 

One aspect that particularly stands out is the comfort cushioned footbed. It's such a joy to slip these on during those early, chilly mornings. My only concern might be the size of the shaft, which did vary slightly depending on the size. For instance, the Big Kids size I purchased was pretty spot on for my feet size, offering just the right balance between style and functionality. 

Of course, rain boots can come and go with different color options, which is why this classic, polished puddle splash style just shines! My experience with these boots has shown that they keep my feet dry and comfortable. Plus, the added reflective safety patches make these boots a smart and stylish choice for those rainy days. The woven nylon lining adds an extra layer of insulation. 

My biggest gripe, though, is the potential issue of a white wax film appearing on the surface of the boot, known as blooming. It's not considered a defect but can be somewhat unsightly. The brand mentions that it's caused by extreme temperatures and won't affect the boot's longevity or functionality. 

Overall, I'd highly recommend the Hunter Original Boot. Its blend of style, quality, and comfort makes it a top-notch boot for those rainy days.

### [Hunter Men's Original Tall Black Rain Boots](https://serp.ly/amazon/Hunter+Rain+Boots?utm\_term=hunter-mens-original-tall-black-rain-boots)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Hunter+Rain+Boots?utm_term=hunter-mens-original-tall-black-rain-boots"><img alt="hunter-mens-original-tall-rain-boots-black-10" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hunter-mens-original-tall-rain-boots-black-10/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

With their 28 separate pieces, handmade from natural rubber, they provide unparalleled quality and a long-lasting shine. The wellingtons are waterproof, ensuring your feet stay dry in any weather condition. Filled with Hunter's characteristic detailing, such as the mustache and tensioning strap, these boots are a perfect blend of functionality and aesthetics. 

Unfortunately, one of the main drawbacks of these boots is their sizing. Customers have reported that they are too large, both in terms of length and upper foot height, often requiring half sizes down. This issue could be frustrating for buyers who expect a well-fitting pair of boots. Nonetheless, the comfort levels and quality of the material seem to mitigate this disadvantage to a certain extent, with users praising the overall fit and feel. 

These boots are often considered comfortable, with a roomy calf and high enough shaft to prevent pant dirt. However, one downside to note is that the buckles are not adjustable as they might be on other models like the Hunter Norris Field Boot. The top cap detail adds a touch of elegance and sophistication, with the signature logo enhancing its overall appeal. 

The rain boots are textured with a ridge tread, offering extra grip and traction. This is particularly helpful in wet and muddy conditions. Cleaning these boots, however, might require a bit of effort as wiping with a damp sponge seems to be the suggested method, which could be perceived as slightly inconvenient for some customers. 

Despite its minor flaws, this Hunter Original Tall Rain Boot is widely appreciated for its top-notched natural rubber construction, attractive design, and overall functionality. Customers who manage to find the right fit in size seem to be extremely satisfied with their purchase, considering the high rating of 4.7 out of 5 stars.
