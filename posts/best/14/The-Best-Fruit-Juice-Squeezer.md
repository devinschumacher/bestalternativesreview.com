### What types of fruit juice squeezers are available?

From manual presses to electric options, there's a fruit juice squeezer for every preference and budget. Manual squeezers range from simple lever designs to spiral presses, while electric models offer convenience with continuous squeezing capabilities and pulp separation. 

Consider how much countertop space you have, your juice volume needs, and whether you prefer controlling the squeezing process yourself or having it automated. 


### How do I choose the right capacity?

Capacity varies significantly between models, from under 100ml to over 1000ml in one batch. Small capacities are ideal for single servings or light use, while larger capacities are suitable for daily juicing or preparing for guests.

### Do I need any special equipment?

Most fruit juice squeezers come with essential accessories like measuring cups, pulp containers, and cleaning brushes. However, some models require additional purchases for features like juicing glasses or specialized attachments. 

Check your model's specifications to see what comes included and what you might need to buy separately to get the most out of your juicer. 


### How do I maintain the equipment?

Regular cleaning is crucial for keeping your juicer hygienic and functioning properly. Most parts can be washed by hand, while cutting blades and pressing mechanisms should be disassembled and cleaned thoroughly after each use. 

Refer to your manual for specific cleaning instructions and any recommended maintenance schedules to extend your juicer's lifespan.

Consider which materials are safest for storing and serving your freshly squeezed juice, and whether you need dishwasher-safe options for convenience. 


### How much maintenance is required?

Manual squeezers typically require less maintenance than electric models, which may need occasional filter cleaning and motor lubrication. Regular cleaning and proper storage protect both types of juicers from damage and ensure consistent performance. 

Follow manufacturer recommendations for specific maintenance requirements and how often you should perform routine checks on your juicer's major components.
