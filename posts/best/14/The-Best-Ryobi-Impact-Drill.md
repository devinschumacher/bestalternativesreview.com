## Buyer's Guide

Ryobi impact drills combine powerful torque with controlled impact action to handle tough drilling and driving tasks. When selecting a Ryobi impact drill, consider several key factors to find the right tool for your needs. 


### Power and Torque

Ryobi impact drills are available in various voltage ratings, with 18V and 20V being common choices. Higher voltage typically means greater power and torque. For standard drilling and driving tasks, a 18V model is suitable. Professional-grade work requiring heavy-duty drilling may benefit from a 20V tool. When measuring torque, prioritize drills that offer high torque at lower speeds for better control during difficult applications. 


### Impact Mechanism

Impact drills use a hammer mechanism to deliver impact energy, which multiplies the bit's torque. The effective range of impact force is crucial. A wider impact range (e. g. , 1-20) provides versatile performance across different drill bit sizes and materials. Look for drills with adjustable impact settings to match the task's requirements, offering both high-impact mode for tough materials and low-impact mode for precision work. 


### Size and Ergonomics

The drill's size affects both comfort and control. Comfortable grip zones, especially in the handle area, enhance usability during extended use. The drill should balance well in your hand, with the weight distributed evenly - typically between 1.5 to 2.5 pounds for most Ryobi models. Ergonomic features like a smooth grip surface and well-placed buttons reduce hand fatigue during prolonged use. 


### accessories and compatibility

Pay attention to the included accessories and the tool's compatibility with various bits and attachments. Essential accessories usually include a carrying case, additional drill bits, and a battery. The drill should accept interchangeable bits and accessories using standard sizes for compatibility with other Ryobi power tools. Check if the drill can accommodate different battery types (e. g. , NiCad, NiMH, lithium-ion) to future-proof your investment. 


## FAQ


### What makes a Ryobi impact drill different from a standard drill?

Ryobi impact drills deliver more torque than traditional drills through a specialized hammer mechanism that delivers short, explosive bursts of energy. This feature excels in driving large fasteners, expanding holes, and breaking through tough materials like concrete and metal. 

The impact action reduces bit wandering and binds, allowing for deeper hole drilling and greater bit lifespan compared to non-impact drills. This technology makes Ryobi impact drills particularly effective for professional and serious DIY projects requiring consistent power and control. 


### What's the difference between corded and cordless Ryobi impact drills?

Corded impact drills draw power directly from a wall outlet, providing unbounded runtime and consistent performance without the need for recharging. They're ideal for heavy-duty applications in well-ventilated spaces with reliable electrical access. 

Cordless drills use rechargeable batteries, offering the flexibility to work in tight spaces or outdoors. Ryobi's P550 18V lithium-ion battery pack, for example, delivers up to 45 minutes of run time on a single charge, with the ability to operate in sub-zero temperatures and maintain 75% capacity after 1,000 charge cycles. 


### How do I choose the right size impact drill bit?

The drill's maximum bit size determines what materials you can effectively penetrate. Starter sets often include bits ranging from 1/8" to 1/2", suitable for wood, plastic, and light metals. For more substantial materials like concrete or steel, opt for drills capable of handling 3/8" to 1" bits. 

Consider the bit's shank design (hex, straight, or tapered) to match your drill's bit retention system. Additionally, check for bit durability - high-quality drill bits feature precision-tapered shanks and hardened tips for consistent performance across various materials. 


### What maintenance should I perform on my Ryobi impact drill?

Regularly clean your drill's exterior with a dry cloth and store it in a dust-free environment. Check and tighten the bit clamping mechanism monthly, and replace worn or damaged bits promptly. For corded drills, unplug and inspect the cord for signs of damage before each use. 

Keep the battery components clean and dry, ensuring proper contact between the battery and charger. If your drill uses a belt-driven hammer mechanism, periodically check and adjust the belt tension to maintain optimal performance. 


### How do I properly store a Ryobi impact drill?

Store your drill in a dry, dust-free location when not in use. Use the included carrying case or stand to protect the tool from scratches and damage. Keep the drill's components organized - store spare bits, adapters, and batteries in a dedicated toolbox or organizer. 

For corded drills, ensure the power cord is properly coiled and stored away from sharp objects. The battery should be kept charged but not fully depleted, and discharged batteries should be stored in a cool place, ideally between 40-70°F (4-21°C). 


### What's the expected lifespan of a Ryobi impact drill?

With proper maintenance, a Ryobi impact drill typically lasts 5-7 years, though this can vary based on usage frequency and storage conditions. The drill's motor and internal components generally last 3-4 years with regular use before showing signs of wear. 

Common indicators of impending failure include reduced power, increased noise, and slower response times. To extend your drill's lifespan, maintain regular cleaning, store it properly, and replace any worn parts promptly.
