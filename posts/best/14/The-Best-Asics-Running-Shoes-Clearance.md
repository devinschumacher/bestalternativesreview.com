## Buyer's Guide

Winter marks the perfect time for deals on running shoes, with many brands offering reductions on their sporty inventory. Asics, known for their reliable footwear, frequently participates in clearance sales that knock considerable amounts off their regular prices. These sales present a great opportunity to upgrade your running gear without breaking the bank. Here's what you need to consider when selecting clearance Asics running shoes. 


### Size and Fit

Asics shoes come in a wide range of sizes and fits, from roomy to snug. Clearance items may not carry the full size spectrum available in their standard lineup, so double-check the size chart. Like any footwear purchase, ensure you try them on with your running socks to get the right fit - remember, your feet swell during exercise, so opt for a slightly roomier fit if possible.

### Shoe Type

Asics offers several models for different running styles and terrains. Gel-cushioned shoes excel for city running, while Gel-Kayano provides extra support for overpronators. PrimeCushion models combine comfort and performance, making them suitable for both casual and competitive runners. Consider what type of running you do most often to choose the right category. 


### Mileage and Usage

Asics shoes vary in durability based on their intended use. Gel-Cumulus models, designed for everyday running, typically offer more miles before needing replacement compared to speed-specific shoes like the Gel- Kayano Trainer. Check the condition of the shoes - look for signs of excessive wear on the outsole or midsole compression. Shoes with significant wear patterns or damaged materials may not hold up well through multiple runs.

### Value and Return Policy

During clearance sales, check if returns are accepted and understand any restocking fees. Clearance items often come with shorter return windows, so try them on before committing to a purchase. Consider the value offered - compare the sale price to the current MSRP and weigh it against any potential quality compromises.

### What makes Asics running shoes unique?

Asics specializes in responsive cushioning and structured support through their proprietary technology. Their running shoes combine springy foam with supportive structures in the midsole for both heel and forefoot landing styles. 

Their Gel technology provides excellent shock absorption while Bounce material offers a lively feel. Each model incorporates thoughtfully placed features like guidance lines and dual-density foam for optimal performance during your run. 


### How do I choose the right Asics running shoe?

Start by determining your foot type - neutral, pronated, or supinated - to select the appropriate level of support. Consider your running gait and preferred footwear characteristics, such as moisture-wicking, quick-drying, or structured support. 

Visit a specialty running store for a gait analysis and proper fitting, as your choice should maximize comfort and prevent injury while allowing personal preference to influence your selection.

### How long do Asics running shoes typically last?

Most high-quality running shoes last 300-500 miles with regular use, though exact lifespan depends on your weight, running style, and how often you wear them. Heavier runners or those who wear shoes daily may need to replace them more frequently. 

Check for signs of wear like visible midsole compression, excessive tread wear, or changes in the fit. Replace shoes whenever you notice these indicators to maintain performance and ensure proper support. 


### Are Asics running shoes worth the investment?

While premium Asics models carry higher price tags, their superior materials and engineering often justify the cost for serious runners. Quality shoes reduce injury risk, last longer due to their construction, and provide more comfort than less expensive options. 

Investing in a properly fitted pair of Asics tailored to your foot type and running style typically offers better value than multiple pairs of lower-cost shoes that don't suit your needs.

### Can I return or exchange Asics running shoes?

Most Asics retailers accept returns and exchanges for opened shoes within 30-90 days of purchase, depending on the store policy. Ensure you have the original receipt and packaging intact for easy processing. 

If you need to exchange or return shoes, contact the retailer first to understand their specific return policy. Most will arrange for you to ship the shoes back if you're not local to their store. 


### What's the best way to care for Asics running shoes?

Regularly clean your Asics shoes with a damp cloth to remove dirt and sweat. Let them air dry completely before wearing again, as moisture can damage the materials and reduce their lifespan. 

Consider using shoe trees or packing them with newspaper to maintain their shape when not in use. For maximum longevity, avoid leaving them in direct sunlight or storing them in a humid environment.
