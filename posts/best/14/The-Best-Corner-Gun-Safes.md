## Buyer's Guide

Corner gun safes efficiently utilize space by mounting in wall corners, offering both protection and organization for firearms. These safes combine security features with practical design elements to keep weapons secure while maintaining accessibility. 


### Size and Space Requirements

Measure your available wall space to determine the appropriate safe size. Corner safes typically range from 24 to 60 inches in height and 12 to 36 inches in depth. Consider the safe's overall width to ensure it fits snugly in the corner while allowing for proper ventilation and access.
