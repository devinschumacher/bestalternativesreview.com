## Buyer's Guide

King electric blankets combine warmth and convenience, but selecting the right one can be overwhelming. This guide helps you understand key features and considerations for finding your ideal electric blanket. 


### Temperature Control

Electric blankets with multiple heat settings or zones provide more flexibility. Some models include preset programs for different times of the night. Consider a blanket with precise temperature control and easy-to-read controls. 


### Blanket Construction

The heating elements should be embedded in a high-quality, durable fabric. Look for blankets with reinforced stitching and moisture-resistant materials to prevent shorts and improve longevity. 


### Power Consumption and Safety

Energy-efficient blankets with automatic shut-off features use less electricity and are safer. Check the power rating and ensure the blanket meets UL or ETL safety standards for your region. 


### Size and Fit

Measure your bed to ensure the blanket is the correct length and width. Consider extra-long models for couples or those who like to sleep with their arms extended. The blanket should cover you fully without bunching.
