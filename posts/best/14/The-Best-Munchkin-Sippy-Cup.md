Select a cup matching your child's development stage. Beginners need wide bases and easy-grip handles. As they grow, opt for wider mouths and spill-proof lids. 


### Spill-Proof Design

Look for cups with reliable locking mechanisms and airtight seals. Check if the lid clicks when closed properly, indicating a secure fit.

Premier materials include BPA-free plastic, glass, or durable silicone. Consider which is safest, easiest to clean, and most resistant to leaks.

Handle designs, spill-resistant bases, and reversible lids can make your child's sipping experience safer and more convenient. 


## FAQ

The Munchkin Sippy Cup is designed for babies and toddlers between 9 months to 3 years old. It features a spill-proof lid that starts open and closes as the cup is tilted, helping to prevent leakage during use.

### Are Munchkin Sippy Cups safe for hot liquids?

Munchkin Sippy Cups are designed for both hot and cold liquids. However, when using with hot liquids, always allow the cup to cool slightly before offering it to your child to prevent burns. 

Check the manufacturer's specific guidelines for temperature tolerance, as some cups may have temperature limits based on their material. 


### How long do Munchkin Sippy Cups last?

A standard Munchkin Sippy Cup will typically last 6-12 months with regular use, depending on how often it's used and how well it's maintained.
