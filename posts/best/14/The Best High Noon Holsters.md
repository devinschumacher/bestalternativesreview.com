### Retention Levels

Higher retention levels prevent the firearm from being unintentionally released but can affect draw speed. Consider your carry requirements: everyday carry may benefit from moderate retention, while duty or competition use might require faster draw times. 


### Body Configuration Compatibility

Ensure the holster's retention method matches your firearm's grip texture and size. Deep concealment holsters work well with full-size pistols, while shall pocket options may be more practical for compact or concealment carry. The holster's shape should complement your body's natural curve, particularly around the hip line.
