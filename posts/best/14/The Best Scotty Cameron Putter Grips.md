## Buyer's Guide

Scotty Cameron putter grips significantly impact your putting stroke and consistency. Understanding their unique features will help you select the right grip size and style for your technique. 


### Standard Versus Tapered Grips

Standard grips feature a consistent diameter throughout their length, while tapered grips narrow slightly at the bottom. Tapered grips (like the Scotty Cameron S300) may reduce handspin and promote a more controlled stroke, while standard grips offer a consistent feel throughout the putter. 


### Grip Sizes

Scotty Cameron offers three grip sizes: Standard (S), Extra Small (XS), and Small (S-Mini). XS and S-Mini provide reduced overlap for players with smaller hands or those transitioning from mallet putters. Standard grips work best for average-sized hands or those who prefer the feel of wider overlap. 


### Ultralight And Standard Weight Grips

Ultralight grips (like the Scotty Cameron S20) save approximately 13 grams of weight compared to standard grips, while still providing the same texture and surface area. Standard-weight grips maintain the traditional feel preferred by many players. For an innovative option, consider the S300 grip with its integrated weight system. 


### Selecting The Right Size And Style

Proper grip selection requires evaluating your putting technique and hand size. Tapered grips optimize stroke efficiency for most players, while different sizes accommodate various hand dimensions. Experiment with standard and ultralight options to determine which provides the most consistent feedback and control during your putting stroke. 


## FAQ


### What materials are the Scotty Cameron putter grips made from?

Scotty Cameron putter grips are available in three primary materials: E-Ray, E-Ray Ultra, and Soft Tact. E-Ray and E-Ray Ultra are both made from a proprietary rubber compound, while Soft Tact features a premium rubber construction with a distinctive dimpled surface for enhanced grip. 

The choice of material affects the grip's texture, durability, and moisture resistance. E-Ray and E-Ray Ultra offer a slightly tackier surface with better moisture resistance, making them ideal for various weather conditions. Soft Tact provides a softer feel with increased texture for improved grip security. 


### How do the Scotty Cameron grips differ in size?

Scotty Cameron grips come in standard, regular, and oversize versions to accommodate different hand sizes and putter designs. The standard grip measures 69mm, regular measures 71mm, and oversize measures 73mm. These measurements may vary slightly depending on the specific grip model. 

When selecting a grip size, consider the overall length of your putter and the feel you prefer when addressing the ball. Slightly oversizing the grip can provide more stability and confidence during your stroke, while the standard size maintains a traditional feel. 


### What is the recommended maintenance for Scotty Cameron grips?

Regular maintenance helps preserve the grip's texture and longevity. After each use, wipe the grip with a clean, slightly damp cloth to remove any grass or debris. For deeper cleaning, use a grip conditioner or golf-specific cleaner, following the manufacturer's instructions. 

Apply a thin, even layer of grip compound to maintain texture and prevent slipping. The frequency of maintenance depends on usage and environmental conditions. In humid or coastal environments, consider applying grip compound more frequently to maintain optimal grip security. 


### Are Scotty Cameron grips compatible with all putter designs?

Scotty Cameron grips are designed to fit most putter designs, but compatibility may vary slightly depending on the specific model and your grip style. The grip's length and thickness should match your putter's hosel depth and shaft diameter for proper fit. 

If you have a specialty putter design, such as an offset or blade model, it's advisable to check the grip's compatibility with your specific putter before purchase. Scotty Cameron offers detailed grip charts on their website to help with proper selection. 


### How long do Scotty Cameron grips typically last?

Scotty Cameron grips generally last between 18 to 36 months with regular use, depending on frequency of play, environmental conditions, and maintenance practices. Professional players with daily practice sessions may need to replace their grips more frequently. 

Regular maintenance and proper application of grip compound can significantly extend the life of the grips. Pay attention to changes in grip texture or tackiness, as these are indicators that it's time to replace the grips. 


### What is the return policy for Scotty Cameron grips?

Scotty Cameron offers a generous return policy for their grips. Unused grips can typically be returned within 30 days of purchase for a full refund. The grips must be in their original packaging and unopened. 

For opened grips or those showing signs of wear, the policy varies by retailer. Some may still accept returns for unused grips, while others may require the grips to be in new condition. Always check with your retailer's specific return policy before sending the grips back.
