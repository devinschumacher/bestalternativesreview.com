## Buyer's Guide

White tea perfume combines the subtle complexity of fine fragrances with the natural properties of white tea, creating a sophisticated scent profile that appeals to both casual and discerning perfume enthusiasts. When selecting a white tea perfume, consider the following key factors to find a scent that resonates with your personal style and preferences. 


### Key Notes and Scent Profiles

White tea perfumes typically feature top notes of fresh, green tea, along with floral accords that add depth and complexity. The heart notes often include jasmine, rose, or gardenia, while the base notes may incorporate woods, musk, or vanilla for lasting power. Understanding these basic scent components can help you select a fragrance that matches your favorite white tea blends. 


### Sillage and Longevity

Sillage refers to the strength and distance at which a fragrance is detectable, while longevity indicates how long the scent lasts on the skin. High-quality white tea perfumes usually offer moderate sillage and good longevity, lasting 3-6 hours with a noticeable presence. Consider your daily activities and preferences when balancing these attributes. 


### Concentrations and Application Methods

White tea perfumes are typically available in concentrations ranging from Eau de Cologne (10-15% perfume) to Parfum (20-30% perfume).

Apply the fragrance to pulse points like the wrist, neck, and behind the ears for optimal results. 


### Customization and Matching

Many perfumers offer customization services that allow you to blend white tea notes with complementary scents. This personalized approach can help you create a unique fragrance that complements your natural scent while incorporating your favorite tea elements. When matching a white tea perfume, consider factors like your skin tone, hair color, and personal style to achieve the best results.
