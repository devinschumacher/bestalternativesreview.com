## Buyer's Guide

A Nutribullet juicer combines blending and juicing in one compact appliance, making it a convenient choice for quick breakfasts and smoothies. Understanding the key features and considerations will help you select the right model for your needs. 


### Power and Performance

Standard Nutribullet models offer 250 watts of power, suitable for most fruits and vegetables. For harder ingredients like frozen fruits or tougher vegetables, consider models with 600 watts or more. Higher wattage allows for smoother blending and faster processing times. 


### Capacity and Portion Control

Cups range from 12 to 24 ounces in most models. Evaluate your typical serving size and daily usage to choose an appropriate capacity. Consider a model with multiple cups if you want to blend larger batches or make separate servings. 


### Blade Quality and Durability

Look for models with stainless steel blades, as they provide the sharpest cutting edge and resist corrosion. The number of blades can affect performance - dual-blade systems are common, while some premium models feature three blades for smoother results. 


### Cleanability and Maintenance

Most Nutribullet components are dishwasher safe, which simplifies cleaning. However, certain parts like the blending container and lid require hand washing to prevent damage. Evaluate the disassembly process to ensure all parts can be thoroughly cleaned and properly dried. 


## FAQ


### What is a Nutribullet Juicer?

The Nutribullet is a small kitchen appliance that makes fresh juices and smoothies. It consists of a motorized base, blending cups with interchangeable lids, and various accessories for pureeing foods.

### What types of containers does the Nutribullet come with?

Each blender comes with three travel-friendly 12-ounce cups featuring interchangeable lids – one with a straw for blending on-the-go, one with a spill-proof lid, and one with a standard lid. 

You can also purchase additional cups and lids separately, including 16-ounce cups for larger servings and 32-ounce blending containers for making smoothies. 


### What materials are the Nutribullet cups made from?

Most Nutribullet cups are constructed from BPA-free, dishwasher-safe Tritan material that's microwave-safe and durable enough for daily use. 

For users who prefer glass, the company offers a 32-ounce blending container made from borosilicate glass, featuring triple-wall construction for durability. 


### Are Nutribullet cups dishwasher safe?

Yes, all Nutribullet cups and lids are dishwasher safe, making it convenient to clean your blending containers after use. 

If you prefer hand washing, the cups and most lids are also top-rack dishwasher safe, while some specialized lids (like the straw lid) should be hand washed for best results. 


### What accessories come with a Nutribullet?

Every Nutribullet comes with three travel cups and lids, blending accessories like a dasher and tamper, and a recipe book featuring dozens of drink recipes. 

Additional accessories available for purchase include a 32-ounce glass blending container, ice cream scoops, and replacement parts for cups and lids. 


### How should I clean my Nutribullet?

To clean your Nutribullet, remove the motor base and all blending parts, then hand wash them with dish soap and a soft brush. Rinse thoroughly and air dry before reassembling. 

For the motor base, wipe it down with a soft cloth and mild soap as needed. Always ensure both the motor base and blending cups are completely dry before use.
