## FAQ

### What is a light ball?

A light ball is a decorative sphere that glows with an illuminated display. They come in various shapes, sizes, and light effects, making them popular for home decoration and outdoor events. 

These balls often feature LED technology for energy efficiency and can be powered by batteries or plugged into an electrical outlet. Some models change colors or have spinning mechanisms to enhance their visual appeal. 


### What makes light balls different from regular LED lights?

Light balls incorporate LED technology but present it in a spherical form with specialized decorative elements. While regular LED lights can be linear or have simple shapes, light balls combine illumination with physical design features like transparent or translucent materials. 

They also often include additional elements such as color-changing capabilities, spinning mechanisms, or unique patterns that regular LED lights might not have.

### Are light balls good for outdoor use?

Yes, many light balls are designed for outdoor use. They typically feature waterproof or water-resistant construction and can be safely used in outdoor settings like gardens, patios, or events. 

Look for products with specific outdoor ratings, such as IP65 or higher, which indicate resistance to moisture and dust. Always ensure the power source is appropriate for the environment and consider weatherproofing adaptors if needed. 


### How long do light balls last?

Light balls can last for several years with proper care. The LED bulbs typically have a lifespan of 50,000 hours, while the decorative elements usually maintain their integrity for 3-5 years of regular use. 

Regular maintenance is crucial for longevity. Check for loose connections, clean the surface regularly, and replace batteries as needed. Store the light ball properly when not in use to protect it from environmental damage.

### What should I consider when buying a light ball?

Choose a light ball that matches your intended use, whether for indoor or outdoor decoration. Consider factors like brightness, color options, and any special features you want, such as motion sensing or color-changing effects. 

Check the power requirements and ensure the ball can be safely operated in your chosen environment. Read reviews to compare compatibility with your power source and ensure the ball meets your aesthetic preferences. 


### How do I maintain a light ball?

Maintain your light ball by checking connections and cleaning the surface regularly. Use a soft cloth and mild cleaner if needed, avoiding harsh chemicals that could damage the materials. 

Store the light ball in a dry place when not in use. If using outdoors, remove the power source before storing to prevent damage from unexpected weather conditions.
