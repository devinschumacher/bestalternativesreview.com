Standard heights range from 24 to 48 inches, with depths typically between 18 and 24 inches. Widths usually fall between 12 and 24 inches per section, with multi-section cabinets combining these measurements. 

Ensure the cabinet's overall dimensions fit your available space, considering both height and clearance for file removal. The cabinet's depth should allow for complete file extraction without obstruction.

Storage capacity varies based on folder size and organization system. Consider vertical space usage, as some cabinets optimize storage through slanted or tiered designs. 


### What features improve desk filing cabinet organization?

Adjustable shelving, dividers, and color-coding systems enhance organization. Some models feature vertical file compartments or open shelves for smaller items. 

Rotating closures, door organizers, and dual-locking mechanisms prevent file spillage and unauthorized access. Premium options include LED lighting, climate control, and magnetic door seals.
