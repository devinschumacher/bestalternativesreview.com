## FAQ


### What is a Popsocket car mount?

A Popsocket car mount attaches to your smartphone or tablet via a clip or magnetic mount, while its flexible prongs secure to your vehicle's dashboard or console. This combination creates a stable, multi-angle viewing position for your device while driving. 

Popular variants include clips that attach with suction cups or magnetic mounts that work on both metal and non-metal surfaces. The mount's versatility allows you to view maps, videos, or GPS directions while maintaining both hands on the steering wheel. 


### Is the Popsocket car mount compatible with my phone?
