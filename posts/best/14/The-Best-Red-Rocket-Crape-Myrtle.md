## FAQ


### What makes 'Red Rocket' crape myrtle unique?

'Red Rocket' crape myrtle stands out due to its rapid growth rate and striking red flowers that appear before the leaves. This variety typically grows 15-20 feet tall with a 12-15 foot spread, making it suitable for large landscapes but adaptable enough for smaller spaces with proper pruning. 

Its cold hardiness to USDA zone 7 and ability to thrive in various soil types make it a versatile addition to both residential and commercial landscapes. The dark red new growth and red flower clusters provide immediate visual impact when planted. 


### How fast does 'Red Rocket' crape myrtle grow?

Known for its rapid growth, 'Red Rocket' crape myrtle can add 2-3 feet of height annually under optimal conditions. This quick growth rate allows it to reach its mature height of 15-20 feet in about 5-7 years, making it a practical choice for new landscapes or quickly filling in bare spots. 

While growth rate can vary based on climate, soil quality, and care, regular watering and proper nutrition will help maintain its natural growth speed. Mature width usually stabilizes at 12-15 feet after several growing seasons. 


### What are the pruning requirements for 'Red Rocket' crape myrtle?

To maintain its shape and promote healthy growth, 'Red Rocket' crape myrtle should be pruned immediately after flowering in early spring. Removing up to one-third of the oldest branches helps maintain the tree's vigor and prevents overcrowding of the canopy. 

Regularly remove crossing or rubbing branches, thinning out the center to allow good air circulation. Proper pruning techniques ensure the tree remains structurally sound while maintaining its natural vase shape. 


### How cold hardy is 'Red Rocket' crape myrtle?

'Red Rocket' crape myrtle is cold hardy to USDA zone 7, making it suitable for most of the United States with proper winter protection in the coldest regions. In warmer climates, it performs exceptionally well without additional heating requirements. 

Established plants in zones 7-9 typically require no winter protection. In cooler regions, mulching around the base and wrapping the trunk can help prevent winter damage. Container-grown specimens may need to be moved to a sheltered area. 


### What are the light requirements for 'Red Rocket' crape myrtle?

To produce its best flowering displays, 'Red Rocket' crape myrtle needs full sun exposure of at least 6-8 hours per day. While it can tolerate some afternoon shade in very hot climates, reduced flowering may occur in partially shaded locations. 

During establishment (first 2-3 years), consistent sun helps the young tree develop a strong root system and promotes healthier growth. Mature trees with consistent sun will have more vibrant flower displays and better overall health. 


### What soil requirements should be considered for 'Red Rocket' crape myrtle?

While adaptable to various soil types, 'Red Rocket' crape myrtle performs best in well-draining soil with a pH between 5.5 and 7.0. Soils that retain excessive moisture can lead to root rot and other health issues. 

To prepare planting sites, amend heavy clay soils with organic matter to improve drainage. Sandy soils may require addition of organic materials to increase water retention. Regular application of compost enhances overall soil quality and nutrient availability.
