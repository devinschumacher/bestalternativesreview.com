When Good American decided to enter the trench coat market, they brought their signature blend of eco-friendly materials and plus-size inclusivity. Unfortunately, their heavy denim creation didn't quite live up to expectations, with one reviewer comparing the coat's weight to a 5-pound anchor and criticizing its stiff, unwieldy fabric. Despite the disappointing feedback, the brand continues to push boundaries by offering an open-front style with practical side pockets and that signature tie closure detail.

## Buyer's Guide

Denim trench coats combine the practicality of military-inspired design with the casual versatility of jeans material. These versatile outerwear pieces offer both style and functionality, making them a popular choice for various occasions. When selecting a denim trench coat, consider factors like cut, denim quality, and additional features to find the right balance of style and performance. 


### Denim Quality and Construction

Higher-quality denim typically means stronger stitching and better durability. Look for coats made from 12-ounce or heavier denim, which provides better structure and wear resistance. The fabric should feel sturdy to the touch and maintain its shape over time. Premium coats often feature reinforced stitching at stress points and premium hardware like solid metal buttons and brass zippers.

### Cut and Fit

Denim trench coats come in various cuts, from slim-fitting to generously roomy styles. Consider your body type and intended use when selecting a fit. Slimmer cuts are ideal for dressy occasions, while roomier styles offer more freedom of movement. Pay attention to shoulder width and arm length when trying on different sizes to ensure a comfortable, flattering fit. 


### Additional Features

Many modern denim trench coats incorporate practical enhancements beyond traditional styling. Look for details like multiple pockets (both interior and exterior), adjustable cuffs, and reinforced knee panels for increased durability. YKK zippers and other quality closures can also improve both functionality and longevity of the coat.

### Care and Maintenance

Denim requires regular maintenance to maintain its appearance and extend its lifespan. Always wash new coats before wearing to remove manufacturing residue. Machine wash with similar colors, using cold water and mild detergent. Avoid using bleach or fabric softeners, which can damage the denim. Hanging the coat to dry prevents stretching and helps maintain its shape.

### What makes a denim trench coat different from a regular trench coat?

Denim trench coats combine the classic silhouette of a traditional trench with the durability and versatility of denim. While regular trench coats are typically made from gabardine or cotton, denim versions offer a more casual, laid-back look that pairs well with both casual and smart-casual outfits. 

The most significant differences lie in the material and construction. Denim trenches feature water-resistant canvas or cotton canvas shells, while regular trenches use heavier, more waterproof fabrics. The manufacturing process also varies, with denim coats often incorporating thicker stitching and reinforced seams for added durability. 


### Are denim trench coats suitable for all weather conditions?

Denim trench coats excel in cool, transitional weather, providing adequate protection from the elements while remaining breathable. They're particularly effective in light rain or drizzle, but may not perform as well in heavy downpours without additional water-resistant treatments. 

Most denim trenches include water-resistant coatings or treatments that enhance their weatherproofing. However, their primary design focuses on comfort and style rather than extreme weather protection. For harsher conditions, consider models with built-in water-resistance or invest in a separate raincoat.

### How do I care for a denim trench coat?

Care requirements for denim trenches vary by manufacturer, but most can be spot-cleaned using mild soap and water. Avoid machine washing, as it may damage the fabric or cause color fading. Instead, hand wash or dry clean the coat as recommended by the manufacturer. 

Avoid hanging denim trench coats when they're damp, as this can stretch the fabric and cause uneven shaping. Instead, lay the coat flat to air dry or hang it on a padded hanger to prevent distortion. Regularly inspect the buttons and stitching for wear and replace any loose or damaged components promptly. 


### What should I look for when buying a denim trench coat?

Key considerations include the coat's water resistance, durability of the material, and fit. Look for detailed stitching around the seams and reinforced areas like the elbows and knees. The water resistance should be sufficient for occasional, light rain, while the material should feel sturdy and well-constructed. 

Size is crucial when selecting a denim trench coat. These coats often run small, so consider ordering one size larger than your usual shirt size. Additionally, check the sizing chart provided by the manufacturer to ensure proper fit.

### Can I wear a denim trench coat in winter?

Denim trenches work well as an outer layer in mild winter conditions. Their water-resistant properties make them suitable for light rain or snowfall, but they might not provide enough insulation for extremely cold weather. Many people pair them with a waterproof shell jacket for additional protection in winter climates. 

Style-wise, the casual look of a denim trench pairs well with winter accessories like hats, scarfs, and gloves. Consider opting for darker washes or black versions if you plan to wear them for fall or winter events where a more formal appearance is expected. 


### What are the best brands for denim trench coats?

Popular brands known for their denim trench coats include Levi's, Indigo, and H&M's &CarrÃ© line. These brands offer a range of styles and price points, from classic single-breasted options to modern double-breasted designs. Each brand has its own strengths, so consider factors like water resistance, durability, and fit when selecting a quality pair. 

For vintage-inspired options, consider brands like Original Denim Company or True Religion, which specialize in premium denim with a focus on traditional craftsmanship. These brands often produce heavier, more weather-resistant versions of the classic denim trench coat.
