### Capacity and Brew Size

Capacity varies between models - the K-2500 boasts a 24-cup reservoir, while the K-2800 features a 30-cup option. Consider how much coffee you typically brew in one session to choose the right size for you. These makers also offer programmable brew sizes ranging from 4 to 12 ounces, perfect for single or double servings.
