## Buyer's Guide


### Thickness and Durability

The thickness determines the paper's gloss level and flexibility. Opt for thicker options (0.5mm or more) for lasting wallcoverings, while thinner varieties (0.3mm) work well for craft projects and scrapbooking. 


### Material Quality and Appearance

Premium contact paper features consistent color saturation and robust adhesive properties. Higher-quality sheets resist sagging and warping, maintaining their pristine appearance. 


### Peeling and Application Ease

Evaluation of peelable backing and release papers ensures smooth application. Look for materials with easily removable backing that prevents residue and bubble formation during installation. 


### Size and Roll Features

Standard roll sizes range from 50 to 100 square feet. Consider purchase in larger quantities for extensive projects, and choose products with protective covers to maintain freshness. 


## FAQ


### What is decorative contact paper?

Decorative contact paper is a thin, flexible sheet material that can be applied to surfaces to create a fresh, updated look. Unlike traditional wallpaper, it's easier to install and remove, making it ideal for renters or those who want temporary wall decor. 

These papers come in various finishes - from shiny gloss to matte - and designs ranging from plain white to intricate patterns and photos. They're popular for covering kitchen backsplashes, refrigerator doors, and adding a personal touch to office walls. 


### What surfaces can I use decorative contact paper on?

Decorative contact paper works best on smooth, flat surfaces like wood, drywall, glass, and metal. It's particularly useful for covering cracks, hiding imperfections, or adding color to small spaces. 

Avoid using it on absorbent surfaces like ceramic tile or untreated wood, as they may cause the paper to lift or peel. Also, check the adhesive's compatibility with your surface before application. 


### How hard is it to remove decorative contact paper?

Decorative contact paper is designed to be removed without damaging the underlying surface. Most papers come with an easy-to-remove backing sheet, making them reusable or portable. 

While the process can vary based on the paper's quality and how long it's been installed, proper removal typically takes about an hour per roll. Always work from the top down and use a gentle peel-and-stick motion to prevent the paper from tearing or sticking to itself. 


### What if the paper bubbles or lifts during installation?

If bubbles or lifting occur during installation, it usually means air or moisture is trapped underneath the paper. Gently press the affected area with a credit card or similar flat tool to help the paper adhere properly. 

Allow the paper to dry completely before attempting to smooth out any remaining bubbles. Using too much moisture or applying pressure too quickly can cause the paper to tear, so work slowly and carefully. 


### How long does decorative contact paper last?

Decorative contact paper typically lasts between 1 to 3 years with proper care, depending on its quality and the environmental conditions. Factors like exposure to direct sunlight, moisture, and high humidity can affect its longevity. 

For the best results, apply the paper away from moisture sources (like kitchen sinks) and avoid areas with direct sunlight. With proper placement and care, high-quality papers can maintain their appearance for several years. 


### Can I use decorative contact paper outdoors?

Decorative contact papers intended for indoor use may not perform well in outdoor settings due to exposure to elements like rain, sun, and wind. Outdoors, these papers are more likely to peel, bubble, or fade. 

If you need weather-resistant options, consider outdoor-rated vinyls or specially formulated decorative materials designed for exterior surfaces.
