## FAQ


### What is the notes profile of Glam Jasmine?

Glam Jasmine features top notes of pink grapefruit and green apple, middle notes of jasmine and rose, and a base of vanilla and musk. The scent combines fruity freshness with floral complexity, giving it both daytime and evening appeal. 

The perfume has an average lifespan of 4-6 hours on the skin, with noticeable sillage (3-5 feet). It's suitable for all skin types and has a moderate strength, making it neither too overwhelming nor too subtle. 


### How does Glam Jasmine compare to other Michael Kors fragrances?

Compared to Michael Kors' Sport collection, Glam Jasmine offers a more sophisticated floral profile. Unlike the sporty, aquatic notes of Versace's Poison, this scent presents a softer take on jasmine with added rose accents. 

Set between Michael Kors' Original scent and its newer Black edition, Glam Jasmine strikes a balance with its fresh yet warm fragrance. It complements both light and deeper skin tones equally well. 


### What are the key selling points of Glam Jasmine?

The core appeal of Glam Jasmine lies in its balanced composition that harmonizes sweet jasmine with subtle rose notes. The addition of pink grapefruit and green apple creates a modern twist on traditional floral scents. 

The fragrance also benefits from Michael Kors' signature packaging, which combines elegant simplicity with distinctive branding, making it visually appealing both on and off the wrist. 


### What makes Glam Jasmine different from cheaper alternatives?

The main differentiator is the quality of ingredients and the authentic Michael Kors scent profile. Counterfeit versions often miss these details, leading to shorter-lasting scents that lack the distinctive notes of genuine Michael Kors perfume. 

Premium versions typically offer superior longevity and intensity, with clear Michael Kors branding and proper packaging. Always source from authorized retailers to ensure authenticity and quality. 


### Can Glam Jasmine be worn daily?

The versatile scent makes it suitable for daily wear in most settings. The fresh top notes and warm base appeal to both daytime and evening occasions. However, individuals with extremely sensitive skin might want to spot-test it first. 

It pairs well with casual to professional attire, making it a practical choice for both personal use and gifting. The moderate strength allows for layering with other fragrances if desired. 


### What should I consider when choosing between Glam Jasmine and other Michael Kors fragrances?

Consider your personal scent preferences. If you favor sporty, aquatic notes, Versace Poison might suit you better. For something more traditional yet modern, Glam Jasmine offers a balanced approach with its jasmine-rose combination. 

Think about the occasions you'll wear it. The fresh top notes work well for daytime, while the warm base notes add sophistication for evening. The fragrance's longevity and sillage can also influence your choice based on how often you'd like the scent to last.
