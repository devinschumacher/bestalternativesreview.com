### Compatibility and Preparation

The paint set should include appropriate mediums for mixing and thinning. Consider whether the set provides separate containers for mixing or if you need to supply your own. Understanding proper preparation techniques ensures your paints perform optimally.

## FAQ


### What is the Citadel Paint Set and what makes it unique?

The Citadel Paint Set is a professional-quality paint line specifically designed for hobbyists and miniature painters. It features pre-mixed acrylic paints that offer vibrant colors and excellent blending properties. The set includes both metallic and regular paints, providing artists with the versatility needed for detailed miniature painting. 

The paints are known for their longevity and water resistance, making them ideal for both acrylic painting and primer application. Each set comes with comprehensive color charts and mixing guides to help artists achieve the desired effects. 


### How does the color range compare to other hobby paint sets?

The Citadel color range is considered one of the most extensive available for hobby use, offering 48 primary colors that can be mixed to create thousands of additional shades. This depth of color allows for highly detailed and realistic miniature painting. 

Compared to other popular hobby paint sets, the Citadel collection provides better color consistency and wider saturation, though it typically requires more mixing for intermediate shades. 


### Are the paints suitable for both metal and plastic models?

Yes, the Citadel paints are formulated to work well on both metal and plastic surfaces. They provide excellent adhesion and drying properties, making them versatile for various miniature painting applications. 

For metal models, the paints adhere exceptionally well through primer application, while for plastic models, they can be used directly as needed. This versatility makes them a practical choice for both new and experienced hobbyists. 


### How do the metallic paints perform compared to standard colors?

Citadel's metallic paints offer superior coverage and luster compared to many standard hobby paints. They provide a professional-looking finish that can significantly enhance the visual appeal of miniatures. 

These paints contain real metal powder, which gives them their distinctive quality. While they can be challenging to work with due to their opacity, the results are worth the effort for serious hobbyists. 


### What is the drying time like for these paints?

Citadel paints typically dry to the touch in 2-3 hours but may take 24 hours to fully cure, especially when applied in multiple layers. The drying process can be accelerated with fan assistance or by working in a well-ventilated area. 

These times may vary depending on environmental conditions and the specific paint color used. Some metallic paints may require longer drying times due to their thicker consistency. 


### Are these paints compatible with other hobby products?

Yes, the Citadel paints are compatible with most hobby products used by modelers. They work well with other hobby paints when used with appropriate blending techniques, and the company's own products, such as its metal and primer lines, are formulated to work together seamlessly. 

However, it's important to note that while compatibility is good, some artists prefer to use their own brand for all products to maintain consistency. The paints are known to work well with both water-based and solvent-based systems.
