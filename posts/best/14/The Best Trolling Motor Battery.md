## Buyer's Guide

Trolling motor batteries power the propulsion systems that enable quiet, efficient travel on water. Understanding the key aspects of these batteries will help you select the right power source for your boat or watercraft. 


### Capacity and Runtime

Battery capacity is measured in ampere-hours (Ah), indicating how long the battery can supply current before needing recharging. For trolling motors, a common capacity range is 10-20 Ah. Multiply the capacity by the motor's current draw to estimate runtime under load. Consider a higher capacity for longer trips or against stronger currents. 


### Voltage Requirements

Trolling motors typically operate at 6 or 12 volts, corresponding to the battery voltage. Ensure the battery matches your motor's voltage requirements. Higher voltage systems may offer better performance in cold weather but require more complex electrical setups. 


### Rechargeability and Maintenance

Most trolling motor batteries are rechargeable, with sealed lead-acid (SLA) being the most common type. These batteries require regular maintenance, including checking fluid levels and keeping connections clean. Lithium-ion batteries offer the advantage of lower maintenance but come with a higher initial cost. 


### Environmental Factors

Water and temperature significantly impact battery performance and lifespan. Marine-grade batteries are specifically designed to handle moisture and extreme temperatures. Store batteries in dry conditions when not in use, and consider a battery tender for maintaining charge levels between fishing trips. 


## FAQ


### What is a trolling motor battery?

A trolling motor battery powers the motor that propels electric boats at low speeds, often used for fishing or leisure. They're designed for long-term, low-power applications, unlike batteries optimized for bursts of high power. 

Trolling motor batteries typically use lead-acid or lithium chemistry, with capacities ranging from 20 to 120 amp-hours. The specific type and capacity depend on the motor's power requirements and the boat's size. 


### How long does a trolling motor battery last?

With proper maintenance, lead-acid trolling motor batteries last 3-5 years, while lithium batteries can last 5-7 years. Expect this range if you maintain the battery and follow the manufacturer's care instructions. 

Life expectancy decreases with age, environmental factors like temperature, and how frequently you use the battery. Regular maintenance and monitoring can help extend the battery's lifespan. 


### What's the difference between marine and automotive batteries?

Marine batteries, including trolling motor batteries, have thicker plates and specialized case designs to prevent water ingress and corrosion. They're built to cycle through a range of discharge levels repeatedly. 

Automotive batteries, on the other hand, are optimized for starting engines with bursts of high power. They're not designed for deep cycling or the long-term discharge cycles typical in marine applications. 


### How deep can you discharge a trolling motor battery?

Safe practice recommends not discharging trolling motor batteries below 50% of their capacity, though they may survive deeper discharges. Going below 20% repeatedly significantly reduces battery life and performance. 

For comparison, an automotive battery is generally discharged to 20-30% before needing recharge, while a trolling motor battery's design allows for safer, more frequent deep discharges within its operating range. 


### What are the benefits of lithium trolling motor batteries?

Lithium batteries offer higher energy density, which means they provide more power in a smaller, lighter package compared to lead-acid batteries. This can enable longer runtime and reduced weight in your boat. 

They also have faster charging capabilities, require less maintenance, and don't degrade as quickly as lead-acid batteries over time. However, they're more expensive upfront and require specific charging equipment. 


### How do I maintain my trolling motor battery?

Proper maintenance extends battery life and ensures reliable performance. Store your battery in a clean, dry environment (fully charged) when not in use, and charge it monthly for optimal performance if it's partially discharged. 

Keep the battery terminals clean and check fluid levels in non-sealed lead-acid batteries. For lithium batteries, monitor the charge level and avoid letting it fall below 20% during use, as recommended by the manufacturer.
