## Buyer's Guide

Blanket baskets serve as practical storage solutions for keeping blankets, throws, and other textiles organized and accessible. These versatile containers come in various styles and sizes, making them suitable for different rooms and preferences. 


### Size and Shape Considerations

The dimensions of a blanket basket should match the space available while providing sufficient capacity. Common shapes include rectangular, cylindrical, and oval, each offering different footprint options for your room's layout. 

Measure the intended storage area before selecting a basket to ensure it fits comfortably within the available space without being too bulky. 

![Blanket-Basket-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Blanket-Basket-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### MATERIAL AND DURABILITY

Popular materials for blanket baskets include woven fabrics, wicker, bamboo, and plastic. Woven baskets offer excellent breathability and moisture resistance, while wicker and bamboo provide a natural aesthetic. Plastic options are durable and weather-resistant but may not match the warmth of organic materials. 

Look for baskets with sturdy construction, such as woven baskets with tight stitching or plastic containers with reinforced corners. The base should feel solid when lifted to prevent tipping. 


### STYLING ELEMENTS

Blanket baskets range from rustic to contemporary designs, allowing you to find one that complements your existing decor. Natural materials often work well with outdoor spaces or rustic interiors, while sleek plastic baskets can fit modern apartments. 

Consider the basket's color and texture in relation to your room's color scheme and existing furniture. Multi-tonal baskets can add visual interest, while solid-colored options offer a neutral backdrop for your blankets. 

![Blanket-Basket-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Blanket-Basket-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### MULTI-PURPOSE APPLICATIONS

Beyond storing blankets, these baskets can double as seat cushions, planters, or decorative elements. Choose a design with open sides for better ventilation, which is beneficial if you convert it into a planter. 

Consider the basket's height when selecting its location. Lower baskets work well under beds or as ottomans, while taller baskets can stand alone in corners or as room dividers. 


## FAQ

![Blanket-Basket-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Blanket-Basket-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What is a blanket basket?

A blanket basket is a storage solution specifically designed to keep blankets, throws, and other bulky bedding items organized and accessible. These baskets typically feature sturdy construction with lid options for protecting contents from dust and light. 

Common materials include woven baskets, plastic containers with lids, and wire baskets, each offering different levels of durability and aesthetic appeal for various room styles. 


### How do I choose the right size blanket basket?

Select a basket that is slightly larger than the combined size of your blanket and any storage add-ons like pillows or storage cubes. This ensures easy maneuverability when removing items. 

Consider the space available in your room and the number of blankets you need to store, choosing a size that fits well under beds, in closets, or as a standalone piece of furniture. 

![Blanket-Basket-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Blanket-Basket-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What features should I look for in a quality blanket basket?

Choose a basket with a secure lid if you want to prevent dust buildup and maintain the appearance of your blankets. Durable materials like solid wood or heavy-duty plastic are ideal for regular use. 

Storage baskets with a flat bottom and a consistent shape stack more efficiently and maintain their stability when placed on top of each other in multi-level storage solutions. 


### How should I clean a blanket basket?

Regular vacuuming or dusting with a dry cloth keeps the exterior of the basket clean and extends its lifespan. For plastic or synthetic baskets, you can also wipe down the inside with a damp cloth occasionally. 

Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials that might damage the surface or warp the material. Replace or repair any worn-out handles or lids promptly to maintain safety and functionality.

### What’s the best way to store blankets in a basket?

 Fold or roll blankets neatly before placing them in the basket to maximize space and protect them from dust and crushing. Consider using mesh bowls or bins for small items like washcloths or facecloths to keep the basket organized. 

If your basket has a lid, open it completely when storing and retrieving items to prevent moisture buildup, especially in humid environments or during seasonal changes. 


### Can I mix and match blanket baskets with different patterns and colors?

Solid-colored baskets blend seamlessly with most room decors and suit both casual and formal spaces. They're perfect for storing basic bedding that matches existing furniture. 

If you're using patterned blankets, opt for baskets with a matching color scheme or complementary neutral tones. Mixing baskets can create visual interest, but keep the number to a minimum to maintain a cohesive look.
