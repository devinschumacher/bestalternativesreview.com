## FAQ


### What is a scope camera?

A scope camera, or surveillance camera, is a viewing device that captures images or video footage of an area under surveillance. These cameras can be standalone devices or part of a larger security system. 

They are commonly used for monitoring homes, businesses, and public spaces to deter criminal activity and provide evidence in case of incidents. 


### How does a scope camera work?

### What are the different types of scope cameras?

Common types include dome cameras, bullet cameras, PTZ (pan-tilt-zoom) cameras, and fixed cameras. Each design offers different mounting flexibility and feature sets appropriate for various installation needs. 

Wireless cameras use either Wi-Fi or dedicated radio frequencies for video transmission, while wired cameras require physical connection to monitoring equipment. 


### How do I choose the right scope camera?

Essential features include resolution, night vision capabilities, and video stabilization. Consider additional features like motion detection, audio recording, and weather resistance based on your specific needs.
