## Buyer's Guide

A queen weighted blanket combines deep pressure stimulation with warming capabilities to promote relaxation and better sleep. Understanding key features helps ensure the blanket meets your comfort and therapeutic needs. 


### Weight Options

Standard queen blankets range from 15 to 30 pounds. Lighter blankets may help with relaxation and anxiety, while heavier ones provide deeper pressure stimulation for sleep disorders. Consider your therapeutic goals and ensure the weight feels supportive but not overwhelming. 


### Filling Materials

Common materials include glass beads, buckwheat hulls, or cashmere. Glass beads offer uniform weight distribution and are machine washable. Buckwheat hulls provide excellent pressure points but require regular fluffing. Cashmere delivers a softer feel but is more expensive and less commonly available. 


### Comfort Features

Consider designs with dual sides or reversible fabrics. Some blankets feature compression panels or asymmetrical weighting for targeted pressure application. Look for options with machine washable covers and adjustable straps to secure the blanket effectively. 


### Maintenance and Cleaning

Larger blankets require more maintenance. Choose materials that allow machine washing at least 1-2 times per season. Pay attention to cleaning instructions for the cover versus the weighted material. Consider blankets with removable, washable covers for easier maintenance. 


## FAQ


### What is a weighted blanket?

Weighted blankets are sleeping aids that contain glass or plastic beads encased in fabric. They provide deep pressure stimulation, which helps regulate the nervous system and can improve sleep quality for people with anxiety, ADHD, or autism. 

Queen-sized blankets typically weigh between 25 to 35 pounds, offering a larger surface area for full-body relaxation compared to twin or twin XL options. 


### How much should a queen weighted blanket weigh?

The ideal weight varies by individual, but a general guideline is to choose a blanket that's 10% of your body weight. For most adults, this translates to a 25 to 35-pound blanket, with 30 pounds being a common recommendation. 

Heavier individuals may prefer 40 pounds or more, while lighter individuals might find relief with 20 pounds. Always choose a weight that feels comfortable and allows for unrestricted movement during sleep. 


### What materials are queen weighted blankets typically made from?

Most queen weighted blankets feature a cotton outer layer with a layer of glass or plastic beads sandwiched between the cotton and a soft-lined backing. These materials provide the necessary weight while maintaining breathability and comfort. 

Some premium blankets incorporate additional layers like bamboo viscose or minky fabric for extra softness and moisture-wicking properties. 


### Are queen weighted blankets machine washable?

Machine washing is usually safe for queen weighted blankets, but check the care label first. Most manufacturers recommend using a gentle cycle and cold water to prevent bead shifting and preserve the blanket's shape. 

After washing, ensure the blanket is thoroughly dry before using to prevent moisture trapped between the beads, which can lead to odors and settling. 


### How long do queen weighted blankets typically last?

With proper care, a high-quality queen weighted blanket can last 5 to 10 years. The longest-lasting blankets feature durable zippers, reinforced stitching, and premium materials that resist sagging or bead shifting. 

Daily use and washing can affect the blanket's longevity. Look for signs of wear like fraying edges, loose beads, or uneven weight distribution, which may indicate it's time for a replacement. 


### Can queen weighted blankets be used by children?

Weighted blankets are generally safe for children over 2 years old, with the exception of those with specific medical conditions. Opt for a child-specific blanket that meets safety standards and weighs 10% of the child's body weight. 

Always supervise children under 6 years old when using a weighted blanket and ensure the blanket is not too heavy to prevent overheating or suffocation risks.
