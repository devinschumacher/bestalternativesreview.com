To get the maximum 90% privacy blockage, users recommend installing two panels back-to-back. 


## Buyer's Guide

Plastic fencing rolls offer an affordable and durable solution for enclosing gardens, creating privacy screens, or defining property boundaries. Understanding their features and limitations will help you select the right roll for your specific needs. 


### Installation Requirements

Standard plastic fencing rolls typically measure 6 feet in height and vary in length from 10 to 25 feet. They require concrete footings or post bases for proper support. Consider the distance between supporting posts when selecting roll length to ensure stability and proper tension. 


### Material Durability

High-density polyethylene (HDPE) offers the best combination of strength and flexibility for plastic fencing rolls. HDPE resists UV degradation, maintains color integrity, and withstands harsh weather conditions. Look for rolls with a minimum 40-mil wall thickness for lasting performance. 


### Privacy and Noise Reduction

6-foot high plastic fencing rolls provide excellent privacy and reduce outdoor noise. Cellular core construction enhances thermal insulation, helping to maintain indoor comfort levels. For maximum soundproofing, select rolls with a solid core design and consider installing between 2 to 3 feet of distance between panels for added resonance control. 


### Color and Maintenance

Color is applied during the manufacturing process, ensuring consistent appearance and fade resistance. While most plastic fencing rolls require only occasional cleaning, maintaining their aesthetic appeal depends on proper installation and regular inspection for damage or wear. Regularly check for loose panels, signs of cracking, or damage from environmental factors. 


## FAQ


### What types of plastic fencing rolls are available?

Common plastic fencing rolls include PVC, high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and polyvinyl chloride compounded (PVC-C). These materials differ in durability, UV resistance, and flexibility. 

Choose PVC for its affordability and basic durability, HDPE for increased toughness and UV resistance, and PVC-C for its enhanced strength and chemical resistance. 


### How are plastic fencing rolls measured and sold?

Plastic fencing rolls are typically sold by linear feet, with standard lengths ranging from 100 to 200 feet per roll. Widths vary from 2 to 6 feet, depending on the manufacturer and intended application. 

When measuring for your project, account for gate openings, corners, and additional materials needed for installation. Always order extra to allow for cuts and waste during installation. 


### What factors affect the cost of plastic fencing rolls?

The primary cost drivers are material type, length, and width. HDPE and PVC-C tend to be more expensive than basic PVC. Longer rolls generally cost less per foot. 

Price may also vary based on location, volume purchases, and whether the roll includes cuts to specific lengths. Verify pricing from multiple suppliers to find the best deal. 


### How do different thicknesses affect plastic fencing roll strength?

Thicker plastic fencing rolls typically offer greater durability and impact resistance. Standard thicknesses range from 0.040 to 0.060 inches, with higher values providing better strength. 

For aggressive environments or commercial applications, consider rolls with 0.060-inch thickness or greater. Thinner rolls are suitable for residential areas with minimal traffic. 


### What maintenance requirements do plastic fencing rolls have?

Regular maintenance involves annual inspections for signs of damage, checking all connections for integrity, and addressing any loose panels promptly. Remove debris and examine for UV degradation every 6 months. 

In moderately aggressive environments, expect a 10-15 year lifespan with proper maintenance. Replace sections showing significant wear or damage to maintain uniform appearance and structural integrity. 


### Are plastic fencing rolls suitable for all weather conditions?

While most plastic fencing rolls resist cracking in freezing temperatures, some materials may show slight flexibility loss. Avoid extremely cold environments where the temperature regularly drops below -20°F (-29°C). 

Roll performance degrades in direct sunlight, especially for clear or UV-sensitive materials. Install additional shading or use specialized UV-resistant rolls for areas with intense sun exposure.
