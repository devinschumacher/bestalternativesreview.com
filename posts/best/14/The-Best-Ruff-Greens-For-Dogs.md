## FAQ


### What are Ruff Greens for dogs?

Ruff Greens are a type of dog supplement made from freeze-dried vegetables, specifically developed to support canine health and digestion. The product typically includes a blend of different vegetables that are rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. 

The formula often contains superfoods like green peas, sweet potatoes, and broccoli, which are known for their digestive benefits and nutritional value. These ingredients help support a healthy digestive system and provide essential nutrients that may be lacking in standard dog diets. 


### How do Ruff Greens benefit dogs?

Ruff Greens can help maintain digestive health by introducing more fiber into a dog's diet. The blend of vegetables supports regular bowel movements and promotes a healthy gut microbiome. Many pet owners also report improvements in their dogs' coat condition and energy levels. 

The nutritional benefits come from the vitamins and minerals present in the vegetables. These supplements can help support immune function, skin health, and overall well-being. However, it's important to note that they should be used as part of a balanced diet rather than a sole source of nutrition. 


### Which vegetables are included in Ruff Greens?

The specific vegetable blend can vary by brand, but common ingredients include green peas, sweet potatoes, broccoli, and carrots. These vegetables are carefully selected for their nutritional value and digestibility. 

The freeze-drying process preserves the vegetables' nutrients while reducing their moisture content. This makes the product more shelf-stable and convenient to use as a daily supplement. 


### Can I give Ruff Greens to all breeds and sizes of dogs?

Most dogs can safely consume Ruff Greens, regardless of their breed or size. However, it's always best to introduce new supplements gradually and monitor your dog's reaction. 

Larger and more active breeds may benefit more from the increased fiber and nutrient content. Smaller dogs or those with specific dietary needs should consult their veterinarian before starting any new supplement regimen. 


### How often should I give my dog Ruff Greens?

The recommended frequency can vary based on the product and your dog's specific needs. Most manufacturers suggest giving Ruff Greens daily as a maintenance supplement. 

Some pet owners choose to alternate with other supplements or vary the dose based on their dog's condition. Always follow the manufacturer's guidelines and consult with your veterinarian if you have specific questions about your pet's diet. 


### Where can I purchase Ruff Greens?

Ruff Greens products are typically available for purchase online through the manufacturer's website or through authorized retailers. Popular online marketplaces offer convenient options for finding these supplements. 

Local pet stores and veterinary clinics often carry Ruff Greens as well. Reading reviews and comparing prices across different sources can help you find the best option for your pet.
