## Buyer's Guide

Alkaline 88 water systems offer a unique approach to home water purification by adjusting the pH level of tap water to 8.8, which is slightly alkaline. Understanding these systems requires considering several key factors. 


### Technical Specifications

Look for systems with high-purity distillation technology that can remove up to 99.9% of contaminants. The filtration capacity should be rated for your specific water usage, typically measured in gallons per day. The storage tank capacity ranges from 1 to 5 gallons, so choose based on your daily consumption needs. 


### Installation Requirements

These systems require a dedicated faucet location and proper plumbing connections. The water heater must be at least 3 feet away to prevent electrical leakage. Basic installation usually takes about 2 hours, but professional setup is recommended for optimal performance and safety. 


### Maintenance Considerations

Regular maintenance includes quarterly filter cartridge replacement, annual descaling with white vinegar, and biannual inspection of the distillation chamber. The cost of replacement parts can add to the long-term operating expenses, typically ranging from $200 to $400 annually. 


### Performance Factors

The distillation process reduces water volume by about 20%, so plan accordingly for daily usage. The alkalinity increase is typically 7-8 pH points, making it suitable for cooking and drinking but not for daily bathing. Some systems include built-in remineralization features to restore beneficial minerals.
