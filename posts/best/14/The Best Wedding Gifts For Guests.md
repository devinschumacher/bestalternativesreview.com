## Buyer's Guide

Choosing the right wedding gift for guests can be a thoughtful way to celebrate a couple's new journey together. Here are key considerations and features to help you select a meaningful present. 


### Personalized Gifts

Customized items like monogrammed towels, engraved jewelry, or personalized address books allow guests to leave their mark on the couple's new home or life together. 


### Experience Gifts

Consider giving an experience like a cooking class, concert tickets, or a hot air balloon ride instead of physical gifts. These create lasting memories for the couple and memorable stories for guests to share. 


### Home Essentials

Popular categories include kitchen gadgets, candles, home decorations, and bath products. Choose items that fit the couple's style and practical needs for their new home. 


### Charitable Donations

Many couples appreciate having guests donate to their favorite causes instead of bringing gifts. This allows them to start their married life on a philanthropic note. 


## FAQ


### What types of wedding gifts are suitable for guests?

Guest-friendly wedding gifts include practical items, stylish accessories, and thoughtful experiences. Popular choices range from fine china and crystal decanters to personalized photo books and spa gift cards. 

When selecting a gift, consider the couple's current needs and interests. Practical items like kitchen gadgets or home decor enhance their living space, while experiences such as concert tickets or weekend getaways create lasting memories. 


### How much should I spend on a wedding gift?

The ideal gift cost varies based on your relationship with the couple and your financial situation. As a general guideline, most guests spend between $50 and $100 on wedding gifts. 

Some couples appreciate a more detailed registry or specific items listed on their registry. If you're unsure about the appropriate value, erring on the side of generosity is usually well-received. 


### What if I can't find something on their registry?

If the registry has been completed or you prefer a unique gift, consider browsing specialized wedding registries focused on specific interests. Many couples appreciate handmade items, experiences, or donations to their chosen charities. 

You can also check popular online registries where couples often add additional items beyond what's listed in physical stores. 


### Should I wrap the wedding gift?

Yes, always wrap wedding gifts in appropriate wrapping paper and include a personal note. This shows your thoughtfulness and respect for the couple's special day. 

Wrap in elegant paper that matches the overall wedding theme. Avoid wrapping paper with patterns that might clash with the couple's decor preferences. 


### What if I want to give cash?

Cash gifts remain popular, especially for destination weddings or when the couple has no registry. Place the cash in an elegant envelope with your name and a personalized message. 

Alternatively, you can gift a prepaid credit card with a personalized message, which offers more flexibility than cash and includes purchase protection features. 


### How do I address the wedding gift if it's being mailed?

Mailing a wedding gift? Address the package to the couple as a unit, using both names if different. Include your return address in case of any mail misdelivery. 

For multiple gifts, use a single package with multiple copies of the couple's address and your return address. This ensures all gifts go to the right place.
