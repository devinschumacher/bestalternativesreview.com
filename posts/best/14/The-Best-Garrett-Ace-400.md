## Buyer's Guide

The Garrett Ace 400 series includes several different metal detectors designed for various applications. Understanding the key features and considerations can help you choose the right model for your needs. 


### Operating Frequency

Garrett's 400 series uses VLF (Very Low Frequency) technology across different models. The operating frequency affects detection depth and sensitivity to different types of metals. Lower frequencies penetrate deeper but have less target discrimination. 


### Sensor Design

The Search Coil is crucial for performance. Larger coils increase detection range but reduce depth. Multi-zone designs offer flexibility, allowing you to adjust the coil's sensitivity and configuration for different ground conditions and target types. 


### Processing Technology

Advanced processing algorithms enhance target identification and reduce interference. Garrett's CDD (Constant Depth Detection) technology maintains consistent performance across different ground conditions. Some models feature multi-tone audio, where the pitch changes based on target depth and composition. 


### Power and Practical Features

Battery life and power management are important for field use. Models vary in their power consumption and included battery capacity. Practical features like water resistance, built-in LED display, and adjustable grips improve usability during extended use. 


## FAQ


### What's new in the Garrett Ace 400 compared to previous models?

The Garrett Ace 400 introduces several enhancements over its predecessors. It features improved resistance to interference from cell phones and other electronic devices, along with better performance in noisy urban environments. The updated design includes a more intuitive user interface and longer-lasting battery. 

Key upgrades include a faster search rate, deeper target detection, and improved discrimination settings. These changes make the device more reliable and efficient for both new and experienced users. 


### How does the Ace 400 perform in different soil types?

While no detector performs perfectly in all soil types, the Garrett Ace 400 shows marked improvement over its predecessors. It provides better target identification and deeper penetration in mineralized ground common to many locations. 

The device performs well in most soil types, with the ability to detect targets as deep as 15 inches in some conditions. However, performance may vary based on specific soil characteristics. 


### What kind of targets will the Ace 400 find?

The Garrett Ace 400 is designed to find a wide range of metallic targets, from coins and jewelry to rebar and buried objects. It performs particularly well on small, deep targets and has improved capabilities for finding objects in mineralized ground. 

Users can expect to find common targets like gold, silver, and copper coins, as well as more challenging materials like aluminum and rusted iron. The device's sensitivity makes it suitable for both casual and serious treasure hunting. 


### How heavy is the Garrett Ace 400?

The Garrett Ace 400 weighs approximately 5 pounds, making it one of the lighter models in its category. This weight makes it comfortable to carry and maneuver during extended use. 

The device's compact size and lightweight design are complemented by its durable construction. Users can expect the unit to remain stable and responsive during normal use, even with some vibration. 


### Can the Ace 400 detect non-metallic objects?

While the Garrett Ace 400 is primarily designed for metal detection, it has limited capability to detect certain non-metallic objects through electromagnetic induction. However, its primary function remains focused on metallic targets. 

Users should not rely on the device for detecting objects like pipes or cables that lack metallic content. For such applications, specialized equipment designed for electromagnetic conductivity is recommended. 


### How long does the battery last?

The Garrett Ace 400 battery typically provides up to 12 hours of continuous use on a single charge, depending on the specific settings and frequency of use. This duration allows for extended sessions without interruptions. 

Users can expect the battery to maintain this performance across multiple charge cycles. Regular maintenance of the battery and proper storage can further extend its lifespan and performance.
