## Buyer's Guide

A snap-on flashlight is a versatile accessory that mounts directly to your firearm's barrel or handguard, providing quick access to illumination during nighttime or low-light operations. This guide outlines key features to consider when selecting the right snap-on flashlight for your tactical equipment. 


### Light Output and Beam Pattern

Higher light output, typically measured in lumens, is essential for penetrating darkness and illuminating targets. For close-quarters combat, look for a narrow beam pattern with a concentration of light at shorter distances. Longer-range applications benefit from wider beam patterns that spread light over greater distances. 


### Power Source and Battery Life

Common power sources include disposable AA batteries, rechargeable lithium-ion packs, and proprietary rechargeable cells. Consider the convenience and longevity of each option. Battery life should align with your operational requirements, with higher capacity batteries offering longer illumination times. 


### Casing Material and Durability

The flashlight's construction dictates its reliability under harsh conditions. Common materials include aluminum, stainless steel, and polymer. Aluminum offers good durability and heat dissipation, while stainless steel provides superior corrosion resistance. The integrity of the mounting mechanism is crucial for maintaining proper alignment during impact. 


### Mounting Options and Compatibility

Standard mounting patterns include 11mm Picatinny rails, M-Lok systems, and proprietary mounts. Ensure the flashlight's mounting pattern matches your firearm's handguard configuration. Some models offer adjustable mounting heights to accommodate different weapon lengths and grip styles.
