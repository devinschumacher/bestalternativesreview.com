## Buyer's Guide

The Old Town Predator 13 is a popular category of boat, combining affordability with decent performance for recreational use. Understanding what makes these boats suitable for various activities can help you make an informed choice. 


### Size and Performance

The 13-foot length provides a good balance between stability and maneuverability, making it suitable for both calm lakes and mild river conditions. The hull design is typically sharp entry with a moderately rounded bottom, optimized for ease of handling and decent top-end speed without requiring excessive horsepower. 


### Construction Materials

Standard construction uses rotomolded polyethylene, offering durability and resistance to scratches and impacts. Advanced models may feature fiberglass or composite materials for increased rigidity and weight reduction, though these come at a higher price point. 


### Standard Features

Basic configurations include a single seat with adjustable backrest, folding aluminum wheels for transport, and basic storage compartments. Some models offer additional features like deck rails, padded feet, or drink holders, though these are typically optional extras. 


### Care and Maintenance

Regular cleaning with freshwater and mild soap is recommended, avoiding harsh chemicals that can damage the surface. Storage should be in a dry place when not in use, and the boat should be partially deflated and flipped over if being kept upright for extended periods. 


## FAQ


### What makes the Old Town Predator 13 different from other kayaks?

The Old Town Predator 13 stands out with its aggressive 15-degree bow and 9-degree stern, designed for swift water performance. The unique hull design combines with a polyethylene construction that resists scratches and impacts better than traditional materials. 

Unlike recreational kayaks that prioritize comfort and ease, the Predator 13 focuses on speed and maneuverability, making it a specialized choice for experienced kayakers who value performance over casual enjoyment. 


### How does the 13-foot length affect handling?

The 13-foot length provides a good balance between tracking ability and maneuverability in Class I and II rivers. It's longer than most single-person boats, which helps maintain straight course while paddling, but still short enough to navigate tight spaces and make quick turns. 

For reference, this length is similar to the Old Town XLC 13, which is also designed for confident paddling but has a slightly different hull shape optimized for different types of water features. 


### What storage options are available?

The kayak features a single storage hatch that runs the length of the deck, accessed via a durable snap-lock lid. This hatch can accommodate dry bags, gear, and personal items, making it suitable for day trips or weekend excursions. 

For longer trips or additional storage needs, the hatch can hold a significant amount of equipment. However, for bulky items or multiple large containers, you might want to consider additional dry storage solutions or a transport trailer. 


### How is the seat positioned?

The seat is located slightly forward, about 24 inches from the front of the kayak, which is typical for performance-oriented single-seater designs. This forward position helps with weight distribution and steering control during paddle strokes. 

For comparison, recreational kayaks often have seats closer to the middle, while whitewater-specific designs might have even more forward positioning. The 24-inch distance provides a comfortable, slightly aggressive posture that works well for technical maneuvers in swift water. 


### What's the best way to paddle the Old Town Predator 13?

While the kayak is designed for versatile paddling, it excels with an open-stroke technique common in whitewater kayaking. This means using the entire blade of your paddle for each stroke, rather than a closed or overhead stroke used in recreational kayaks. 

Practice proper body positioning with your torso facing down the centerline of the kayak, and your hips slightly forward of center. This posture helps maintain control and efficiency in the kayak's challenging design. 


### Can the kayak handle portages or carry gear?

Despite its performance focus, the kayak can comfortably carry standard paddle gear, life jackets, and personal items in the deck hatch. The design allows for efficient portage, with the wide cockpit making it easy to hoist the kayak onto your shoulders. 

However, for heavy loads or bulky gear, the hatch limits how much you can carry. Consider using dry bags and securing gear tightly to maintain balance and control while portaging.
