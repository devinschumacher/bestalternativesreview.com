The ReGeneration Task Chair from Knoll achieves remarkable comfort through simple yet effective design.

### [Knoll Re-Generation Ergonomic Office Chair](https://serp.ly/@bar/amazon/Knoll+Generation+Chair?utm\_term=knoll-re-generation-ergonomic-office-chair)

The Knoll Re-Generation chair deserves a second chance. While the paint job might need touch-ups and you'll want to check on the arm and seat conditions, the adjustable features make it worth the attention. The sliding arm pads and ergonomic back provide a customized fit, though the base quality leaves something to be desired.
