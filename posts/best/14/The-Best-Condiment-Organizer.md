A condiment organizer is a storage solution designed to keep small food items, like sauces, spreads, and seasonings, fresh and accessible. These organizers typically feature multiple compartments that prevent spillage and allow for organized storage in refrigerators or cabinets. 

They range from simple stackable containers to decorative serving pieces with built-in serving utensils, making them suitable for both practical storage and entertaining purposes. 


### What types of materials are condiment organizers made from?

Common materials include BPA-free plastic, glass, stainless steel, and food-grade silicone. Each material offers different benefits: plastic is lightweight and durable, glass provides clear visibility, stainless steel adds an elegant touch, and silicone creates flexible, stackable options.
