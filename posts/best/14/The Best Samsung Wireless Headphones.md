### How do I pair my Samsung wireless headphone with my device?

To pair your Samsung wireless headphone with a device, first ensure both the headphone and device are turned on. The headphone should appear as an available device in your phone or computer's Bluetooth settings. Select it to start the pairing process, and follow any on-screen instructions. 

If you encounter issues, try restarting both devices, checking for firmware updates, or resetting the headphone to factory settings. The pairing process may vary slightly depending on the specific model of your Samsung device and headphone.

Active noise cancellation is available on most models, with some offering up to 35dB of environmental noise reduction. The effectiveness varies based on the specific model and environmental conditions.
