## FAQ

![Whiteboard-Cleaner-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Whiteboard-Cleaner-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are the key ingredients in whiteboard cleaners?

Whiteboard cleaners typically contain a combination of water, alcohol, and degreasing agents to remove dry-erase markers and residue. These products often include solvents like isopropyl alcohol or glycol ether to break down ink and prevent it from setting, along with surfactants to enhance cleaning effectiveness. 

Some premium cleaners may also incorporate additives like pH balancers to protect the board surface and leave a slightly acidic residue that prevents marker adhesion. It's important to check the specific ingredients if you have sensitivities or concerns about certain chemicals. 


### How do I remove dried markers from a whiteboard?

Begin by applying a small amount of cleaner directly to the dried marker stain. Gently rub the affected area with a microfiber cloth or cleaner-applicator pad. For stubborn marks, let the cleaner sit for a minute before gently rubbing again. Dry the board thoroughly with a clean, lint-free cloth to prevent residue. 

For extremely stubborn stains, you can apply a layer of whiteboard cleaning solution directly to the marker residue using a clean cloth. Allow it to sit for several minutes, then use a whiteboard eraser to remove the residue. Clean the entire board to ensure no residue remains. 

![Whiteboard-Cleaner-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Whiteboard-Cleaner-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What surfaces can whiteboard cleaners damage?

Whiteboard cleaners are specifically formulated for use on whiteboard surfaces, including porcelain-coated aluminum and whiteboard paint. These products contain chemicals that can damage other materials, such as drywall, wood, or painted surfaces. Always test the cleaner on an inconspicuous area before widespread use. 

Some older whiteboards or surfaces with slight warping may show signs of damage if exposed to harsh chemicals. If you're unsure about your board's material or condition, consider a test spray in an unnoticeable corner before applying it to the entire surface. 


### How frequently should I use whiteboard cleaner?

Regular maintenance of your whiteboard requires cleaning after each use to prevent marker residue from setting. For heavy-use environments, you may need to clean the board daily. However, excessive cleaning can damage the surface and affect its longevity, so occasional deep cleaning with appropriate products is recommended. 

Monthly deep cleaning sessions using the appropriate board protector and cleaning solutions will help maintain the board's quality and prevent buildup of residue and grime. This balance between regular maintenance and occasional deep cleaning will extend the life of your whiteboard while keeping it clean and functional. 

![Whiteboard-Cleaner-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Whiteboard-Cleaner-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can I use household cleaners on my whiteboard?

Most household cleaners contain harsh chemicals that can damage whiteboard surfaces, alter the coating, or leave residue that affects marker performance. Always use products specifically designed for whiteboard maintenance to protect your investment and maintain optimal board performance. 

If you accidentally use an inappropriate cleaner, clean the board immediately with a whiteboard cleaner and a microfiber cloth. This prompt action can prevent damage and restore the board's functionality. For future cleaning, always refer to the manufacturer's recommendations for the specific whiteboard material. 


### What should I look for in a whiteboard cleaner?

When selecting a whiteboard cleaner, look for products that specifically mention compatibility with your board's surface type (porcelain-coated aluminum, plastic, etc. ). The cleaner should effectively remove marker residue without leaving streaks or residue. Avoid products with strong odors or harsh chemicals like bleach or abrasive agents. 

Check for additional features like UV protection in outdoor environments, scratch resistance, and durability against frequent cleaning. Premium cleaners often include protectants that enhance board performance after cleaning and prevent new marker stains. Reading customer reviews and comparing ingredients can help you find a high-quality product that meets your specific needs.
