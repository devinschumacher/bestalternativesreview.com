## Buyer's Guide

Lacrosse gloves are essential for protecting your hands while playing this fast-paced sport. These specialized gloves combine padding with flexibility to enhance grip and maneuverability. Understanding their features will help you choose the right pair for your skill level and playing style. 


### Hand Pads and Cushioning

Look for gloves with padded impacts zones on the thumb, pinky, and knuckles to guard against ball strikes. The palm should have multi-layered cushioning that prevents blisters while maintaining dexterity. Consider the padding's durability and how it distributes impact to reduce hand fatigue. 


### Thumb Support and Wraps

A thumb wrap provides crucial stability for stick handling and shooting. Quality gloves feature a reinforced thumb capsule that maintains its shape through repeated use. The wrap should stay in place during intense play while allowing natural thumb movement. 


### Grip Technology

The palm surface affects ball control and stick handling. Textured grips with channels or patterns increase friction without sacrificing dexterity. Some gloves incorporate micro-spike designs specifically for indoor play. Test different surface types to find what provides the best feel for your shooting and passing style. 


### Fit and Size Considerations

Proper fit is more important than size alone. The glove should fit snugly but allow two to three finger-widths between the glove and wrist. Adjustable wrist straps help customize fit and prevent wrist roll during impact. Consider whether you prefer short or long finger designs based on your comfort and play style. 


## FAQ


### What materials are lacrosse gloves typically made from?

Lacrosse gloves combine durable materials for protection and comfortable fabrics for wear. The outer layer usually consists of synthetic leather or composite materials that resist wear and tear. The inner padding and lining are made from foam, gel, or rubber for impact protection and moisture management. Many gloves incorporate mesh panels for ventilation and reduce heat buildup during play. 

Manufacturers also consider sensitivity when selecting materials. The fingers often feature padded fingertips with flexible construction to maintain control and feel of the ball while providing necessary protection from stick checks and collisions. 


### How do lacrosse gloves prevent hand injuries?

The primary protection comes from the hand padding, which absorbs shock during impacts with the stick or ball. The gloves encase the entire hand, including the knuckles and fingers, in a protective shell that restricts how much force can reach the bones and soft tissues. Some gloves incorporate impact-resistant inserts specifically designed to protect against stick checks and accidental collisions. 

Additional protection features like reinforced thumb caps and finger guards further reduce the risk of injury from common lacrosse incidents. The design focuses on preventing direct impacts to the hand, rather than absorbing the force of a ball impact like in baseball gloves. 


### How long do lacrosse gloves last?

With proper care and normal use, lacrosse gloves typically last 1-2 seasons, or about 200-400 hours of play. The lifespan depends on several factors including frequency of use, intensity of play, and how well the gloves are maintained. Gloves that show signs of wear such as broken padding, frayed edges, or significant scratches should be replaced. 

Proper care extends the life of your gloves. They should be air-dried after each use, kept in a protective case when not in use, and cleaned regularly with a mild soap and water solution. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners that can damage the glove material. 


### How should I size my lacrosse gloves?

Proper sizing ensures both protection and performance. Measure the circumference of your palm (excluding your thumb) and multiply by 1.5 for men's gloves, or by 1.25 for women's, as women's gloves run smaller. The length should extend from your wrist crease to just below your wrist, allowing about an inch of play between your wrist and the glove cuff. 

If the glove feels too loose, you risk reduced grip and protection. If too tight, your hands may sweat excessively and the gloves could become uncomfortable during extended play. Many manufacturers offer sizing charts and recommendations based on hand length and width measurements. 


### What are the different styles of lacrosse gloves?

There are three primary glove styles: Traditional, Mid-Hand, and Full-Hand. Traditional gloves provide basic protection with finger and thumb caps, while offering some mobility. Mid-Hand gloves cover the hand completely but stop short of the wrist, providing more protection than traditional models. Full-Hand gloves offer comprehensive protection from wrist to finger tips, commonly used in protective gear like padding or splints. 

Design variations include separate finger construction for better dexterity, reinforced palm areas for reduced wear, and extended wrist guards for additional impact protection. The right style depends on your position, play style, and personal preference for protection versus mobility. 


### How can I tell if my gloves fit properly?

A properly fitting glove feels secure without restrictions during movement. With the glove on, close your hand into a fist and press your thumb against the thumb cap. Your hand should sit naturally in the glove, with about an inch of play between your wrist and the glove cuff. There should be no bunching or folding of the palm material. 

Check the fit after activities that replicate game conditions. After running or catching drills, run your fingers along the seams to detect any new areas of looseness or tightness. The glove should feel identical to your other hand, with no significant pressure points or areas where the glove seems too loose to maintain proper form.
