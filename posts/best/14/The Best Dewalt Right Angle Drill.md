## Buyer's Guide

A Dewalt right angle drill combines the versatility of a traditional drill with increased reach and accessibility for hard-to-reach areas. These specialized tools offer numerous advantages, including improved torque delivery and compact design for various applications. 


### Key Specifications and Performance

When selecting a Dewalt right angle drill, focus on key specifications that impact performance and longevity. The motor power typically ranges from 7 to 12 amps, with higher amperage providing more torque for challenging materials. Look for drills with variable speed settings and reversible gears to handle different drilling and driving tasks effectively. 


###  Ergonomic Design and Operational Features

Ergonomic considerations are crucial for maintaining comfort during extended use. Opt for drills with padded grips and balanced weight distribution to reduce hand fatigue. Operational features like ergonomic triggers, finger rests, and robust handles enhance control and precision. Additionally, consider drills with dust extraction capabilities to maintain visibility and workspace cleanliness. 


###  Compatibility and Accessory Support

The drill's compatibility with various accessories expands its utility. Look for drills that accommodate a wide range of bits and attachments through secure chucks and collets. The included bit set should cover common drilling and driving applications. Consider drills with modular designs that allow for quick bit changes and additional tool attachment options. 


###  Durability and Build Quality

Durability is essential for tools that operate in demanding environments. Check for drills constructed with high-quality materials like stainless steel for the motor housing and wear-resistant seals for improved longevity. The drill's base should feature adjustable feet for secure positioning, while the cable management system helps prevent tangles and wear. 


## FAQ


### Which Dewalt right angle drill is right for me?

Choosing the right Dewalt right angle drill depends on your specific needs. The DCD791 is ideal for basic tasks due to its lightweight and compact design. For more powerful applications, the DCD792 offers enhanced torque and speed, suitable for professional work.

### What are the key features of Dewalt right angle drills?

Dewalt right angle drills feature a compact design with up to 360-degree rotation for tight access. Key specifications include volt rating, torque output, and speed settings. Many models offer adjustable chucks and LED lights for enhanced visibility. 

Look for drills with variable speeds, user-friendly controls, and durable construction. Advanced features may include Bluetooth connectivity for drill depth control and programmable memory settings for consistent drilling. 


### How long do Dewalt right angle drill batteries last?

The runtime of Dewalt right angle drill batteries varies based on voltage and usage intensity. Generally, a single charge provides 20-30 minutes of continuous use at moderate speeds. 

To maximize battery life, store the drill in a cool location when not in use. For longer-term storage, consider purchasing extended runtime batteries or a smart battery pack that monitors and maintains battery health. 


### What's the difference between corded and cordless Dewalt right angle drills?
