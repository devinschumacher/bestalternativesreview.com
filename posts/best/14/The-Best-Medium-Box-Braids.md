## Buyer's Guide

Medium box braids blend the durability of traditional braiding with a more relaxed length, suitable for everyday wear and special occasions. When selecting your box braids, consider your hair type, maintenance requirements, and desired style length. 


### Hair Type Compatibility

Box braids work best on all hair types, though the process may be more challenging with curly or tightly coiled hair. If you have fine or thin hair, opt for finer braids for a more natural look. For thicker hair types, consider chunkier braids or incorporating hair extensions to maintain volume and style definition. 

![Medium-Box-Braids-2](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Medium-Box-Braids-2/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Maintenance Requirements

MEDIUM box braids typically last 4-6 weeks with proper care. To maintain their shape and prevent tangling, wash your braids every 5-7 days using a clarifying shampoo designed for chemical-free hair. Avoid excessive heat styling and always detangle with a wide-tooth comb before washing. 


### Style Length Options

Box braids can be customized to various lengths between shoulder-length and slightly below chin-level. If you prefer shorter styles, choose smaller sections during application and consider adding a few inches by trimming your natural hair mid-length. Longer styles require more hair sections and may need periodic touch-ups. 

![Medium-Box-Braids-3](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Medium-Box-Braids-3/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Preparation and Application

Before applying medium box braids, ensure your natural hair is clean and free from tangles. Consider using a leave-in conditioner or hair oil to improve slideability. When applying, work in small sections, using a comb to guide each braid. Apply a protective product like a styling gel or crème to help maintain shape and prevent flyaways during the first week. 


## FAQ

![Medium-Box-Braids-4](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Medium-Box-Braids-4/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### What are Medium Box Braids?

Medium box braids are a style where small sections of hair are braided into neat rows, typically measuring between 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick. These braids cover the scalp with a grid-like pattern, allowing natural hair to remain visible between the braids. 

Unlike traditional box braids, which often require a significant amount of natural hair for extensions, medium box braids use shorter natural hair sections. This makes them a more versatile option for various hair textures and lengths. 


### What Hair Types Work Best with Medium Box Braids?

Medium box braids suit most hair types, especially when compared to thicker braids. Individuals with fine, straight, or curly hair can achieve good results. However, hair that is too thin or fine may need additional support from clips or scrunchies to maintain shape. 

The style works well for both African American and European American hair types. Those with tight curls or twists might find they need more frequent re-braiding to maintain the pattern. 

![Medium-Box-Braids-5](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Medium-Box-Braids-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### How Long Do Medium Box Braids Typically Last?

With proper care, medium box braids can last between 4 to 6 weeks. The duration depends on factors like how often you wash your hair, the frequency of moisturizing extensions, and your style habits. 

Regular maintenance, including quarterly trimming of the extension tips and weekly deep conditioning, helps prolong the life of the braids. Hair type and daily activities can also affect how long the braids last. 


### What Maintenance Is Required for Medium Box Braids?

The most common maintenance tasks are weekly washes using a gentle sulfate-free cleanser, followed by deep conditioning treatments once a month. Avoid using harsh chemicals or hot water, as they can damage the extensions and natural hair. 

Check for signs of splitting, dryness, or frizz daily. Split ends should be trimmed every 6 to 8 weeks to maintain healthy hair. Regular re-braiding in problem areas helps prevent tangling and maintain the style's integrity. 

![Medium-Box-Braids-6](https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Medium-Box-Braids-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black)


### Can You Sleep in Medium Box Braids?

Yes, sleeping in medium box braids is possible but requires some precautions. Use silk or satin pillowcases to minimize friction between the hair and pillow, which can cause breakage. 

Avoid sleeping on your stomach or side directly on your hair, as pressure points can loosen the braids. Consider wearing a satin hooded scarf to protect your hair while you sleep. 


### What Tools Should You Have for Medium Box Braids?

Essential tools include fine-tooth combs, bobby pins, spray water bottles, and clips. Fine-tooth combs prevent tangling, while bobby pins help secure loose hairs during the braiding process. 

Spray water bottles keep the hair manageable during styling, and clips (both regular and extendable) help contain long hair or manage sections while braiding. Consider getting braiding gloves to protect your nails during the process.
