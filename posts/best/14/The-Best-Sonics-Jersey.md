## Buyer's Guide

Sonics jerseys combine iconic team colors with premium fabrics for both court performance and casual wear. Understanding key features helps you select a jersey that matches your style and usage requirements. 


### Team and Sponsor Details

Check for accurate team name and sponsor logos. The official jersey typically displays the current season's primary sponsor. Verify these elements match your preferred version. 


### Fabric Quality and Weight

Premium jerseys use moisture-wicking polyester blends for dryness during intense play. Higher-end models include ventilation panels and breathable mesh underarms. Consider the weight based on whether you prefer a fitted feel or more roomy style. 


### Care Requirements

Look for moisture-wicking polyester blends that maintain color and shape after multiple washes. Higher quality jerseys often include reinforced stitching and taped seams for longevity. Consider how the care instructions align with your washing habits. 


### Fit and Sizing

Most manufacturers offer size charts, but fit can vary between brands. Premium jerseys often include more tailored options with performance details like compression shorts. Consider trying on multiple sizes to find the best fit. 


## FAQ


### What makes the Sonics Jersey unique?

The Sonics Jersey combines premium materials with innovative design elements, featuring a breathable mesh construction and moisture-wicking fabric to keep you comfortable during intense workouts. 

The jersey's classic Sonics colors pair with modern graphic elements, making it stand out on the court while maintaining a traditional look fans will recognize. 


### How does the sizing work?

Sizing runs true to form with a slightly fitted silhouette. Most customers find their standard size fits well, while those preferring a looser fit should consider sizing up. 

The jersey is available in sizes small through 3XL, with special attention to proper sleeve length and moisture management. 


### What maintenance tips do you recommend?

Clean the jersey after each wear to maintain its performance properties and extend its lifespan. Machine wash with similar colors using a mild detergent. 

Air dry the jersey flat or hang it to dry, avoiding direct heat sources like dryers or direct sunlight to prevent shrinkage and preserve the material's integrity. 


### Are the colors fade-resistant?

The Sonics Jersey uses color-lock technology to prevent dark streaks and fading after multiple washes. The main colors maintain their intensity even after repeated wear and washing. 

To further protect the colors, wash the jersey inside out and consider using color-safe products tailored for sports fabrics. 


### How does it perform in humid conditions?

The moisture-wicking technology effectively pulls sweat away from the skin, keeping the jersey dry and the wearer comfortable during high-intensity activities in humid environments. 

The combination of moisture management and breathable mesh panels helps maintain consistent temperature regulation, preventing the jersey from feeling overly clammy during play. 


### What is the return policy?

If you're not satisfied with your Sonics Jersey, you have 30 days from delivery to return it for a full refund. The jersey must be unused, in original packaging, and include all tags and accessories.
