Refurbished products typically include systems returned under warranty, demo units, and systems recovered from the field. They may have minor cosmetic imperfections, but all functionality is guaranteed to be working as intended. 


### What warranty does a Dell refurbished product come with?

All Dell refurbished products come with a minimum of Dell's standard warranty, which includes parts and labor. This typically ranges from 90 days to one year, depending on the specific product.
