### [TRESemmé Moisture-Rich Conditioner (39 oz)](https://serp.ly/amazon/Moisturizing+Conditioner?utm\_term=tresemmé-moisture-rich-conditioner-39-oz)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/Moisturizing+Conditioner?utm_term=tresemmé-moisture-rich-conditioner-39-oz"><img alt="tresemm--conditioner-with-pump-moisture-rich-39-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/tresemm--conditioner-with-pump-moisture-rich-39-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a product reviewer, I've been using the TRESemmé Moisture Rich Conditioner for a while now. First off, I have to say that the pump dispenser is quite convenient, making it easy to dispense the perfect amount of product without any dripping or mess. The conditioner has a light, refreshing scent that I really enjoy, and it makes my hair feel and smell great. But what really stands out is its ability to detangle my hair without any fuss. 

For me, the most impressive feature of this conditioner is how well it moisturizes my hair. It leaves my locks feeling soft, bouncy, and full of life. The hydrating formula deeply penetrates my dry hair, providing the much-needed moisture that helps maintain a radiant shine. And as someone with fine hair, I appreciate that the conditioner doesn't weigh it down, so my hair remains light and easy to style. 

The combination of this conditioner and the TRESemmé Moisture Rich Shampoo creates the perfect duo for my hair needs. While I haven't noticed any significant difference in volume, the conditioner certainly helps control my frizz and gives my hair a smooth, shiny finish. 

One minor downside is that the pump sometimes dispenses a bit more product than needed, but overall, it hasn't been a major issue for me. Additionally, I wish the product's packaging was sturdier to prevent potential spills. 

In conclusion, the TRESemmé Moisture Rich Conditioner has been a great addition to my daily hair care routine. It provides excellent moisture, detangles my hair without any hassle, and leaves it with a lovely scent and shine. Despite the minor inconveniences, I'd highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a high-quality, moisturizing conditioner that suits a range of hair types.

I've noticed that my hair looks healthier and has a much smoother texture, which was a big plus for me. 

One of the features that really stood out for me was the fact that this conditioner is dermatologically tested and cruelty-free. I'm always on the lookout for products that not only benefit my skin but also align with my ethical values. Knowing that the conditioner was made using recycled plastic is another bonus, as it reflects a commitment to environmental responsibility.

### What is a moisturizing conditioner and how does it work?

A moisturizing conditioner is a type of hair care product that combines the benefits of a conditioner and a moisturizer. It helps to hydrate and nourish the hair, making it softer, more manageable, and less prone to breakage. The product works by coating the hair shaft with hydrating ingredients, which are then absorbed into the hair and scalp. This helps to strengthen the hair and prevent damage caused by chemical treatments, styling tools, and environmental factors. Moisturizing conditioners are suitable for all hair types and are especially beneficial for those with dry, damaged, or chemically treated hair. 

Some common ingredients found in moisturizing conditioners include silicones, which help to smooth and detangle the hair; proteins, which repair and strengthen the hair; and natural oils, such as argan or coconut oil, which provide deep hydration and nourishment to the hair and scalp. These ingredients work together to create a nourishing and hydrating formula that leaves the hair feeling soft and healthy.

### How do I choose the right moisturizing conditioner for my hair type?

When selecting a moisturizing conditioner, it's essential to consider your hair type, as some products are specifically designed to address the unique needs of different hair types. For example, if you have dry or damaged hair, you may want to look for a product that contains a high concentration of hydrating ingredients, such as natural oils or humectants. If you have oily or fine hair, on the other hand, you may want to choose a lighter formula that won't weigh down your hair or make it look greasy. 

Another factor to consider when choosing a moisturizing conditioner is your hair's porosity. This refers to the hair's ability to absorb and retain moisture. If you have low porosity hair, you may want to choose a product that contains ingredients that help to improve the hair's ability to hold onto moisture, such as proteins or humectants. For high porosity hair, you may want to choose a product that contains ingredients that help to seal in moisture, such as natural oils or butters.

Using a moisturizing conditioner offers several benefits, including: hydration, nourishment, and protection for your hair. By providing your hair with the hydration it needs, a moisturizing conditioner helps to prevent breakage and damage caused by environmental factors, heat styling, and chemical treatments. It also helps to detangle your hair, making it easier to manage and style, and leaves your hair feeling soft and healthy. 

A moisturizing conditioner can also help to repair and strengthen your hair over time. Many products contain proteins that help to repair damaged hair, while natural oils and butters provide deep nourishment and help to prevent further damage. By using a moisturizing conditioner regularly, you can help to improve the overall health and appearance of your hair. 


### Can I use a moisturizing conditioner as a leave-in treatment?

Yes, you can use a moisturizing conditioner as a leave-in treatment if you choose a product specifically formulated for this purpose. Many moisturizing conditioners are designed to be left in the hair after shampooing and rinsing, providing ongoing hydration and nourishment throughout the day. To use a moisturizing conditioner as a leave-in treatment, simply apply a small amount to the hair after shampooing and rinsing, and then style as usual. 

If you're using a moisturizing conditioner as a leave-in treatment, it's important to choose a product that won't weigh down your hair or leave it looking greasy. Look for a lightweight formula that contains natural oils or butters to provide deep hydration without weighing down the hair. You may also want to choose a product that's free of silicones, as these can leave a residue on the hair that can make it look greasy or dull. 


### How often should I use a moisturizing conditioner?

The frequency with which you use a moisturizing conditioner depends on the type of hair you have and the specific product you're using. If you have dry, damaged, or chemically treated hair, you may want to use a moisturizing conditioner every time you shampoo, or even more frequently if your hair is particularly dry. 

If you have oily or fine hair, you may want to use a moisturizing conditioner less frequently, as applying too much product to your hair can make it look greasy or weigh it down. In this case, you may want to use a lightweight product once or twice a week, or as needed to maintain your hair's health and moisture levels. 


### I've heard that some moisturizing conditioners contain sulfates. Are these products still effective?

Yes, moisturizing conditioners that contain sulfates can still be effective at hydrating and nourishing your hair. However, it's worth noting that sulfates are a common ingredient in many personal care products, and they can be drying to the hair and scalp. If you're interested in using a sulfate-free moisturizing conditioner, you may want to look for a product that contains natural ingredients, such as natural oils, butters, or proteins. 

It's also worth mentioning that sulfates are not inherently bad for your hair. Some sulfates are actually derived from natural sources, such as coconut or palm oil, and are considered to be gentle and effective at cleansing the hair and scalp. If you do choose to use a moisturizing conditioner that contains sulfates, be sure to read the product label carefully to ensure that it contains ingredients that are appropriate for your hair type and that you're comfortable using.
