Introduced in 2015, the delicate fragrance is a perfect addition to any woman's collection. The scent is light, airy, and ideal for everyday wear. Fresh and invigorating, Walk on Air boasts a blend of floral, citrus, and earthy notes that together create an enchanting aroma. Tunisian neroli and Calabrian bergamot provide a luscious, juicy opening, while linden blossom and Solomon's seal add a soft, sweet floral touch. The middle notes present a lovely bouquet of narcissus, Egyptian jasmine, southern magnolia, and lily of the valley. These beautifully complement a cooling touch of violet leaf, white iris, and crinum lily for a powdery base.

Recognized for its unique style and elegance, Kate Spade has become a household name synonymous with quality, craftsmanship, and timeless appeal. 

Not all reviews have been praiseworthy, however. Some users have described the fragrance as more suitable for younger people or those who prefer subtle scents. Others have noted issues with the spraying mechanism or the longevity of the scent. 

Overall, Walk on Air by Kate Spade remains a highly sought-after fragrance, perfect for those seeking a light, airy scent suitable for any occasion. Its popularity is no surprise, as the brand continues to captivate the hearts and minds of fashion enthusiasts worldwide.

The Walk on Air by Kate Spade fragrance is a delightful, light, and refreshing aroma that I've enjoyed wearing in my daily life. The sweet undertones of lily of the valley, magnolia, and crinum lily are like a breath of fresh air, making me feel graceful and confident. 

I particularly appreciate the beautiful packaging, which is a perfect addition to my collection. The black bow on the green bottle with the metal cap truly makes it stand out among other perfumes. As a gift, it would surely bring a smile to any lady's face. 

One notable issue I faced is the fragrance spray not working as intended, but fortunately, customer service came to the rescue and helped me with the situation.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Kate+Spade+Walk+On+Air?utm_term=kate-spade-walk-on-air-fragrance-for-women-lightweight-scent-experience"><img alt="kate-spade-8-4-oz-walk-on-air-fragrance-mist-for-women-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/kate-spade-8-4-oz-walk-on-air-fragrance-mist-for-women-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently started using the Kate Spade 8.4 oz Walk on Air Fragrance Mist for Women, and let me tell you, the experience has been nothing short of refreshing. As someone who prefers lighter, airier scents, this body spray delivered on all fronts. Its floral woodsy fragrance reminds me of a summer breeze through a blossoming garden, making it the perfect addition to my daily routine. 

The highlight for me was the sheer ease with which I could apply it. The spray bottle made it effortless to spritz a few pumps on and feel instantly revitalized. Additionally, the fact that one bottle lasts for around two months makes it a practical and economical choice. 

However, there was a slight downside. While the scent was light and delightful, it didn't seem to last as long as I'd hoped. Within only a few hours, the refreshing aroma had largely faded away. 

Despite this minor letdown, I'm still very satisfied with the Kate Spade 8.4 oz Walk on Air Fragrance Mist for Women. Its fresh, breezy scent and convenient application make it an excellent choice for anyone looking to add a touch of nature to their daily life.

Founded by Kate Spade, this enchanting creation is infused with a delicate fragrance that leaves a lasting impression. The perfume is perfect for those who like to keep things fresh and unique, as the scent is not easily forgotten. The bottle itself is an eye-catching masterpiece, featuring a green glass body and a sleek metal cap adorned with a black bow. 

The top notes of Walk on Air feature a crisp blend of Tunisian neroli and Calabrian bergamot, creating a sparkling sensation that is both invigorating and mesmerizing. As the scent develops, it transforms into a bouquet of blossoms, with narcissus, Egyptian jasmine, southern magnolia, and lily of the valley, giving the perfume a lush and plush feel. A touch of violet leaf, combined with white iris and crinum lily, adds a delicate powdery base, rounding out the overall scent profile. 

The longevity and quality of Walk on Air have proven to be impressive, with many reviewers praising the scent for its ability to last throughout the day. The perfume has become a staple in the Kate Spade product line, and its success has been a testament to the brand's dedication to creating captivating and unique fragrances. 

While the scent of Walk on Air has garnered a loyal following, there have been some minor issues with the quality of some bottles, including clogged nozzles or weak sprayers.

### [Kate Spade Walk On Air Gift Set - Fragrant Eau de Parfum and Face Mist for Women](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Kate+Spade+Walk+On+Air?utm\_term=kate-spade-walk-on-air-gift-set-fragrant-eau-de-parfum-and-face-mist-for-women)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Kate+Spade+Walk+On+Air?utm_term=kate-spade-walk-on-air-gift-set-fragrant-eau-de-parfum-and-face-mist-for-women"><img alt="walk-on-air-by-kate-spade-for-women-2-pc-gift-set-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/walk-on-air-by-kate-spade-for-women-2-pc-gift-set-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a lover of Kate Spade fragrances, I was delighted to receive this Walk on Air 2 PC Gift Set. The perfume itself is a delightful mix of florals and citrus notes, leaving a subtle yet memorable scent. The set includes both the perfume spray and a convenient face mist, perfect for on-the-go touch-ups. 

However, I was a little disappointed with the packaging. The products seemed to be carefully tucked inside a box with only tissue paper to cushion them. It felt a bit lackluster and cheap, compared to the quality of the fragrance itself. 

Another issue I encountered was the discrepancy between the perfume's scent and the scent of the face mist. While the perfume was a lovely floral medley, the face mist had a distinct, almost minty scent that was quite surprising and not at all pleasant. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I still found this Walk on Air set to be a great deal, offering 100ml of perfume for just $40. Overall, I'd say it's a solid choice for someone looking for a new, affordable scent from a trusted brand. 


### [Kate Spade Walk on Air Body Spray: Fresh Floral Woodsy Scent](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Kate+Spade+Walk+On+Air?utm\_term=kate-spade-walk-on-air-body-spray-fresh-floral-woodsy-scent)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Kate+Spade+Walk+On+Air?utm_term=kate-spade-walk-on-air-body-spray-fresh-floral-woodsy-scent"><img alt="kate-spade-walk-on-air-body-spray-8-4-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/kate-spade-walk-on-air-body-spray-8-4-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Kate Spade's Walk on Air body spray is a delightful and fresh addition to my daily routine. Being a fan of floral scents, I was intrigued by the citrus, herbal, and floral notes promised by this mist. 

Upon first spray, I was pleasantly surprised by the light but distinct aroma. It didn't overpower me, but rather complemented my personal style. In fact, the scent is subtle yet pleasant with an airy and light feel that was refreshing. The citrus undertones gave it a unique twist compared to other floral fragrances I've tried in the past. 

The other positive aspect of Walk on Air is its long-lasting nature. Even after several hours, I could still catch a whiff of the fragrance. Plus, it was great to have that refreshing smell throughout the day without having to reapply excessively. 

However, there were a couple of minor drawbacks I faced. Firstly, the body spray would sometimes leave a slight powdery residue on my clothes and pillowcases. While it washed off easily, it wasn't the most ideal situation. Secondly, the bottle seemed to make more of an airy sound than the subtle fizz I had hoped for. 

Overall, Kate Spade's Walk on Air body spray is a fantastic choice for someone like me who enjoys floral scents that aren't too overpowering. Its distinctive aroma and long-lasting effect make it a perfect daily mist for freshening up. While the minor shortcomings might be a concern for a few, they certainly do not take away from the positive benefits this body spray has to offer.
