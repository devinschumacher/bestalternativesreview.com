### [Merrytech Solar Lanterns: Waterproof, Outdoor Patio Decor with LED Lighting](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Hanging+Solar+Lanterns?utm\_term=merrytech-solar-lanterns-waterproof-outdoor-patio-decor-with-led-lighting)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Hanging+Solar+Lanterns?utm_term=merrytech-solar-lanterns-waterproof-outdoor-patio-decor-with-led-lighting"><img alt="merrytech-solar-lanterns-outdoor-waterproofmetal-watering-can-sun-lamp-led-garden-decor-outsidehangi-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/merrytech-solar-lanterns-outdoor-waterproofmetal-watering-can-sun-lamp-led-garden-decor-outsidehangi-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Over the past few weeks, I've been using the Merrytech Solar Watering Can in my backyard to add some life to my outdoor space. The product is really well-made and has a unique design. It catches the attention of anyone who passes by, with its water-like movement emanating from every sprinkle. 

One of the most impressive features is the energy-saving aspect of it. The built-in solar panels allow it to charge during the day without any extra effort, and it can then work for up to 8 hours on a single charge. It's always running and doesn't require any electricity bill, which is a huge plus. 

The lantern itself is also very durable and waterproof. I've had it out in the rain and it hasn't shown any signs of damage. It can even be hung or placed independently, giving you the flexibility to use it as a standalone decoration as well. 

However, there is one downside. The sprinkler effect isn't very strong, so it might not water your plants as effectively as a regular watering can. Also, after a while, the lights started to flicker and seem to be losing their brightness. 

Overall, I would still highly recommend the Merrytech Solar Watering Can for anyone looking to add a unique and energy-saving outdoor lighting decoration to their garden.

I recently tried the Techko Solar Portable Hanging Lantern, and I have to say, it's a great addition to any outdoor space.

The flame mode is particularly mesmerizing, and I found myself drawn to it every time I passed by. The IP65 waterproof rating also adds peace of mind, as I know the lantern can withstand various weather conditions. 

However, one downside I noticed was the lifespan of the light. While it does last up to 12 hours on a full charge, it seemed to lose its brightness by the time it reached the end. This could be an issue if you're planning on using the lantern for long periods, as you may need to place it in direct sunlight more often to maintain its brightness.

### What are the differences between traditional and hanging solar lanterns?

Hanging solar lanterns are an innovative, eco-friendly replacement for traditional lighting options. Unlike traditional lighting, which relies on wired electricity and frequent battery replacements, hanging solar lanterns use solar energy to power LED lights and do not require any external power source.

Moreover, hanging solar lanterns are designed to be hung from a ceiling or hanging space, providing ambient light and an elegant touch to outdoor areas such as patios, gardens, and balconies. Traditional lanterns, on the other hand, are usually freestanding and require more effort to install and maintain.


### How do hanging solar lanterns work?

Hanging solar lanterns work by harnessing energy from the sun through built-in solar panels. During the day, the solar panels charge the lantern's rechargeable battery. The battery then powers the LED lights at night or when the light sensor detects low-light conditions. Most hanging solar lanterns have an automatic on/off function that ensures the lights are only turned on when needed, extending the battery life.

The lanterns are typically equipped with adjustable settings, allowing users to choose the brightness level and timing of when the lights turn on and off. This flexibility enables users to create a comfortable and personalized outdoor lighting experience that meets their needs and preferences.

Hanging solar lanterns offer several advantages for outdoor spaces. First and foremost, they provide functional and decorative illumination without the need for wired electricity, making them an eco-friendly and cost-effective lighting solution.
