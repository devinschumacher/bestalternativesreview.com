### [Knipex 12 in. Alligator Pliers: Insulated, Non-Slip, Serrated, and Robust Hand Tool](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Knipex?utm\_term=knipex-12-in-alligator-pliers-insulated-non-slip-serrated-and-robust-hand-tool)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Knipex?utm_term=knipex-12-in-alligator-pliers-insulated-non-slip-serrated-and-robust-hand-tool"><img alt="knipex-12-in-alligator-pliers-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/knipex-12-in-alligator-pliers-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Over the past few weeks, I've been using the Knipex 12-inch Alligator Pliers as my go-to tool for many hands-on projects. It's not just a plier, it's a workhorse. 

One of the things that stands out to me is the gripping surface; it's serrated and has a slightly rough texture. This makes it easier for me to handle objects, especially when I'm dealing with slippery or uneven surfaces. Additionally, the non-slip plastic handle provides a secure grip, reducing any chance of accidental drops. 

The box-joint design and the pinch guard also add a layer of safety to the tool. Working in tight spaces can be tricky, but the slim size of the head and joint area lets me reach corners and edges easily. 

However, there's one thing that I found a bit challenging: changing the positioning for adjustment. It takes a bit of practice, but once I got the hang of it, I was able to use all nine adjustment positions with ease. 

Overall, the Knipex 12-inch Alligator Pliers have become an indispensable part of my toolkit. Whether I'm working on a car engine or a DIY project around the house, these pliers have proven to be robust and versatile. Despite the slight difficulty I faced with adjustment, the benefits of this tool far outweigh the challenge.

These Knipex 9" High Leverage Combination Pliers are truly some of the best linesman pliers out there.

While using these pliers, I've noticed that they are lightweight and easy to carry on the go. The built-in wire cutter is an added bonus, making it an even more versatile tool. The plier's slim head also allows access to tight spaces where other tools might struggle.
