After marking the desired installation points, dig a trench to lay the low voltage cable. The cable should be buried at least six inches below the ground to prevent damage and ensure safety. Connect the lights to the transformer, which is typically installed near an accessible power outlet. Ensure that all connections are secure, and the wiring is properly insulated for added protection. Finally, turn on the power to test the installation and enjoy your new low voltage outdoor lighting. 


### Can low voltage outdoor lighting be used for security purposes?

Yes, low voltage outdoor lighting can be used for security purposes. Floodlights and spotlights are particularly well-suited for this application, as they provide a wide and intense illumination. These lights can help deter intruders and aid in surveillance, making your outdoor space safer and more secure. You can also install motion sensor lights or smart lights that activate only when they detect movement, further enhancing your security system. 

When choosing lights for security purposes, consider the overall brightness, coverage area, and the ability to adjust the light intensity and direction. Additionally, installing lights at key points around your property, such as near entryways, garages, and windows, can help create a more secure environment.
