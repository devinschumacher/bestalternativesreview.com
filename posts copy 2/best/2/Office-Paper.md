<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Office+Paper?utm_term=high-quality-office-paper-pack-500-sheets-8-5-x-11"><img alt="white-bond-copier-paper-500-sheets-8-1-2-x-11-in-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/white-bond-copier-paper-500-sheets-8-1-2-x-11-in-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried using this "White Bond Copier Paper" in my daily life and have to say, it was a great experience. With 92 brightness, it met all my everyday copying and printing needs. 

The small pack sizes made it convenient for both my home and small office use. However, I noticed that it wasn't perfect for high-speed volume applications, and might be better suited for smaller print jobs.

Featuring an unruled paper rule type, this versatile paper caters to various printing needs. It can be purchased in a multipack, making it an optimal option for both home and office use. 

Despite its numerous benefits, some customers found it lacking, specifically due to extended waiting times for pickup and the absence of notifications. 


### [High-Quality Office Paper with 50% Recycled Content](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Office+Paper?utm\_term=high-quality-office-paper-with-50-recycled-content)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Office+Paper?utm_term=high-quality-office-paper-with-50-recycled-content"><img alt="boise-aspen-50-multi-use-printer-copy-paper-white-letter-8-5-inch-x-11-inch-500-sheets-per-ream-20-l-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/boise-aspen-50-multi-use-printer-copy-paper-white-letter-8-5-inch-x-11-inch-500-sheets-per-ream-20-l-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a dedicated office worker, I often find myself in need of high-quality printer paper. The Boise Aspen 50 Multi-Use Printer & Copy Paper has been a lifesaver for me due to its impressive performance. 

One of the most attractive features of this product is its compatibility with all office equipment. It's been a reliable go-to for all my printing and copying needs, even in my busiest days. The consistent performance and excellent runnability have been much appreciated. 

The paper is sourced from certified managed forests, which not only adds to its eco-friendliness but also supports the growth of urban parks through Project UP. It's always rewarding to know I'm contributing to a good cause. 

However, there were a few drawbacks to my experience with the Boise Aspen 50 Multi-Use Printer & Copy Paper. The box arrived with some damage, and I noticed a couple of sheets had some smudges on them, which raised concerns about its overall quality. I also noticed a slight difference in the width of the paper compared to other brands I've used, which may lead to some minor misalignments in printing. 

Despite these minor issues, I'm happy with the paper's overall performance. I highly recommend the Boise Aspen 50 Multi-Use Printer & Copy Paper for anyone looking for a reliable office paper option. 


### [Staples Select Copy Paper: High-Quality Office Paper - 8.5" x 11", 500 Sheets per Pack](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Office+Paper?utm\_term=staples-select-copy-paper-high-quality-office-paper-8-5-x-11-500-sheets-per-pack)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Office+Paper?utm_term=staples-select-copy-paper-high-quality-office-paper-8-5-x-11-500-sheets-per-pack"><img alt="staples-copy-paper-select-8-5-x-11-10-pack-500-sheets-each-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/staples-copy-paper-select-8-5-x-11-10-pack-500-sheets-each-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I was in dire need of sturdy office paper that wouldn't waste my printer's time with paper jams. Enter the Staples Copy Paper Select. The first thing that caught my eye was the case containing ten reams with 500 sheets each; a generous amount that saved me the trouble of reordering frequently. Upon closer inspection, the bright white paper's clear and robust contrast stood out as a game-changer for my printed documents. Gone were the days of dealing with dull and grainy prints. 

What really sealed the deal for me was the product's versatility in both laser and inkjet printers. The acid-free feature was an added bonus, ensuring that the paper wouldn't turn yellow or crumble over time. My printer and my wallet were both rejoicing, thankful for this cost-effective and high-quality choice. Sure, it's a bit of a heavier paper, but for the professional-grade prints it delivers, it's well worth the extra weight. 

One of the cons, however, is the thin paper wrap that can result in the paper getting wet or damaged if left in a humid place. This makes it more challenging to keep around the office, especially in humid areas like the front doorstep. And though the product has a high rating, it's not perfect - other users have reported slight issues with paper curling and ink color inconsistencies. But overall, I'd say the Staples Copy Paper Select is a reliable staple for any office.

Recently, I gave EarthChoice's 11 x 17-inch office paper a try in my daily life and here's what I experienced. The paper's durability was certainly noticeable, with the 20-pound paper weight preventing ink from bleeding through. I particularly enjoyed the ColorLok technology which guaranteed fast drying and clear, vivid colors. However, one downfall was that not all the sheets were cut down to a precise 8.5 x 11 measurement, often resulting in misaligned staples. 

This paper proved to be an eco-friendly choice with its acid-free construction that resists yellowing and fading. Certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, I felt good using a sustainable option for my office. Overall, the EarthChoice paper performed adequately for everyday copying and internal correspondence, providing sharp, clear print results. It's a dependable, sustainable option that offers a perfect balance of quality and affordability.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Office+Paper?utm_term=hp-office-ultra-white-paper-500-sheets-high-quality-8-5-x-14-option"><img alt="hp-office-ultra-white-paper-8-5-x-14-500-sheets-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hp-office-ultra-white-paper-8-5-x-14-500-sheets-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the pleasure of using the HP Office Ultra-White Paper, and boy, was it a nice change from the generic paper I've been using. The first thing that stood out was its vibrant whiteness. It's not just plain white; it's like high-definition white, making everything print much sharper and clearer. Not only that, but the vivid colors actually looked vivid. The print dried super fast, and there were no smears, which was a plus. 

The paper is optimized for high-volume printing and copying of everyday business documents. I found it worked well with both inkjet and laser printers and copiers. It was also FSC certified, acid-free with great archival quality. 

As for the negative, I'd have to say that the packaging was a bit off on mine. It arrived with a torn wrapper, which, albeit not a deal-breaker, was a bit disappointing. Another issue was that the description showed one size and count of paper, but when I swiped to the right, there was a difference in both size and count. But, these are minor drawbacks compared to the overall experience. 

Overall, I'm really happy with this office paper. It's perfect for my high-volume printing and copying needs, and I appreciate the brilliant colors it produces. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable office paper solution.

Additionally, while the paper was high quality, smooth, and recyclable, the packaging could use some improvement to prevent damage during shipping.

It's white, it's multipurpose, and it contains a whopping 80 sheets. The best part? It's super cheap.

The acid-free nature is an added bonus, extending the lifespan of my printed paperwork. It feels quite sturdy, standing up to the daily wear and tear without creasing or tearing. 

However, there were certain aspects that I felt could have been improved. If I was being nitpicky, there was quite a bit of paper waste per sheet when cutting as it often ended up slightly larger than A4 size. Additionally, the print quality, while generally consistent, sometimes failed to impress. 

Overall, considering the budget-friendly price, range of applications, and undeniably bright white finish, the Bazic 80 Count White Multipurpose Paper has become a staple in my office supplies. It may not be the highest of quality, but for everyday use, it certainly passes muster.

### [Efficient Copy Printing with Double A Legal-Sized Premium White Paper](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Office+Paper?utm\_term=efficient-copy-printing-with-double-a-legal-sized-premium-white-paper)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Office+Paper?utm_term=efficient-copy-printing-with-double-a-legal-sized-premium-white-paper"><img alt="double-a-copy-multipurpose-paper-white-851421" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/double-a-copy-multipurpose-paper-white-851421/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

In my quest for a reliable and versatile printing paper, I decided to give Double A's legal-size premium copy paper a try. This paper has been recommended to me by colleagues who are always on the lookout for top-notch office supplies, so I was eager to see what the hype was all about. 

Upon unboxing the paper, I immediately noticed its smooth surface, which seemed to promise excellent runnability and minimal paper jams. The high brightness level was another feature that caught my attention, as it made me confident that the printed text would be crisp and sharp, with no issues of fading or loss of detail. 

As I started using the paper in my day-to-day tasks, I was pleasantly surprised by its ability to resist ink bleed-through. This feature is crucial for legible results, especially when working on documents that require professional presentation or archiving. 

However, I did encounter a few minor issues. Despite the impressive 22Lb thickness, I found that this paper wasn't quite as opaque as I would have liked for double-sided printing. While it worked well for single-sided color printing, it wasn't the best choice for my professional needs. 

Additionally, I was disappointed to find out that the paper in my initial box had been damaged during delivery. Although the ream was still usable, the incident left a negative impression on my overall experience. 

Nevertheless, I have to say that Double A's legal-size premium copy paper has been a reliable and high-quality choice for my personal and professional printing needs. Its smooth finish, high brightness level, and resistance to ink bleed-through make it an excellent choice for everyday use at home, school, or office.

In the world of business, nothing speaks more to efficiency than having a ready and ample supply of paper to keep your machines churning out documents. With Office Depot's copy & print paper, you can do just that. Made for smooth, consistent performance, these paper reams never disappoint, making it a go-to for your office's printing and copying needs. 

One of the stand-out features I've noticed is the paper's brightness, clocking in at 92 (U. S. ) and 104 (Euro). This vivid clarity yields crisp text and vivid images, ensuring your documents look professional and well-presented. Another key point is the paper's acid-free composition, which means it won't yellow or discolor over time, a common issue with lesser quality paper. It's especially helpful if your office prints important documents that need to remain looking pristine. 

However, there are a couple of downsides to using this paper. One is the shipping packaging. A few customers have reported receiving their paper reams in damaged condition, which isn't ideal for a product that's meant to be stored for a long period of time. Additionally, the shipping process is not environmentally friendly, as the paper isn't packed in a larger, protective box. This could be a concern for some environmentally conscious businesses. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, Office Depot's copy & print paper has proven to be an impressive product in terms of durability and color quality. It's a reliable choice for all your paper needs and at a price point that won't break the bank. Stocked in a case of five reams, it's a convenient and cost-effective solution for maintaining a steady supply of paper in your office.

As someone who frequently juggles deadlines and last-minute printing tasks, I've found a reliable ally in the Hammermill Copy Plus Print Paper. This unassuming yet dependable ream of printer paper has been my go-to choice for general office use, and it's served me well in my high-speed copiers, dry tone copiers, and fax machines. 

One of the most appealing aspects of the Copy Plus Paper is its 99.99% Jam-Free Guarantee, which ensures a smoother printing experience. With ColorLok technology, the black print is an impressive 60% bolder, and the colors are a vivid 30% brighter. This means that my printed documents never look washed out or pale, and even the ink dries unnaturally fast, saving time and energy. 

Despite its acid-free nature, the paper still delivers on a high-quality, archival experience, preventing that dreaded yellowing effect over time. It's even environmentally friendly as it contributes towards satisfying credit MR1 under LEED. 

However, the packaging could do with a few tweaks to prevent damage during shipping. While the product itself is always in top condition, I've encountered one or two instances where the outer wrapping arrived ripped, and the ream was shipped in a larger box than necessary. This has caused some issues with a duplex printer; however, these instances have been few and far between. 

Overall, the Hammermill Copy Plus Print Paper has been a solid choice for my office needs. Its dependability, bold colors, and fast ink-drying capabilities make it a favorite in my print room. Despite the occasional frustrating shipping experience, I still find myself reaching for this ream more often than not.

One of the main features that stood out in my experience is its long-lasting ink quality. The paper is lignin and acid-free, which ensures bright colors, and the ink doesn't run, even when using heavy-duty markers. Plus, it's FSC certified, so you know it's sourced responsibly. 

However, there was a slight downside. The paper can be a bit thicker than usual, which might cause some problems while printing. But overall, Astrobrights Inkjet and Laser Copy Paper is a bright and fun option for creating any kind of document or project.

## Buyer's Guide

When it comes to office paper, there are a few important features to consider to ensure you're getting the best quality for your needs. This guide will provide you with general advice and considerations to help you make an informed purchase decision. 


### Important Features

When shopping for office paper, the following features should be taken into account to ensure you're getting the right type of paper for your needs. They include paper weight, sheet size, brightness, and finish. Let's discuss each of these in more detail below. All of this should be considered when choosing the best paper for your purposes. 


### Paper Weight

The weight of office paper refers to the thickness of the paper. It is measured in pounds per ream (500 sheets). Heavier weights generally provide better print quality and durability, but may be more expensive. Common paper weights for office use range from 20 pounds to 50 pounds. The weight you choose will depend on your specific needs, such as inkjet or laser printing, as well as your budget. 


### Sheet Size

Office paper comes in a variety of sheet sizes to accommodate different printing devices and users' preferences. Common sheet sizes include 8.5 x 11 inches, 11 x 17 inches, and A4 (210 x 297 mm). Make sure to choose a suitable sheet size for your printer and ensure it's compatible for your specific needs. 


### Brightness

Brightness is a measure of the whiteness of the paper. It is typically expressed as a percentage, with higher percentages indicating brighter papers. Bright paper can improve print quality, readability, and appearance. However, it may be more expensive than less bright paper. Consider your budget and the importance of brightness when making your selection. 


## FAQ


### What types of office paper are available?

Many types of office paper are available in today's market. These include reams of standard paper for printers and copiers, letterhead paper, envelopes, and even specialty paper like certified security paper, photo paper, and watermarked paper for presentations. Some paper manufacturers also offer recycled and eco-friendly options to cater to environmentally conscious customers. 

Paper weight and size are other important factors to consider when choosing office paper. Standard paper sizes range from A4 to A1, and paper weights can vary from 20 lbs (8.2 g/m2) all the way up to 100 lbs (45.4 g/m2) or even heavier for specific uses like cardstock and presentation paper. It's essential to choose the right paper type for your office's needs, considering factors such as usage frequency, printing purpose, and budget. 


### What are the advantages of recycled office paper?

Recycled office paper offers several benefits for both businesses and the environment. First and foremost, it helps to reduce the carbon footprint by minimizing the need for deforestation and conserving natural resources. Recycling also saves energy, as manufacturing recycled paper requires less energy compared to producing new paper from virgin materials. Additionally, recycled office paper can help businesses meet sustainability goals and improve their public image. However, it's essential to ensure the recycled paper meets quality standards and is suitable for specific use cases, such as printing or presentation materials. 

Although recycled paper may be slightly more expensive than virgin paper, the long-term benefits for the environment and the opportunity to demonstrate a commitment to sustainability make the investment worthwhile. Many office supply retailers and paper manufacturers offer a range of recycled paper options, making it easier than ever for businesses to incorporate eco-friendly practices into their daily operations. 


### Are there any eco-friendly office paper options?

Yes, there are various eco-friendly office paper options available in the market. Besides recycled paper, some manufacturers produce paper made from bamboo or other fast-growing and renewable resources. These alternative sources are often more sustainable and require fewer chemicals for processing, making them a greener choice compared to traditional office paper. Some companies also offer paper products that are FSC certified, meaning they come from responsibly managed forests. 

Another eco-friendly option is to opt for reusable paper. Reusable paper sheets or folders can be used multiple times, significantly reducing the amount of paper wasted in an office. While the initial investment may be higher, it can lead to long-term cost savings and a smaller environmental impact. It's essential to ensure that any eco-friendly paper products meet your office's requirements in terms of quality, durability, and suitability for specific printing or writing tasks. 


### What is the difference between acid-free and neutral pH paper?

Acid-free and neutral pH paper are both designed to resist yellowing and discoloration, which can commonly occur in paper over time due to exposure to air and chemicals. However, there are differences between the two types of paper and their suitability for certain applications. Neutral pH paper, as the name suggests, has a pH level of 7, which is considered neutral. It is resistant to yellowing and discoloration but may not be as effective in preserving content as acid-free paper. 

Acid-free paper, on the other hand, has a pH level of 7.5 or higher, which makes it more effective at preserving content. Acid-free paper is ideal for long-term storage of documents, especially those that are important or irreplaceable, such as historical records, legal documents, or personal memorabilia. While neutral pH paper may be sufficient for everyday office use, acid-free paper is the better choice for archival purposes and items that need to maintain their appearance and content for an extended period. 


### What is the difference between thermal and laser printer paper?

The primary difference between thermal and laser printer paper lies in the technology used to print on the paper. Laser printers use a dry-toner process, where laser beams fuse tiny bits of toner to the paper, while thermal printers use heat to activate a special coating on the paper, producing an image. Thermal printers are typically smaller, portable, and more energy efficient compared to laser printers, making them suitable for situations where size, weight, or energy consumption is a concern. 

In terms of paper choice, thermal printer paper is generally coated with a special substance that absorbs heat and creates an image, while laser printer paper is not. Thermal printer paper is typically more expensive than laser printer paper due to the unique coating required to make it compatible with thermal printing technology. Additionally, thermal printer paper may not be as durable or resistant to ink smudging as laser printer paper, which is why it's often not recommended for high-resolution printing or long-term storage of documents. 


### What is the most suitable office paper size?

The most suitable office paper size depends on the specific needs and requirements of your office. Generally, the A4 size (210 x 297 mm) is a versatile and popular size for office printing and document storage. This size is widely used in most countries and is compatible with the majority of printers and copiers on the market. A4 paper is also suitable for use with many common office software applications, such as Microsoft Word. 

However, some offices might require larger sizes like A3 (297 x 420 mm) or even A2 (420 x 594 mm) for certain applications, such as presenting large reports or documents, or creating posters and banners. In other cases, it may be necessary to use smaller sizes like A5 (148 x 210 mm) for compact reports or personal letters. Ultimately, the choice of office paper size will depend on your office's specific needs, available printing equipment, and the types of documents you typically handle.
