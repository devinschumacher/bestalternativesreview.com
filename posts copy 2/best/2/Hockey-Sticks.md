### [Sher-Wood T20 Senior ABS Hockey Stick](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Hockey+Sticks?utm\_term=sher-wood-t20-senior-abs-hockey-stick)

Recently, I picked up a Sher-Wood T20 ABS Senior Hockey Stick Original to spice up my regular hockey equipment. Being a recreational player, I was in search of a hockey stick that was not too expensive and could withstand various playing surfaces. 

The first thing I noticed about this stick was its multi-layer birch lamination responsive shaft. It made the stick lightweight and responsive during gameplay, which was a significant positive for someone like me who's not looking for a heavy stick. The smooth gloss grip finish also added to the overall comfort while handling the stick. 

However, the ABS construction for the blade was quite impressive. It provided a decent balance of power and accuracy during shots, especially when playing on different surfaces. This feature truly stood out, and I can now play on both concrete and sports court with equal ease. 

Although the stick is designed for recreational level players, it was a bit challenging to handle during intense gameplay. The kick point felt a bit too mid for my liking, and I often found it difficult to make quick, sharp shots. The standard shaft taper and straight sidewalls also made the stick feel a bit stiffer than some of the high-end options. 

Overall, I believe this Sher-Wood T20 ABS Senior Hockey Stick Original is a good value for the price. It's perfect for beginners and casual players looking for a durable and versatile stick without breaking the bank. While it may not be ideal for more experienced players, it's still a solid choice for those who don't want to invest in an expensive, high-end hockey stick.

## Buyer's Guide

Hockey has been an exciting sport for decades, with sticks being one of the essential tools for any hockey player. When looking for the perfect hockey stick, there are several factors to consider to ensure the right fit, comfort, and performance. This buyer's guide will provide valuable insights on the essential features, considerations, and advice to help you make the best choice for your game. 


### Materials

Hockey sticks come in different materials, each with its own pros and cons. The primary materials used for hockey sticks are aluminum, composite, and wood. Aluminum sticks are lightweight and durable, making them a popular choice for beginners. Composite sticks are a mix of carbon fiber, fiberglass, and often a polymer resin that provides strength, flexibility, and durability. Wooden sticks have been the traditional choice for many years, with the most popular wood being maple. They offer a classic look and feel, but they may not be as strong and lightweight as other materials. 


### Flex

The flex of a hockey stick refers to its stiffness or flexibility when shooting or passing the puck. Flex is measured in pounds, and the lower the flex, the stiffer the stick. A higher flex stick is more flexible, which can result in faster shots. When choosing a hockey stick, consider your playing style, skill level, and personal preference. Beginners may prefer a stick with a lower flex rating for better control, while experienced players might opt for a higher flex for increased power. 


### Shape and Grip

The shape and grip of a hockey stick can significantly impact your comfort and control while playing. There are various shapes to choose from, such as a curved or straight shaft, and paddle sizes. A curved shaft helps with wrist-shot control and maneuverability, while a straight shaft offers better grip and more stability for slapshot. As for grips, there are different options like cork, rubber, or foam that vary in texture, comfort, and durability. Consider your playing style and preferences when choosing a grip that will provide the best comfort and handling for your stick. 


### Length and Weight

The length and weight of a hockey stick affect its performance and ease of use. The standard length for a hockey stick is typically between 38 and 44 inches, and players should choose a length that allows them to reach the ice with minimal effort. For weight, players should consider their level of skill, strength, and playing position. A lighter stick is generally easier to handle and more suitable for beginners, while a heavier stick with more weight distribution can provide better control and accuracy for more experienced players. 


## FAQ


### What are the different types of hockey sticks available in the market?

There are several types of hockey sticks including composite, wood, and alloy sticks. Each type has its own unique features and benefits. Composite sticks are made from different materials like carbon fiber, fiberglass, and even wood, and are designed to provide maximum strength, speed, and stability. Wood sticks are made from traditional wood, such as ash or maple, and tend to be more affordable but offer less durability and performance compared to composite sticks. Alloy sticks are made from a combination of metals, like aluminum and steel, and are known for their affordability, lightweight, and durability. 

It's essential to consider factors such as budget, skill level, and personal preferences when choosing the right type of hockey stick for you. If you're a beginner or looking for an affordable option, a wood or alloy stick could be a good choice. However, if you're more experienced and want the best performance, a composite stick would be the ideal choice. 


### How can I choose the right size of hockey stick?

The size of a hockey stick is generally determined by the player's height, skill level, and personal preferences. A rule of thumb is to choose a stick that is between 1-2 inches shorter than your height. This allows you to have proper control over the stick and maintain an optimal reach for playing the game. Additionally, consider your playing style and position on the ice. For example, defensemen may prefer a longer stick for better reach, while forwards might prefer a shorter stick for better control in tight spaces. 

It's also important to consult your coach or a sports equipment expert, who can help guide you in choosing the right size and style of hockey stick based on your individual needs and playing style. They can help ensure you get a stick that feels comfortable and optimizes your performance on the ice. 


### Can I use a hockey stick for other sports or activities?

Hockey sticks are designed specifically for the sport of ice hockey and may not be suitable for other sports or activities. However, some hockey sticks with a wider blade and flexible shaft may work for other activities like floor hockey or ball hockey. It's essential to choose a stick specifically designed for the activity you plan to use it for, as it will provide the optimal performance and safety in that specific setting. 

If you're looking to use a hockey stick for other purposes like gardening or construction, it's best to avoid using a hockey stick for these tasks. They're not designed to withstand the force and weight requirements of these activities, and could break easily, leading to potential injury or damage to the stick. 


### What should I consider when buying a hockey stick?

When purchasing a hockey stick, consider factors such as your skill level, playing style, budget, and the type of game you'll be playing. For beginners, it's essential to choose a stick that's easy to handle and affordable. As your skills progress, you might want to invest in a higher-quality composite stick that provides better performance on the ice. 

Additionally, consider the blade width, shaft material, and length of the stick you're interested in purchasing. Blade width can affect the ability to control the puck, while shaft material impacts the weight and feel of the stick. Make sure you also check the warranty and return policy of the product before making your purchase. 


### How often should I replace my hockey stick?

The lifespan of a hockey stick depends on factors such as usage, care, and the quality of the stick. On average, a hockey stick can last between 100-200 hours of play before it starts to show signs of wear and tear, such as warping, cracking, or losing its performance. If you notice any of these issues, it might be time to consider replacing your hockey stick. 

It's essential to maintain and properly care for your hockey stick to extend its lifespan. This includes cleaning your stick after use, storing it in a dry place, and avoiding subjecting it to excessive heat or cold weather conditions. With proper care, your hockey stick can provide you with reliable performance and last for a significant period of time. 


### Are there any safety concerns when using a hockey stick?

Yes, there are some safety concerns to consider when using a hockey stick. Always ensure that the stick is in good condition before using it, and avoid using a damaged or bent stick, as it can cause accidents and injuries during play. It's also important to use appropriate safety gear, such as a helmet, gloves, and shin pads, to protect yourself from potential injuries. 

When playing with other people, always follow the rules of the game and ensure that you're aware of your surroundings. Make sure you have sufficient space to play without causing harm to yourself or others, and always be mindful of your teammates and opponents on the ice. By following these guidelines, you can minimize the risk of accidents and injuries while enjoying the sport of ice hockey with a safe and high-quality hockey stick.
