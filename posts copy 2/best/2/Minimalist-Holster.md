<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Minimalist+Holster?utm_term=mission-first-tactical-minimalist-holster-for-taurus-g3-and-model-pt111-g2"><img alt="mission-first-tactical-mft-minimalist-hlstr-for-pt111-g2-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mission-first-tactical-mft-minimalist-hlstr-for-pt111-g2-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Mission First Tactical MFT Minimalist holster is a low-profile option, designed for Inside the Waistband (IWB) carry in Appendix position or 5:00 o'clock. The holster has an appealing form factor that conceals a weapon, while still allowing for fast access and draw. It's an ambidextrous design, making it suitable for both right and left-handed users, with an adjustable 1.5-inch belt clip that can be adjusted from 0 to 20 degrees. Additionally, the holster works with various Trijicon or Vortex red dot sights, which can be clipped in and used without the need for changing the sight. 

The holster is handmade using Superior. 08 Boltaron material, which offers increased comfort for all-day carrying. It's also designed using laser CAD technology for a perfect fit for each model of firearm. Users can choose to use the provided claw or a static-line tether to keep the trigger secure while using the firearm inside a nightstand safe, purse, briefcase, or vehicle console. 

I've had the opportunity to use this holster in my daily carry routine, and one of the features that stood out most positively was its slim profile. The holster is a great option for those who prefer a low-profile concealed carry solution, and it's also a good choice for those who don't want to draw attention to their weapon. The minimalist design works particularly well for those with a more active lifestyle, as it conceals the firearm and allows for fast access and draw when needed, ensuring comfort and security. 

One area where the holster could use improvement is its draw speed. It's not as quick as a full-size holster, so it's essential to keep that in mind when choosing this option. Additionally, the belt clip could be sturdier, as some users have experienced the clip bending and nearly breaking when drawing their handgun quickly. Overall, the Mission First Tactical MFT Minimalist holster is a decent choice for those who prefer a low-profile concealed carry solution, but it might not be the ideal option for those who prioritize a fast draw time.

## Buyer's Guide

Minimalist holsters have gained popularity amongst gun owners for their simplicity, concealability, and functionality. These holsters offer a lightweight and sleek alternative to traditional leather or nylon holsters. When choosing a minimalist holster, consider the following factors to ensure you get the best product for your needs. 


### Holster Material

Minimalist holsters are typically made from lightweight materials such as Kydex or nylon. Kydex holsters are known for their durability, retention, and smooth drawing action. Nylon holsters are more flexible and can be more comfortable to wear but may not offer the same level of retention as Kydex. Consider your personal preference and the specific requirements of your firearm when selecting the material for your holster.

### Retention and Carry Options

One of the main advantages of minimalist holsters is their ability to securely hold your firearm while remaining concealed under clothing. Some minimalist holsters feature adjustable tension screws that allow you to customize the retention level. Other options include passive retention systems, which rely on the shape of the holster to hold the firearm in place, and active retention systems, which use a locking mechanism to secure the firearm. Consider which retention system best suits your needs and personal preferences. 


### Comfort and Wearability

As you'll be wearing your minimalist holster for extended periods, comfort is an important consideration. Look for holsters with molded or padded areas for increased comfort around your waistline. Additionally, consider the overall weight of the holster and whether it distributes weight evenly. A well-designed minimalist holster should be lightweight and not interfere with your daily activities.

### Maintenance and Durability

Minimalist holsters are often made from materials that require little to no maintenance. However, it's still essential to clean and care for your holster to maintain its performance and longevity. Look for holsters with features that make cleaning and maintenance easy, such as removable liners or ventilation channels. Additionally, examine the build quality and craftsmanship of the holster to ensure it can withstand the rigors of daily use.

### What is a minimalist holster?

A minimalist holster is a type of holster designed to provide a slim and sleek carry solution for firearms. Unlike traditional holsters that may have multiple clip points, pockets, or other features, minimalist holsters focus on providing a basic yet functional carry method with a minimalist approach. 

Minimalist holsters typically feature a minimalist design, with little to no excess material, to ensure a snug and secure hold of the firearm while being discreet and comfortable to wear. They are popular among concealed carry enthusiasts who value simplicity and functionality in their gear. Some popular minimalist holster options include the Alien Gear Holsters Cloak Tuck 3.0 IWB Holster, the Blade-Tech Klipt Holster, and the BlackHawk Serpa Autolock Self-Retention Holster. 


### Why choose a minimalist holster?

Choosing a minimalist holster can offer several advantages for concealed carriers. First and foremost, the streamlined design of these holsters allows for a discreet carry, which can be crucial in situations where the element of surprise is important. A minimalist holster's low profile can be an advantage in many different scenarios, from daily life to more sensitive environments such as public spaces, airplanes, or workplaces. 

Second, minimalist holsters tend to be more comfortable to wear compared to traditional holsters. Their slim profile can be easier to conceal under clothing and reduces the risk of snagging or catching on objects. This can be particularly important for those who spend long hours carrying a firearm or engage in physical activities while carrying.

Yes, there are various types of minimalist holsters available on the market, including inside-the-waistband (IWB), outside-the-waistband (OWB), and paddle holsters. While each type may have slightly different carrying styles, they all share the common goal of providing a minimalist approach to firearm carry. 

IWB holsters are designed to be worn inside the user's pants or waistband, providing a concealed carry option. Paddle holsters are attached to the user's waist using a paddle and clips, allowing for easy on and off. OWB holsters are worn outside the user's waistband, providing quicker access to the firearm. Popular brands offering minimalist holsters include Alien Gear Holsters, Blade-Tech, and BlackHawk. 


### How do I choose the right minimalist holster?

When choosing a minimalist holster, consider the following factors to ensure the correct fit and function for your specific needs and preferences: 
1. Gun size and model: Make sure the holster you choose is compatible with your firearm's size and model. Check the manufacturer's specifications or reach out to their customer support team if you are unsure. 

2. Carry style: Determine which carry style best suits your needs. Inside-the-waistband (IWB) holsters, outside-the-waistband (OWB) holsters, and paddle holsters all have their own unique advantages, so choose the one that aligns with your desired level of concealment, accessibility, and ease of use.
