Overall, the L'Oreal Paris Ever Pure Purple shampoo and conditioner are a worthwhile investment for those seeking to revive and maintain the vibrancy of their colored hair. 


### [Revitalizing Barcelona Pulp Riot Toning Shampoo](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Toning+Shampoo?utm\_term=revitalizing-barcelona-pulp-riot-toning-shampoo)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Toning+Shampoo?utm_term=revitalizing-barcelona-pulp-riot-toning-shampoo"><img alt="barcelona-pulp-riot-toning-shampoo-10-oz-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/barcelona-pulp-riot-toning-shampoo-10-oz-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Aveda Blonde Revival Purple Toning Shampoo for Radiant Blonde Hair](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Toning+Shampoo?utm\_term=aveda-blonde-revival-purple-toning-shampoo-for-radiant-blonde-hair)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Toning+Shampoo?utm_term=aveda-blonde-revival-purple-toning-shampoo-for-radiant-blonde-hair"><img alt="aveda-blonde-revival-purple-toning-shampoo-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/aveda-blonde-revival-purple-toning-shampoo-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

While I was searching for a new hair care solution to prevent my blonde hair from turning brassy, I stumbled upon Aveda's Blonde Revival Purple Toning Shampoo and conditioner. My first encounter with the product was a bit underwhelming. The instructions on the shampoo bottle are misleading, but I gave it a try anyway. 

One of the highlights I noticed was the scent—it was a fresh, pleasant fragrance that lingered for a while. However, the shampoo itself was too gentle, leaving my hair feeling more oily than clean. I found it difficult to work the product into a lather, unlike traditional shampoos, which I felt took away from the cleansing experience. 

In terms of the toning aspect, I was not overly impressed. While the purple hue of the shampoo did add a slight coolness to my hair, it did not help much in neutralizing brassy tones. As a result, my hair was left with a subtle bluish cast, something I was not expecting. I wasn't able to detect a notable difference in the texture of my hair, either—it was neither noticeably softer nor smoother. 

Despite the fact that Aveda's Blonde Revival Purple Toning Shampoo contains natural ingredients, I had higher expectations from this product. I had previously used a similar toning shampoo from another brand and found it to be much more effective in removing brassy tones and leaving my hair feeling refreshed. 

In conclusion, while the Aveda Blonde Revival Purple Toning Shampoo did have some pleasant aspects to it, I was not completely satisfied with its performance. If you have blonde or gray hair and prefer a gentle, natural approach to hair care, this might be a good option to try. However, if you need a shampoo that effectively neutralizes brassy tones and leaves your hair feeling clean and renewed, you might want to consider a different product.

The product has been praised for its pleasant scent, moisturizing properties, and ability to add shine and control frizz. Users appreciate that it doesn't weigh down their hair, allowing for better manageability and a more natural look. However, some customers have reported that the shampoo may leave a residue and not be as effective at toning as expected. Additionally, a few reviewers noted that their hair didn't look as gray as promised, with one even suggesting that the product may have actually made their hair appear more blonde. 

In conclusion, the Go Gray Purple Toning Shampoo and Conditioner Duo presents a unique solution for those seeking to enhance and maintain their silver or gray hair color with added shine and hydration.

First things first, the invigorating scent was surprisingly pleasant. I felt like I was at a spa, minus the head massage. The lather was rich and easy to spread all over my hair, and it felt like it was really penetrating deep into my strands. 

But let's talk about the main highlight - the color-enhancing formula. It works like magic, banishing any brassiness and helping bring out the best in my blonde hair. My hair felt soft, moisturized, and it had an amazing shine to it that I've never experienced before. 

I even managed to skip the conditioner half the time with this shampoo. It didn't leave my hair feeling dry or heavy, which I loved because it saved me some time in the morning. 

The only downside I could find was that it's a bit strenous to comb out. But hey, you've got to pay some to get some, right? 

Overall, I'd definitely recommend this Paul Mitchell Platinum Blonde Shampoo to anyone looking for a boost in their blonde hair. It's a total game-changer in the world of purple shampoos.

I gave Joico's Color Balance Blue Shampoo a shot after hearing rave reviews from friends who had naturally dark-brunette hair. I wanted to see if it could correct my overly warm, orange tones as well. First off, the shampoo has a unique blue hue to it, which made me apprehensive at first. However, once I started using it, I realized that it was quite gentle on my hair and left it feeling clean. 

One of the features that stood out for me was its ability to neutralize those unwanted orange tones. My hair started looking more balanced and not so harshly bright. It even helped to boost shine in my hair, and I noticed a decrease in static as well. The Multi-Spectrum Defense Complex worked wonders in protecting my color from fading, and the Bio-Advanced Peptide Complex really delivered on providing root-to-tip repair, protecting, and adding a pleasant shine to my hair. 

Although I was quite satisfied with my results, I did notice that it was quite drying on my hair. I had to add a moisturizing conditioner to counteract dryness and keep my hair hydrated. Overall, the Joico Color Balance Blue Shampoo has become a staple in my hair care routine, especially for those with naturally dark-brunette hair like myself seeking a boost in shine and a solution to banish those orange tones.

I recently gave the John Frieda Blue Crush Blue Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Brunettes a try, and I must say, it delivered on its promise of crushing brassy tones without the use of harsh chemicals. I was particularly drawn to its unique formulation that works specifically for brown hair, and I appreciated the natural scent while washing. 

The tri-dye blend technology also made a noticeable difference. On the downside, I found that the conditioner took a little more time to properly distribute through my hair, but after using it a few times, I began to understand how to layer it correctly. 

Overall, this set is a solid choice for those looking to maintain a beautiful cool brunette tone.

## Buyer's Guide

Choosing the right toning shampoo to suit your hair needs can be quite a challenge. Don't worry, though; we've put together this handy buyer's guide to help you navigate the world of toning shampoos. 


### Importance of Toning Shampoos

Toning shampoos are specially formulated to help color-treated hair maintain its vibrancy and shine. They work by depositing color pigments onto the hair shaft, which in turn seals the hair cuticle and prevents further color fading. By using a toning shampoo, your color-treated hair can look refreshed and revitalized for longer.

### Considerations Before Purchase

When shopping for a toning shampoo, there are several factors you should consider. First and foremost, select a shampoo that is appropriate for your hair type and color treatment. For example, if you have blonde hair that has been colored with a cool or ashy base tone, you would want to look for a toning shampoo specifically designed for blonde hair. 


### Factors Controlling The Shampoo's Color-Depositing Ability

The effectiveness of a toning shampoo is largely dependent on the pigments it contains and how well these pigments interact with your hair. The shampoo's color-depositing ability will vary depending on the specific ingredients it uses and the pigment molecules on the hair shaft. Generally, look for toning shampoos that contain vegetable- or fruit-derived pigments, as these tend to have a more gentle and natural effect on the hair.

### Sulfate and Paraben-Free Toning Shampoos

If you have sensitive hair or are concerned about the potential health risks associated with sulfates and parabens, consider choosing a toning shampoo that is free from these ingredients. Many sulfate and paraben-free toning shampoos are still effective in toning and maintaining hair color, and they are generally more gentle on the hair and scalp.

This game-changing hair care product is designed to help balance and enhance the overall color of your locks, especially if you've gone for a dye job or undergone some treatment. Its magic lies in its pigmented molecules that work wonders, refreshing and revitalizing your hair to give it a more vibrant, true-to-life shade, whether it's your natural or dyed hue.< While most toning shampoos cater to blondes and highlights, there are also options for brunettes and redheads out there!

A toning shampoo can save the day between salon visits by maintaining that salon-fresh color, extending its lifespan, or even counteracting those unwanted brassy undertones that may sneak up on you over time. But, remember, the results can vary based on the brand, ingredients, and your unique hair type. So, before you fully commit, it's always a wise idea to give it a test run first.


### Can Toning Shampoos Harm My Hair?

Fret not! Most toning shampoos are generally safe for all hair types, including those that have been chemically treated like bleached, highlighted, or even permed. However, it's essential to stick to the recommended usage instructions and choose a product specifically formulated for your hair type and color. Consult with a professional hairstylist or dermatologist if you have concerns about product safety or compatibility with your unique hair.

While toning shampoos are usually safe for all, overuse or misuse can lead to hair damage, color discoloration, or even more brassy tones. To avoid any issues, follow the instructions on the label and pair it with a color-safe conditioner and protective styling. Your hairstylist can also provide personalized advice based on your hair type and color.

### When and How Often Should I Use a Toning Shampoo?

The frequency of using a toning shampoo depends on the product, your hair type, and the results you desire. Generally, these shampoos are recommended for use once or twice a week, depending on how your color looks after a salon visit. If you notice that your hair color is fading quickly or if brassy tones start to develop between visits, you may need to use the toning shampoo more frequently. But, remember, don't overdo it as overuse can cause damage or discoloration.

Always follow the instructions on the label and consult with your hairstylist if you're unsure about the frequency. Remember, consistency is key when it comes to maintaining your hair color.


### How Long Does a Toning Shampoo Last?

The longevity of a toning shampoo can vary depending on several factors including the product, your hair type, and the frequency of use. Most toning shampoos will last for about two to four washes, depending on the intensity of the color and the condition of your hair. Some formulas may last longer, while others may need to be reapplied sooner.

To make your toning shampoo last longer, follow the instructions on the label and use a color-safe conditioner and styling products. Maintaining your hair color is a continuous process that involves regular salon visits and at-home care.

### Do Toning Shampoos Use Harsh Chemicals?

While many toning shampoos contain ingredients that could be harsh or stripping for your hair if misused, it's key to choose a gentle, color-safe toning shampoo that is formulated specifically for your hair type and color. Products with sulfate-free formulas and natural ingredients are usually safer and gentler for your hair.

Remember, following the usage instructions on the label and using color-safe conditioners and styling products will help protect your hair from damage and color fade. If you have concerns about a toning shampoo's ingredients or their potential impact on your hair, consult with a professional hairstylist or dermatologist.

There are plenty of popular toning shampoo brands out there, each with their own unique formula and benefits. Some of the most popular ones include Fanola, Joico Color Balance, Oligo Professionnel, and Schwarzkopf Essensity. These brands offer a variety of toning shampoos in different shades and formulas to cater to different hair types and colors.
