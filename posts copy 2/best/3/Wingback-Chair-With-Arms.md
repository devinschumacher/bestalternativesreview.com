The Alexyz 29.5" W Tufted Polyester Wingback Chair Lark Manor Fabric: Gray Polyester is a stylish addition to any living room or bedroom. With its classic rolled arm design featuring nailhead trim and button tufted details on the cushioned back, this armchair offers a timeless appeal.

Accommodating up to 250 lbs, this piece can blend seamlessly with a variety of design aesthetics, from classic to French country cottages. 

Assembly is a relatively simple process, with the arm chair weighing in at 47.4 lbs. However, one user mentioned difficulty attaching the side, which took multiple attempts. Another point to note is that the seat cushion may be slightly harder than expected. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, this Wingback Chair with Arms offers excellent value for money and a sophisticated appearance that will elevate any space. 


### [Comfortable Wingback Upholstered Arm Chair](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Wingback+Chair+With+Arms?utm\_term=comfortable-wingback-upholstered-arm-chair)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Wingback+Chair+With+Arms?utm_term=comfortable-wingback-upholstered-arm-chair"><img alt="rosevera-harris-velvet-upholstered-club-34-5h-barrel-wingback-tufted-button-armchair-contemporary-na-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rosevera-harris-velvet-upholstered-club-34-5h-barrel-wingback-tufted-button-armchair-contemporary-na-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

This Rosevera Harris Velvet Upholstered Club Armchair has been a game-changer in my living room. The well-built structure made from hardwood and plywood is a sight to behold, and its dark espresso finish complements any other furniture pieces in my home. I truly appreciate the easy assembly process and the fact that it only took me 15 minutes to set it up myself. 

The luxury feel of the linen/velvet polyester upholstery is simply divine, and the breathability it offers is a thoughtful touch. The metal nailhead trim running through the entire length of the chair adds a touch of elegance to its overall appearance. And let's not forget the extra thick padding on the seat back, which provides the ultimate comfort and lumbar support for any occasion. 

However, one downside I have noticed is that the chair needs to be adjusted on a level surface to maintain its balance properly. And although the armchair is comfortable, I wish the footrest ottoman version was included for an even cozier experience. 

All things considered, this Rosevera Harris Velvet Upholstered Club Armchair is an excellent addition to any living or bedroom space, providing both comfort and style.

Wingback chairs with arms come in different sizes, depending on the user's needs and the space available. Some common sizes include small, medium, and large. Small chairs are typically suitable for children or smaller spaces, while medium chairs are ideal for most adults. Large chairs, on the other hand, provide more space and support for taller individuals or those who prefer a more spacious seating experience. 

It is essential to consider the size of the room and the intended use of the chair when selecting the size. Additionally, the size of the chair can also impact the comfort level, as larger chairs may provide more support and comfort for taller individuals or those who prefer a more spacious seating experience.
