### [Kalencom Portable Travel Potty Trainer Seat (Teal)](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Travel+Potty?utm\_term=kalencom-portable-travel-potty-trainer-seat-teal)

When I first discovered this little travel potty from Kalencom, it was like finding a hidden gem! I use it all the time to make those long road trips and outdoor excursions a bit more manageable. The Potette Plus is incredibly easy to set up, and its lightweight design lets you pop it open in a matter of seconds. It's also great for those dreaded public restrooms with their scary germs, as you can fold the legs out into a potty training ring that shields your little one from any scary bacteria lurking around. 

One of the things I love most about this travel potty is that it's super easy to clean up. No messy accidents and no more trying to teach them to aim properly. Just dispose of the liner, fold the legs back in, and stash it away in the convenient carry bag. It's a great little feature that makes cleaning up a quick and simple process. 

Now, don't get me wrong, the Potette Plus isn't without its challenges. The legs tend to slide out of position pretty easily, causing potential accidents. And the liners are disposable, which can add up in the long run. But these are minor inconveniences that are easily overlooked when compared to the overall convenience this little potty offers. 

So if you're looking for a handy potty solution to make your life a little easier, look no further than the Kalencom Potette Plus. It's a game-changer that I'm happy to have in my arsenal of parenting tools.

My only minor issue was a slight wrinkle in the center of the potty chair, which seemed to occur as a result of the folding mechanism.

### How do I choose the right Travel Potty for my child?

There are several factors to consider when selecting the best Travel Potty for your child. First, consider the size and weight of the device. A lightweight and compact Travel Potty will be easier to carry and store in diaper bags or purses, making it more convenient for parents. Next, consider the capacity of the product. Some Travel Potties come with a built-in storage compartment for wipes or extra bags, while others may require separate storage. Find a product that meets your needs and preferences. 

Another important aspect to consider is the ease of use and cleaning. Look for Travel Potties with features such as flushable liners or disposable bags, as these can make cleanups quicker and more efficient. Additionally, some products come with a detachable seat that can be easily removed for cleaning. Choose a Travel Potty that is easy to use and maintain, especially for parents on-the-go. 


### Are there any safety concerns when using a Travel Potty?

As with any product, safety should be a top priority when using a Travel Potty. Most Travel Potties are designed with children in mind and prioritize safety features such as sturdy construction, non-slip surfaces, and child-safe locks. Additionally, many Travel Potties come with a carrying handle or strap for added convenience and security. 

To ensure a safe and comfortable experience for your child, read the user manual and follow the manufacturer's instructions for proper usage. Make sure the Travel Potty is stable and secure when placed on the ground and supervise your child while they use it. Never leave your child unattended with the Travel Potty, as this can pose a safety risk. With proper use and care, a Travel Potty can be a valuable addition to your potty training toolkit. 


### Can a Travel Potty be used with disposable or cloth diapers?

In general, using a Travel Potty with disposable or cloth diapers is not recommended. Disposable diapers or inserts may not be compatible with the Travel Potty's liner or storage compartment, which could result in leaks or spills. Additionally, cloth diapers can become heavy and cumbersome when soiled, making it difficult for parents to carry and manage them properly. 

Instead, it is best to use a Travel Potty for a short period of time or as a transitional tool when introducing your child to using a regular potty. This helps your child become familiar with the process and learn proper techniques without the added complications of dealing with diapers or inserts. Most manufacturers recommend using their Travel Potty in conjunction with pull-up pants or training underpants for children who are not yet ready to use a regular potty. 


### How can I properly clean and maintain a Travel Potty?

Cleaning and maintaining a Travel Potty regularly will help ensure a sanitary and efficient experience for both you and your child. Most Travel Potty products are designed with easy cleanup in mind, featuring disposable liners or bags that can be discarded after use. To clean the potty itself, simply rinse it with warm water and mild soap and let it air dry. 

If your Travel Potty comes with a separate attachable seat, make sure to clean it as well according to the manufacturer's instructions. Inspect the product for any signs of wear and tear or damage, and replace any worn-out or broken parts promptly. By following these guidelines, you can help extend the life of your Travel Potty and ensure a smoother potty training experience for your child.
