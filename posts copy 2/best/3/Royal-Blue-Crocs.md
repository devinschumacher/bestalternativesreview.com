I've been a devoted fan of Crocs for a while now, and the Classic Clogs in Bijou Blue are no exception. As someone who spends a lot of time on my feet, I appreciate the custom fit and breathability these shoes provide.

I also appreciate the lightweight, non-marking soles, which make them easy to clean and quick to dry. 

While some might argue that the aesthetic of Crocs leaves something to be desired, I think their unique look is part of their charm. And for those who appreciate a more fashionable footwear option, there are plenty of colors and styles to choose from. 

Overall, I'd highly recommend the Crocs Classic Clogs to anyone looking for a comfortable, versatile, and practical pair of shoes. The combination of comfort and style is unbeatable, and I look forward to adding more Crocs to my collection in the future.

As a huge fan of Crocs, I've been eager to try their Mineral Blue Classic Clog Shoes. I've always loved how water-friendly and breathable Crocs are, but I've never been a fan of the usual bright colors they come in. This time, I've chosen a more subtle blue shade, which is a refreshing change.

### What material is the Royal Blue Croc made of?

The Royal Blue Crocs are made of Croslite™ resin, a lightweight and comfortable material used by Crocs in many of their products. This material is known for its unique properties, such as providing excellent cushioning, air flow, and making the shoes lightweight and breathable. The Croslite™ resin is designed to be durable, easy to clean, and resistant to various weather conditions, making these shoes an excellent choice for outdoor activities and casual use. 

The Royal Blue Crocs' crocodile texture is achieved through a process called 'crocodile skin texture, ' which involves a unique laser treatment that recreates the scaly texture of actual crocodile skin. This laser-printed crocodile skin texture is not only visually appealing but also gives the shoes a unique and fashionable touch. The material is both comfortable to wear and easy to maintain, ensuring that your Royal Blue Crocs stay in great shape for a long time. 


### Are the Royal Blue Crocs suitable for every occasion?

While the Royal Blue Crocs can be versatile and suitable for various occasions, it is essential to consider the dress code and formality level of the event you intend to attend. Royal Blue Crocs are generally considered casual footwear and may not be appropriate for formal or fancy events where dress codes are strict. However, they can be a great choice for outdoor activities, travel, or casual outings. 

For more formal events, it is recommended to opt for dress shoes or other more traditional footwear options. In such cases, the Royal Blue Crocs might be considered too casual, and wearing them could risk appearing inappropriate or out of place. In contrast, for laid-back events or activities requiring comfort and convenience, the Royal Blue Crocs can be an excellent choice that meets your needs.

### How do I clean the Royal Blue Crocs?

To clean the Royal Blue Crocs, you can follow these simple steps: First, use a soft-bristled brush to thoroughly remove dirt, debris, and any loose particles from the shoes. Next, dampen a soft, non-abrasive cloth or sponge with water and gently wipe down the entire surface of the shoes, focusing on areas with stains or discoloration. 

If the stains are more stubborn, you can mildly mix some dish soap or hand soap with the water. Dampen the soft cloth or sponge once more, and gently scrub the stained areas using a circular motion. Make sure to apply minimal pressure to avoid damaging the Crocs' crocodile skin texture or Croslite™ resin. After cleaning, allow the shoes to air dry entirely before wearing them again. It is essential to avoid using harsh chemicals or cleaning products that could damage the shoes' material. 


### What size should I order for the Royal Blue Crocs?

To ensure a proper fit, it is recommended to follow the sizing charts provided by the online marketplaces or the Crocs website. Measure your feet using a ruler or measuring tape to determine your shoe size, and compare it with the size chart to find the best fit for your Royal Blue Crocs. It is essential to choose a size that provides adequate room for your feet to breathe and move without causing any discomfort or tightness. 

You can also visit a Crocs store or visit their official website, where they have a try-on tool that allows you to upload a photo of your feet to ensure the right fit. If you are in between two sizes, it is advisable to choose the larger size to avoid any pressure or discomfort on your feet. Generally speaking, Crocs have a roomy fit, and you may want to size up if you prefer a snugger fit. However, it is essential to find the perfect fit that provides both comfort and support for your feet.
