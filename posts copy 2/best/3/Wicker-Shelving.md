### [Wicker Wall Shelf by Threshold](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Wicker+Shelving?utm\_term=wicker-wall-shelf-by-threshold)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Wicker+Shelving?utm_term=wicker-wall-shelf-by-threshold"><img alt="12-x-20-wood-and-rattan-wall-shelf-natural-threshold-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/12-x-20-wood-and-rattan-wall-shelf-natural-threshold-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the opportunity to add the Rattan Wall Shelf by Threshold to my home decor. The first thing I noticed was its attractive arch-shaped design, which seamlessly blends into any space. Made of natural rattan, it has a warm and organic feel to it, and its 18-ounce weight makes it sturdy enough to hold a variety of items without tipping over. The multiple open shelves were perfect for displaying a small vase, decorative items, and books. 

However, the mounting process was something that left me a bit perplexed. The brackets and mounting screws seemed to be designed differently than the commonly used standard drywall anchors. The instructions provided were not specific on how to drill and assemble them, which made it quite a challenge to hang it securely to the wall. Due to some precision measurement techniques required, I had to make some adjustments to the bracket placement, just to get it up on the wall. 

But despite the assembly struggles, I found the overall design and build quality to be quite impressive. The quality of the rattan material was smooth and appeared high-quality, and the shelves looked sturdy enough to hold items without any damage. The open-concept design also meant that it was easy to clean the shelf and maintain it, which is crucial for items that are prone to dust build-up. 

In terms of usage, the Rattan Wall Shelf by Threshold was a great addition to my home, adding style and functionality to spaces where I needed additional storage. Although the mounting process could have been easier, the shelf was an aesthetically pleasing and practical addition that blended well with my existing decor.
