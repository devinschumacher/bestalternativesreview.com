I had the opportunity to sport these Supreme Feedback Soccer Shorts in a size 9 1/2, and let me tell you, they were quite the experience. 

What caught my eye instantly was the striking white and multicolor logo print on the front, which added a unique touch to the overall design. The rear of the shorts featured another logo print that complemented the front, making it a stylish pair to wear both on and off the soccer field. 

My favorite part of these shorts, however, was the elasticated waistband that made them incredibly comfortable to wear. No more struggling to pull them up or down - the Supreme Feedback Soccer Shorts had me covered.
