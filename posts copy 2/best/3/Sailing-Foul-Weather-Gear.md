### [Grundens Transmit Bib - High-Quality Sailing Jacket](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Sailing+Foul+Weather+Gear?utm\_term=grundens-transmit-bib-high-quality-sailing-jacket)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Sailing+Foul+Weather+Gear?utm_term=grundens-transmit-bib-high-quality-sailing-jacket"><img alt="grundens-transmit-bib-anchor-xl-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/XRNHhJkVKCwA1q8dBxfEtw/grundens-transmit-bib-anchor-xl-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Transmit BIB XL is definitely a lifesaver when it comes to sailing or going out on the water. I recently took it out for a test run during an early morning fishing trip and was impressed by how well it held up against the wind and rain. 

First and foremost, the 20K/20K waterproof and breathable material really came through. I was worried about the thickness of the material with it being so wet, but I was pleasantly surprised by how lightweight it felt. It allowed me to comfortably move around without feeling weighed down. 

The adjustable elastic suspenders, high front/low back fit were a game changer for me. It ensured a perfect fit, even with my heavier jacket tucked in underneath. The zippers at the bottom of the legs made it so much easier to get in and out while wearing my rain boots. 

Something I noticed from the start was the YKK Aquaguard Bib chest pocket zipper. This was a welcome surprise, as it kept everything secure and waterproof. However, I did feel that there could have been a second pocket on the opposite side to accommodate both right-and left-handed users more easily. 

The single cargo pocket and plier pocket were convenient but could have been a bit larger - I had a hard time fitting my larger fishing tools in there. Nevertheless, it was clear that they were designed to make our lives easier when we're on the water. 

Overall, if you're looking for protection against the elements, the Transmit BIB XL should definitely be on your list. Its durability, fit, and breathability make it a great addition to any sailor's wardrobe.

Firstly, the salopettes' elasticated waistband provided an exceptional level of comfort, allowing me to move freely without any discomfort or slipping.

One of the standout features was the abrasion-resistant seat and knees. As someone who often wears these while navigating through rocky waters or handling ropes, the added protection against wear and tear truly made a difference. The adjustable ankle closures helped keep the salopettes secure and protected against wet weather elements. 

The fully taped seams ensured a reliable waterproof seal, keeping me nice and dry throughout the trip. The high-fit design with adjustable stretch braces created a comfortable and secure fit, even when I was actively sailing. 

Despite the many positives, the salopettes were a bit noisy, as one reviewer mentioned. However, I found the noise to be a minor issue compared to the overall functionality and comfort they provided. The slight plastic lining within the salopettes made them better suited for cooler weather, which worked out well for my sailing trip. Overall, these Gill Pro Salopettes were a great choice for a comfortable and reliable sailing experience.

Now, let's talk about the sizing. I'm not exactly petite, and I found that the medium provided a perfect fit for me. The sleeves were the right length, and the hood was a great size.
