### What is the ideal size for a red table runner for a standard dining table?

For a 60-inch standard dining table, a red table runner should ideally be around 118 to 126 inches long and 18 to 24 inches wide to provide ample space for plates, glasses, serving dishes, and other tableware while maintaining a visually appealing look.

The table's shape and the number of diners should also be taken into consideration when selecting the size and style of a table runner.

### Are red table runners machine-washable?

The machine-washability of a red table runner depends on its material. Some materials, like cotton and linen, are typically machine-washable and can withstand the cleaning process without losing their color or texture. However, it is essential to follow the care instructions provided by the manufacturer, as some fabrics may be less durable or delicate and require special handling.

Materials like silk or satin-finished polyester, which typically have delicate details or complex designs, should be hand washed or dry cleaned to avoid damage. Prompt cleaning after use is also crucial to prevent stains and spills from setting.


### What designs can be found on red table runners?

Red table runners come in a wide range of designs, from solid colors to intricate patterns, embroidery, and border details. These designs cater to different styles, preferences, and themes, such as modern, traditional, rustic, or bohemian.
