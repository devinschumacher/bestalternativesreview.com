### [KitchenAid 48" Built-In Side-By-Side Refrigerator](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Refrigerator+Brands+To+Avoid?utm\_term=kitchenaid-48-built-in-side-by-side-refrigerator)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Refrigerator+Brands+To+Avoid?utm_term=kitchenaid-48-built-in-side-by-side-refrigerator"><img alt="kitchenaid-30-cu-ft-48-built-in-side-by-side-refrigerator-with-printshield-finish-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/kitchenaid-30-cu-ft-48-built-in-side-by-side-refrigerator-with-printshield-finish-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The moment you step into the modernist world of this KitchenAid 48" built-in side-by-side refrigerator, a wave of organization and chic functionality brushes over you. Its PrintShield Finish mirrors like a dream, resisting the daily tug-of-war with grubby fingers. Inside, it’s a different story altogether. Innovative storage nooks, like the under-shelf prep zone, are just what you need to keep every dish or dessert in sight and chilled. The wood-look pull-out tray is yet another surprise, perfectly nestling ingredients while keeping moisture and stains at bay. Add to that, the ExtendFresh Plus Temperature Management System that ensures the optimal temperature climate for your food. 

Yet, my experience has been a rollercoaster of sorts. A frustrating issue with the automatic icemaker that has been persistently creating giant ice blocks instead of ice cubes, not to mention the annoying ice barnacles hindering the proper functioning of the dispenser. Additionally, the water filter has been popping out as if it got a life of its own. I tried to solve these issues myself, and while I fixed a few, some remain unsolvable. 

But here's the most heart-wrenching part - after only three short years, the compressor took a sudden chill. The thought of being without a functioning fridge for a potential extended period is a pain that might turn heads away from this side by side. 

Despite these hiccups, I'd still give KitchenAid a shout-out for their design aesthetic. They have their pros and cons, but in the end, it's up to individual preferences.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Refrigerator+Brands+To+Avoid?utm_term=top-performing-frigidaire-top-freezer-refrigerator-for-ultimate-freshness-and-efficiency"><img alt="frigidaire-ffht1814ww-18-3-cu-ft-top-freezer-refrigerator-white-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/frigidaire-ffht1814ww-18-3-cu-ft-top-freezer-refrigerator-white-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

### [Whirlpool 18 cu. ft. White All Refrigerator: Top Brands to Avoid](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Refrigerator+Brands+To+Avoid?utm\_term=whirlpool-18-cu-ft-white-all-refrigerator-top-brands-to-avoid)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Refrigerator+Brands+To+Avoid?utm_term=whirlpool-18-cu-ft-white-all-refrigerator-top-brands-to-avoid"><img alt="wrr56x18fw-whirlpool-31-18-cu-ft-all-refrigerator-white-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/wrr56x18fw-whirlpool-31-18-cu-ft-all-refrigerator-white-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Last year, I bought a Whirlpool 31" all refrigerator, and it quickly became my go-to for storing all sorts of goodies in my bustling home. Its large 18 cubic feet interior offered enough room for our family, and I was thrilled with its ENERGY STAR certification. However, my experience wasn't without its issues. 

One feature I loved was the refrigerator's electronic temperature controls, which allowed me to easily choose the ideal temperatures for all kinds of foods. Additionally, the humidity-controlled crispers kept my fruits and vegetables fresh. The adjustable full-width glass shelves were a fantastic touch, making it effortless for me to rearrange items as needed. 

However, like any product, there were some downsides to my experience. Firstly, the plastic water diverter that collects water from the condenser often clogged over time, causing the refrigerator to leak onto our hardwood floors. Despite our attempts to self-repair, it seemed like a yearly issue. What's more, when we encountered cooling problems, the warranty on the part required to fix it had expired. 

I ended up investing in an extended service plan; alas, multiple repair attempts didn't resolve the issue. I eventually had to opt for a replacement. While I'm glad I didn't have to pay out-of-pocket for the repairs, I still felt the inconvenience of dealing with the issue was unnecessary. 

Overall, this Whirlpool refrigerator was a convenient addition to my home, but I couldn't help but notice a few drawbacks. The issues with the plastic water diverter and the warranty on the needed part left me disheartened. I'd recommend this fridge to others, but they should be prepared to face these challenges in the future.

### [Professional Stainless Steel Single-Door Fridge with Superior Cooling System](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Refrigerator+Brands+To+Avoid?utm\_term=professional-stainless-steel-single-door-fridge-with-superior-cooling-system)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Refrigerator+Brands+To+Avoid?utm_term=professional-stainless-steel-single-door-fridge-with-superior-cooling-system"><img alt="frigidaire-professional-19-cu-ft-single-door-refrigerator-stainless-steel-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/frigidaire-professional-19-cu-ft-single-door-refrigerator-stainless-steel-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Frigidaire Professional 19 Cu. ft. Single-Door Refrigerator with a shiny stainless steel finish, and let me tell you, it definitely makes a statement in my kitchen. The sleek design and built-in look are quite impressive, and the optional trim kit gives it a custom touch. However, I must say, the product's performance didn't quite live up to my expectations. 

One of the features that initially caught my attention was the Power Outage Assurance, which claims to keep food frozen for over two days in case of a power outage. Unfortunately, during a recent blackout, my food didn't fare so well. The refrigerator struggled to maintain a consistent temperature, and I ended up losing quite a few items. 

Another feature that I thought would be a game-changer is the EvenTemp Cooling System. It promised to reduce freezer burn by constantly circulating cold air throughout the freezer compartment. While it did a decent job at keeping my food frozen, I couldn't help but notice that the temperature fluctuated quite a bit. This resulted in some frozen food turning into a solid block of ice, making it virtually impossible to retrieve. 

On the plus side, the refrigerator looks absolutely stunning in my kitchen, and the customizable trim kit made it easy to match with the rest of the appliances. The stainless steel exterior is not only attractive but also easy to keep clean, which is always a bonus. 

In conclusion, while the Frigidaire Professional 19 Cu. ft. Single-Door Refrigerator has its advantages, such as the sleek design and optional trim kit, the inconsistent temperature and power outage performance were major disappointments. I'd recommend considering other options if you're in the market for a reliable refrigerator with a more stable cooling system.

The two clear view crisper drawers provide space for my fruits and vegetables to stay fresh, and I appreciate the six door bins for easy access to condiments, jars, and bottles. 

The two freezer drawers keep my frozen foods organized and the adjustable temperature control makes it effortless to maintain the perfect temperature for all my items. Overall, this French door fridge is an excellent addition to my kitchen and I highly recommend it.

### [Stainless-Steel Frigidaire French Door Refrigerator](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Refrigerator+Brands+To+Avoid?utm\_term=stainless-steel-frigidaire-french-door-refrigerator)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Refrigerator+Brands+To+Avoid?utm_term=stainless-steel-frigidaire-french-door-refrigerator"><img alt="frigidaire-professional-prfg2383af-23-3-cu-ft-stainless-steel-french-door-counter-depth-refrigerator-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/frigidaire-professional-prfg2383af-23-3-cu-ft-stainless-steel-french-door-counter-depth-refrigerator-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got to try the Frigidaire Professional French Door Counter-Depth Refrigerator (call it the Pro for short), and let me tell you, it exceeded my expectations! The even and consistent temperature distribution of the EvenTemp cooling system made sure my food never went cold and stale, unlike before. The spacious interior provided by the 23.3 cubic feet of storage meant I could finally keep more groceries in the fridge at once. 

One feature I absolutely loved was the PurePour Water Filter. Not only did it ensure that the water was clean and safe to drink, but it also made it taste great. Say goodbye to impure water from your well; this fridge has you covered with its incredible water filtration system. 

I also appreciated the SpaceWise organization - it helped keep my fridge looking neat and tidy. The door storage was particularly useful, holding twice the amount of stuff compared to my old fridge. And, dare I say, the matte finish on the exterior, coupled with the smudge-proof factor, made keeping the fridge clean a breeze. 

However, there were a couple of minor issues I noticed. The first was the lack of a dedicated drawer for my frozen pizza boxes, which I had grown fond of with my previous fridge. But, after a bit of brainstorming, I realized I could still use the bottom drawer for that purpose, and it was actually a better fit than my old fridge because it had more space to accommodate the boxes. 

Lastly, the size of the water container for the PurePour system was a bit small for my liking. It meant I had to refill the container more frequently than I would have liked. But, honestly, this was a small price to pay for the delicious and clean water that the fridge provided me. 

In the end, the Pro provided an effortless and enjoyable cooking and food storage experience, and I can confidently say it was worth the investment.

As I went through my day, I found myself needing to open the crisper drawer of my refrigerator. Just the other day, I was storing some fresh fruits and wanted to ensure their long-term freshness. The cream-colored doors of the refrigerator-freezer set in the corner of my kitchen were not just an eye catcher, but also a relief in terms of temperature maintenance. The automatic interior LED lamp in the refrigerator section made it quite convenient for me to locate my produce. 

The zinc alloy handles were not only rust proof but also added a touch of class to the overall look of the retro refrigerator. In addition, the multi-air flow cooling system allowed for precision cooling throughout the refrigerator. It was comforting to know that the air flow through the series of vents located on every shelf was doing its part to maintain the consistent temperature of the refrigerator. 

After all, the last thing anyone wants is to open the doors to a room-temperature refrigerator! However, despite the many features this refrigerator-freezer set had, I couldn't help but notice the occasional inconsistency in the color of the appliance. While the cream color of the outer doors was attractive, the insides of the refrigerator had a more off-white appearance, which was noticeable and not as appealing as I had hoped. 

With that said, the refrigerator-freezer set has been an overall enjoyable addition to my kitchen. I've grown attached to my retro appliance, and I can confidently say that it has made my life much easier when it came to preserving the freshness and temperature of my produce.

We will also provide general advice on how to choose a reliable brand to avoid potential problems in the future. Let's get started! 


### Important Features

When selecting a refrigerator brand, consider several key features that can affect its performance and efficiency. Some of the most important factors include energy efficiency, capacities, organizational features, and reliability.

### Energy Efficiency

Energy efficiency is one of the most critical factors when purchasing a refrigerator. Look for refrigerators that have an ENERGY STAR rating, which indicates that the model meets energy efficiency standards set by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE). A more energy-efficient refrigerator will save you money on utility bills in the long run while reducing your carbon footprint. 


### Capacity

Consider the size of your household and your storage needs when choosing a refrigerator capacity. Large families or those who frequently host guests may require a refrigerator with more cubic feet of storage. On the other hand, smaller households or those with limited space may opt for a more compact model.

An efficient refrigerator should have interior features that help you stay organized and make the most of the available space.

### What are the refrigerator brands to avoid?

Based on customer feedback and reviews, the following brands have been identified as the refrigerators to avoid: LG, Samsung, and Whirlpool. These brands have had significant consumer complaints about reliability and maintenance issues, despite their advanced features and technological advancements. 

While it's crucial to note that not all refrigerators from these brands are low-quality, the prevalence of negative reviews points to a broader issue of customer service and product standards. It is highly recommended that potential buyers research the specific models with detailed customer reviews to make a well-informed decision. 


### Why should I avoid these brands when shopping for a refrigerator?

The reasons to avoid these brands include the brands' reputation for poor customer service, frequent breakdowns, and maintenance issues. These factors lead to a high cost of ownership for customers, resulting in inconvenience and potential loss of food due to prolonged repairs or replacements of the refrigerator. 

Furthermore, the failure of these brands to provide adequate after-sales support and prompt troubleshooting has resulted in customer dissatisfaction, negative reviews, and the development of buyer's remorse. It's essential to consider these aspects when shopping for a refrigerator and weighing your options.

Haier is particularly well-known for its energy-efficient designs, GE has become synonymous with quality reliability, and Bosch excels in providing thoughtful, innovative refrigerator solutions. 

Though it's essential to research and compare specific models within these brands to ensure your selection aligns with your needs and budget, the overall reliability and after-sales support provided by these brands make them a safer choice for a smart investment in your home appliances. Remember, always read carefully and compare reviews for specific product models before making your final decision. 


### What are some key features to look for when shopping for a refrigerator?

When considering features for your next refrigerator, consider capacity, adjustable shelving, door bins, crisper drawers, an ice maker or water dispenser, freezer temperature range, and energy efficiency. Ensuring that the available features meet your household's requirements will be instrumental in selecting the perfect refrigerator for your needs. 

Additionally, it's vital to compare the dimensions of the refrigerator with the available space in your kitchen to ensure compatibility. Lastly, don't forget to consider your budget, as high-end features may come with a premium price tag. Remember, the best refrigerator for you is the one that suits your needs and fits within your budget without compromising on quality or reliability.

Additionally, always compare prices and deals offered by multiple retailers to ensure you're getting the best value for your money. Consider looking into discounts, promotions, or sales, as well as the manufacturer's warranties. 

It's also important to read customer reviews and rely on the experiences of others to make a well-informed decision. Focusing on trusted brands with a long history of reliability will help to increase the likelihood of a satisfactory and durable purchase. Remember, a refrigerator is an investment that should last for many years, so choosing a brand and model that fits your needs and budget will ultimately save you from potential costly repairs or replacements. 


### What are the advantages of avoiding popular refrigerator brands?

Contrary to popular belief, popular refrigerator brands are not always the best choice due to a variety of reasons. Some advantages of avoiding these brands include: lower price points on alternative models, better after-sales support from lesser-known brands, and reduced reliance on brand name recognition alone. 

By avoiding popular refrigerator brands, you also minimize the risk of being among the thousands of customers experiencing the same issues. Instead, you can explore lesser-known brands with fewer complaints and more satisfied customers. This option can help you save significant time and effort that might have been required to troubleshoot the reliability of a popular brand before making a purchase.
