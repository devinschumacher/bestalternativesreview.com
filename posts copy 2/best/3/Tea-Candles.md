### [White Unscented Tealight Candles: Durable, Long-Lasting, and Versatile](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Tea+Candles?utm\_term=white-unscented-tealight-candles-durable-long-lasting-and-versatile)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Tea+Candles?utm_term=white-unscented-tealight-candles-durable-long-lasting-and-versatile"><img alt="mainstays-white-unscented-indoor-outdoor-tealight-candles-50-count-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mainstays-white-unscented-indoor-outdoor-tealight-candles-50-count-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Mainstays White Unscented Indoor/Outdoor Tealight Candles have become my go-to choice for adding a warm glow to any room. The 50-candle pack provides plenty of options for decorating, whether you're lighting up a winter night or enhancing a summer outdoor gathering. The tealights fit perfectly in most tealight holders, making them versatile and easy to use. 

One feature that I especially appreciate is the long burn time. Each tealight can last up to 3-5 hours, ensuring that you won't have to keep replacing them constantly. The unscented option is a nice touch, as it allows the smell of your other candles or room fragrances to shine. 

While the packaging is secure and the candles fit snugly into their aluminum cups, I did notice that the cups can be a bit thin and may bend slightly during removal from the plastic wrap. However, this is a minor issue that doesn't detract from the overall quality of the product. 

Another downside is that the candles are not refillable, so once the wax has burned down, you'll have to replace the entire tealight. This can be costly in the long run, but for the convenience and ambiance they provide, I'm willing to make the trade-off. 

Overall, the Mainstays White Unscented Indoor/Outdoor Tealight Candles are a reliable and affordable choice for anyone looking to add a touch of warmth and coziness to their home. The long burn time, unscented scent, and ease of use make these candles a worthwhile investment.

### [12-Pack Tealight Ashwood and Palo Santo Threshold Candles](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Tea+Candles?utm\_term=12-pack-tealight-ashwood-and-palo-santo-threshold-candles)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Tea+Candles?utm_term=12-pack-tealight-ashwood-and-palo-santo-threshold-candles"><img alt="12pk-tealight-ashwood-and-palo-santo-candle-threshold-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/12pk-tealight-ashwood-and-palo-santo-candle-threshold-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried out the Threshold 12Pk Tealight Ashwood and Palo Santo Candle set, and I have to say, I'm quite impressed. This pack of tealights is perfect for daily use or special occasions, thanks to its earthy brown hue that adds a warm touch to any space. 

One of the highlights of these candles is the rich blend of scents. Ashwood and palo santo combine with notes of patchouli and oakwood to create a delightful and inviting ambiance. What I really love is that the scent is not too overpowering, but rather present in the background, making it perfect for unwinding after a long day. 

Another thing I appreciate is how long these little candles burn for. Each one lasts up to 4 hours, which is pretty impressive considering their size. It's definitely worth the money spent, especially given the lovely scent they put out. 

However, I do have to mention one downside: some users have reported that the scent isn't as strong as they would have liked. While I personally don't mind the subtlety, it is something to consider if you prefer a more powerful aroma. 

Overall, the Threshold 12Pk Tealight Ashwood and Palo Santo Candle set is a great addition to any home. Its earthy color, delightful scents, and long burn time make it a worthwhile purchase. Just be aware that the scent might not be as strong as you'd expect, but for me, the pros definitely outweigh the cons.

I've been using these Mini Tea Light Candles for some time now, and I have to say they're a game-changer. Not only are they perfect for a candle-lover, but they provide a practical solution for any situation. 

The highlight here is the compact size. These 1-inch wonders are just right for when you need a small, portable candle, whether it's for a weekend getaway or a quick dinner with friends. They fit neatly in your pocket or handbag, making them incredibly convenient for traveling or everyday usage. 

The clean, timeless design is another plus. The white unscented tea lights create an inviting atmosphere wherever you place them, whether it's as Shabbat candles or simply for decoration. The additional bow embellishment adds a touch of elegance to the overall presentation. 

However, the downside of being so small is that they only burn for an hour.

But on the brighter side, there are 50 of them in a pack, so you'll never run out of tea lights. 

Overall, these tea lights are an excellent investment for any candle enthusiast. Their petite size makes them a versatile choice for various occasions. However, the limited burn time might be a downer for some.

However, there is one downside to note - the fact that the batteries are not included. This might be a minor inconvenience for some people who weren't aware of it beforehand. Overall, I'd highly recommend this product to anyone seeking a luxurious and long-lasting scent experience.

### Fragrance and Strength

Tea candles come in a wide variety of fragrances, so it's essential to choose one that suits your taste. Some popular scents include lavender, peppermint, and chamomile. Fragrance strength is also essential, as a too-strong scent can be overwhelming. Look for tea candles with a balanced fragrance that provides a pleasant aroma without being overpowering. 


### Wax Quality

The quality of the wax used in tea candles can impact the overall performance and longevity of the candle. High-quality wax burns cleaner and provides a longer burn time, ensuring your candle lasts longer. Look for tea candles made from natural waxes, such as soy or beeswax, which are environmentally friendly and provide a cleaner burn.

### What are tea candles?

Tea candles are small, container candles made from a wax base that have a wick extending from the top. They are typically used for ambient lighting or fragrance. Unlike traditional taper candles, they do not require a holder and can be placed directly on a flat surface. There are various sizes, shapes, and scents to choose from. 

Unlike conventional candles, tea candles come in a variety of scents, providing an enhanced sensory experience in both single and multi-wick configurations. They are particularly popular during occasions like birthdays, anniversaries, and special events as they create a warm and inviting atmosphere. 


### What are the benefits of using tea candles?

Tea candles offer several benefits, including their versatility, safety, and longevity. They can be used alone or in a group to create a soothing and warm ambiance. Since they don't require a traditional, removable glass or metal outer shell like traditional candles, they are considered safer, as they do not pose the risk of causing accidental fires or burns. 

In addition, they provide a more extended burn time compared to traditional candles. Some tea candles can burn for up to 20 hours or even more, depending on the specific brand and size. They are also available in different fragrances, allowing you to choose the scent that best suits your preferences.

### Are tea candles safe to use?

Tea candles have a relatively lower fire risk compared to traditional candles. The primary reason for this is that they do not require a removable holder. As a result, they are less likely to tip over, creating a safer environment. However, they should still be used with caution, particularly around children and pets, and kept away from flammable materials. 

Furthermore, just like any candle, tea candles should never be left unattended while lit. They should also be placed on a stable, heat-resistant surface to prevent potential accidents. It is advised to extinguish the flame if you leave the room or the area where the tea candle is burning. Overall, following common-sense safety precautions will ensure a safe and enjoyable experience with tea candles. 


### What are the common sizes of tea candles?

Tea candles come in various sizes, ranging from small votive size to larger, specialty candles. The most common size is the standard tea light candle, which has a diameter of approximately 75mm (3 inches) and a height of about 15mm (0.6 inches). It provides approximately 10-12 hours of burn time and is suitable for most tea candle holders. 

Another common size is the large tea candle, often used in multi-wick configurations. These can have a diameter of around 95mm (3.8 inches) and a height of about 25mm (1 inch). They typically provide longer burn times, often up to 20 hours, depending on the specific brand. Size can greatly impact the scent throw and burn time, so it's essential to choose the right size for your needs.

### How can I prolong the life of my tea candles?

To ensure the longest possible burn time for your tea candles, follow these steps: Store your candles in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and harsh air conditioning. This will help prevent the wax from melting or cracking. Always trim the wick before lighting the candle, as a long wick can cause excessive smoke and rapid wax consumption. 

If the wax has started to accumulate around the wick, gently remove or trim away the excess wax. Avoid using water or any liquid to extinguish the flame, as this can cause the wax to splatter and create a mess. Instead, use a candle snuffer or blow out the flame. These steps will help maintain the quality of your tea candles and ensure they last as long as possible.
