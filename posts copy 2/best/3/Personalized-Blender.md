I particularly love the knob controls that allow me to easily adjust the speed and power, giving me full control of my blending. 

However, the dishwasher safe feature is a bit of a letdown. While it's great that the components are BPA free, I found that the plastic components can be quite hard to clean, especially around the blades. Additionally, the blender only has one speed setting, which limits the flexibility of its use. 

Overall, the 2 in 1 Professional Blender is a powerful and versatile appliance that has made my daily life a lot easier. With its convenient knob controls and durable stainless steel blades, it's a worthy addition to any kitchen.

### [Zwilling Enfinigy Personalized Blender - Black](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Personalized+Blender?utm\_term=zwilling-enfinigy-personalized-blender-black)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Personalized+Blender?utm_term=zwilling-enfinigy-personalized-blender-black"><img alt="zwilling-enfinigy-personal-blender-black-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/zwilling-enfinigy-personal-blender-black-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a person who's tried the Zwilling ENfinigy Personal Blender myself, I can say that it stands out from the rest. It's designed for everyday use, and it's done an excellent job in my kitchen. The blender's compact size makes it perfect for individual meal prep, while its powerful cross blade system, developed in Germany, ensures a thorough blend every time. 

One of the features that caught my attention was the hidden display when powered off. It's a small detail, but it keeps the blender looking clean and neat on my counter. The handy to-go drinking lid is another highlight, making it convenient to take my blended creations on the go. 

However, it's not all smooth sailing. While the sturdy, BPA-free Tritan jar is durable and easy to clean, I did find that the rubber seal in the base could be a bit tricky to remove for a thorough cleaning. And as with most blenders, the noise it makes during operation is not exactly quiet, but it's a trade-off I'm willing to live with for the performance it offers. 

All in all, the Zwilling ENfinigy Personal Blender has been a great addition to my kitchen routine, and I'm confident it will continue to serve me well.

The durable construction of stainless steel and plastic seems to stand up to daily use, but it does have one downside: I've found it a little difficult to clean thoroughly. The detachable cup is a nice touch, but I've had to resort to some elbow grease to get it spotless. 

Overall, the Portable Blender Mini is a fantastic addition to my kitchen arsenal. It's compact, powerful, and easy to use. Despite its minor flaws, I'm happy with my purchase and look forward to many more smoothies on the go.
