The bedtime robe instantly caught her attention with its cute illustrations of Tiana, Ariel, Belle, Jasmine, Mulan, and Rapunzel on it. It was so vibrant and eye-catching that she couldn't wait to put it on! 

One of the things I loved about this robe was its detachable belt. It was actually functional and added a touch of cuteness to the overall design. The fabric was also soft and comfortable, which was perfect for our cozy bedtime routine. However, I did notice that the robe was quite short, which might not be ideal for all children. Also, the sizing chart indicates that a size 6 could be a little too big for some, so I recommend checking the measurements before purchasing. 

In terms of care, the robe was machine washable, which made it easy to keep clean. As for its safety features, the product is flame-resistant, giving me peace of mind that my daughter would be safe while wearing it.

Firstly, the cute and playful llama design instantly caught my daughter's attention, making her excited to wear it. The soft plush material was delightful to touch, and she loved snuggling up in it after her bath. 

One of the standout features was the two big pockets on the front, providing extra coziness and storage for her toys. The hooded design was perfect for those chilly mornings, keeping her warm and comfy during her playtime in the living room. 

The belt on the sides was a practical addition, ensuring that the robe would never get lost or accidentally removed. The snap button on the neckline was a thoughtful touch, keeping the robe closed while she moved around. 

The Rising Star Llama Girls & Boys Robe proved to be a fantastic choice for my daughter. Its combination of comfort and style made it a hit in our household. I highly recommend it for kids aged 6-8 years, looking for a cozy and fun post-bath robe to embrace.
