### [Bush Furniture Fairview L-Shaped Desk with Hutch in Black](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Black+Desk+With+Hutch?utm\_term=bush-furniture-fairview-l-shaped-desk-with-hutch-in-black)

My experience with the Bush Furniture Fairview L Shaped Desk with Hutch Antique Black was a mix of positives and negatives. The style and finish of the desk were attractive, providing a modern farmhouse feel to my home office. The spacious surface allowed me to spread out with ease and the ample storage made it easy to keep papers, pens, and other essentials organized. I particularly liked the storage drawer for my laptop and the vertical closed storage area with an adjustable shelf. 

However, there were a few issues that I encountered. The instructions for assembly were not always clear and required some trial and error to correctly position the panels. The alignment of the doors on the hutch and the desk top was a challenge, with adjustment screws not quite doing the job. Additionally, the space under the hutch proved to be an inconvenience for my curved monitor, which did not fit under the shelf, forcing me to rearrange my setup. 

In summary, the Bush Furniture Fairview L Shaped Desk with Hutch Antique Black has its perks, such as a stylish design and ample storage space, but it also comes with some challenges, like confusing assembly instructions and insufficient hutch space.
