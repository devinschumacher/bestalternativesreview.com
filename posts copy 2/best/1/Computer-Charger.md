I had the chance to try out the Microsoft KVG00001 Surface Series power supply in black, and my experience with it was quite pleasant. The design matched the sleek look of my Microsoft Surface Go, making it a great choice for charging on the go. The power supply quickly recharged my device's battery, while the USB port allowed me to charge another device at the same time.

If you're someone who frequently travels with their laptop, the Targus Travel Laptop Charger is quite the lifesaver. Its slim design allows it to easily fit into your laptop bag, and its removable AC cord ensures that you can have a snug fit no matter how much space your bag can offer. It's also equipped with a multiple plug connector system, enabling it to be compatible across various laptop brands. One of the standout features of this charger is its surge protection, which protects your laptop from being caught off guard by voltage spikes. The built-in surge protection is a handy feature for those on the go, as it safeguards your laptop from getting damaged due to unexpected electricity fluctuations, even in foreign locations. However, it's important to note that this charger isn't without its drawbacks. For some users, it wasn't able to cover all laptop models, specifically Samsung in one case. Another notable drawback was that the charger doesn't cover the full output specifications; it's 46% slimmer than a standard adapter, but the voltage, watts, and amps don't quite match up with other laptop brands. Despite these limitations, the charger has proven itself to be a handy traveling companion and a reliable charger for those who often need to power up on the move. Thus, the Targus Travel Laptop Charger is a fine choice, but it's also essential to note its limitations to avoid unnecessary inconvenience while traveling. 

This charger has been a game-changer for many travelers, with positive reviews consistently praising its portability and versatility. It's been noted multiple times to fit a variety of laptop models, serving as a universal power partner for those on the go. The product has been recognized for its robust build, and some users have even commended its durability despite the demanding conditions of various travels. However, all good products have their drawbacks, and this charger is not without its own. A few users have reported the charger not being compatible with all laptop brands, particularly those from Samsung. Some have also found the tips of this charger to be prone to detachment, requiring additional caution and safety measures during usage. Nonetheless, the charger's benefits typically outweigh its challenges, earning it a well-deserved rating from users.

### [Anker Nano II 65W USB-C Fast Charger: High-Speed Superfast Charging for MacBook, iPhone, and Samsung Devices](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Computer+Charger?utm\_term=anker-nano-ii-65w-usb-c-fast-charger-high-speed-superfast-charging-for-macbook-iphone-and-samsung-devices)

One of the first things I noticed was how fast it charged my devices. I was able to charge my 2020 MacBook Air in under two hours, which was a huge improvement over my old charger. And I loved the fact that I could charge my iPhone 13 up to three times faster than with the original 5W charger. 

The downsized design of the Anker Nano II is also a big plus. Being 58% smaller than an original 61W USB-C charger, it's perfect for travel or anyone who wants to save space on their desk. Even though it's smaller, the performance is just as good, thanks to the GaN II technology used to make it more efficient. 

However, there are a couple of cons that I should mention. The first is that the charger can get quite warm when it's heavily loaded, especially when powering a laptop and charging it at the same time. It's not uncomfortable to touch, but it's definitely noticeable. The other downside is that it only has one USB-C port, so if you need to charge multiple devices at once, this charger might not be the best option.
