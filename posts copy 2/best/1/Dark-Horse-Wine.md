### Is Dark Horse wine vegan?

Most Dark Horse wines are vegan, as they do not use animal byproducts in their fermentation process. Contrary to popular belief, wine itself is vegan, as grapes do not rely on animal sources to grow. However, some wines may be clarified using animal byproducts during fermentation to remove impurities, protein, and other solids. Additionally, other products such as cheese or cream used in wine pairing recommendations may not be vegan. 

If you have specific dietary restrictions, it is recommended to reach out to the winery for clarification on the specific wine you're interested in. They can provide guidance on labeling information, if available, or confirm whether the wine was clarified using animal products. By prioritizing the needs of all consumers, Dark Horse wine strives to make their products accessible to everyone while maintaining their commitment to quality and sustainability.
