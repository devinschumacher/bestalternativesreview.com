<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Bathroom+Towel+Holders?utm_term=everlee-anthropologie-brown-bathroom-towel-holder"><img alt="everlee-towel-stand-by-anthropologie-in-brown-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/everlee-towel-stand-by-anthropologie-in-brown-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently acquired the Everlee Towel Stand from Anthropologie, and let me tell you, it's a true classic. This brass-dipped golden beauty features branch-shaped poles that mimic the grace of a tree, complete with a charming little bird hat at the side. The intricate details make it an eye-catching addition to my bathroom. 

I found it a bit too short for my long bath towels, but overall the stability of the stand was impressive. My only concern was the color, which leaned more towards bronze than the pure brass finish I was expecting. Don't get me wrong, it still looks stunning in my space. 

Overall, this Everlee Towel Stand is like the jewelry of the bathroom world, adding a touch of whimsy and charm that makes it worth the investment.

With the myriad of options available, narrowing down the ideal choice for your bathroom can be challenging. In this comprehensive guide, we will walk you through the key features, considerations, and general tips to help you find the perfect bathroom towel holder suited to your preferences and budget.


### The Material Dilemma

Selecting the perfect material for your bathroom towel holder is crucial, as it affects not only its aesthetic appeal but also its functionality. Consider the materials such as brass, steel, and ceramic, each offering their own set of benefits and drawbacks. Brass towel holders are generally budget-friendly, easy to clean, and popular for their affordability.

Steel towel holders boast a sleek, modern appearance and excellent durability. However, they may come with a higher price tag as compared to brass. On the other hand, ceramic towel holders add an air of elegance to your bathroom, but they can be more expensive than their counterparts. Make sure to weigh your preferences and budget when making a decision on materials.

### Choosing the Right Style

From traditional to contemporary and everything in between, bath towel holders come in a variety of styles. It is essential to consider the overall theme and decor of your bathroom when selecting a towel holder that complements your bathroom's look and feel. For a more understated, subtle addition, opt for a simple design that seamlessly blends into your bathroom. However, if you want to make a bold statement, a vibrant, eye-catching towel holder offers a striking focal point for your space.


### Consider the Size

Space can be at a premium in smaller bathrooms, so it is crucial to consider the size of the towel holder you plan to purchase. Measure the available space where you intend to position the towel holder and compare it to the dimensions of the towel holder you are considering. Additionally, consider the size of the towels you will be hanging, as some towel holders have individual slots for each towel.

### Mounting Options and Installation

Bathroom towel holders can be mounted on the wall, freestanding, or even on the back of your bathroom door. Wall-mounted towel holders are generally easy to install and maintain, whereas freestanding ones offer flexibility in placement. Bathroom door towel holders are an excellent space-saving alternative, particularly in smaller bathrooms. Prior to making a purchase, be sure to weigh the available installation options to ensure the towel holder you choose is well-suited to your bathroom needs.

By carefully considering these factors, you will be better equipped to find the perfect towel holder that enhances the functionality, style, and aesthetic appeal of your bathroom.

### What are the benefits of using a bathroom towel holder?

A bathroom towel holder provides a convenient and organized way to store towels, keeping them off the counter and creating a more aesthetically pleasing bathroom. It also helps maintain the dryness and cleanliness of towels by preventing them from being soaked or wrinkled on the floor or from moisture caused by humidity. 

Additionally, using a towel holder can save space in a small bathroom, as it eliminates the need for a large, unsightly towel stack that takes up counter or storage shelf space. Many towel holders are also designed to complement the overall style of a bathroom, adding a touch of elegance and sophistication to the room. 


### What materials are typically used in bathroom towel holders?

Bathroom towel holders come in a wide range of materials, each offering its own unique benefits and characteristics. Some popular materials include: stainless steel, chrome, brass, and nickel for their durability and resistance to water damage; ceramic, porcelain, and stone for their aesthetic appeal and ability to retain heat or keep towels warm; 

Wooden towel holders may also be used, particularly in more traditional or rustic bathroom styles, but they require proper sealing to prevent water damage and should be kept away from direct exposure to moisture.

### How do I choose the right size of bathroom towel holder?

When selecting a bathroom towel holder, consider the size of your towels as well as the available space in your bathroom. Most towel holders are designed to accommodate standard bath sheet-sized towels (approximately 55 x 75 inches, or 140 x 190 cm). If you prefer to use larger towels, make sure the holder is big enough to accommodate them. 

In terms of space, consider the size of your countertop, vanity, or wall space where the holder will be installed. Measure the dimensions and make sure the holder you choose is suitable. Wall-mounted towel holders typically require a few inches of clearance for proper installation and operation. It's a good idea to check the manufacturer's specifications for installation and dimensions before making your purchase. 


### What are some design options for bathroom towel holders?

Bathroom towel holders come in a variety of styles and designs to suit different preferences and bathroom decor. Some popular options include: traditional, modern, vintage, or rustic styles; and different finishes like brushed nickel, matte black, or vintage copper. Many towel holders are designed to complement a particular theme or design style, such as a farmhouse, spa, or coastal aesthetic. 

Additionally, there are dual or multi-towel holders available for larger families or those who prefer to keep multiple sets of towels close at hand. Some towel holders even feature built-in features like tissue dispensers or razor holders, making them versatile additions to your bathroom space. As with any bathroom accessory, considering the overall design of your bathroom and your personal style preferences will help you choose a towel holder that enhances the look of your space.

### How do I install a bathroom towel holder?

Installing a bathroom towel holder usually involves following the manufacturer's instructions for the specific model you have purchased. Generally, there are two common types of installation methods: wall-mounted or countertop-mounted towels holders. For wall-mounted holders, you will need to choose an appropriate location with a stud or secure surface to properly anchor the holder. You may need to use anchors or drywall screws to ensure a sturdy attachment. 

Countertop or freestanding towel holders typically have a base that can be filled with water or sand to provide stability. Ensure the base is level and filled to the appropriate capacity to prevent the holder from tipping over. Some holders may also require additional hardware, such as screws or adhesive, to securely mount them to a surface. Always refer to the manufacturer's instructions for installation and safety guidelines to ensure a proper and secure installation of your new bathroom towel holder. 


### What are some tips for maintaining my bathroom towel holder?

To keep your bathroom towel holder looking new and functioning properly, follow these general maintenance tips: periodically clean the holder, both inside and out, using a mild soap and warm water; avoid using abrasive cleaners or scrubbers that may scratch or damage the finish of the holder; wipe down the holder and towel space regularly to prevent the buildup of moisture or dirt, which can cause damage or affect the appearance of your towel. 

Additionally, consider the environmental factors in your bathroom, such as high humidity levels or the use of harsh cleaning products, and take steps to minimize their impact on your towel holder. Properly maintaining your bathroom towel holder will help extend its lifespan and ensure that it remains a functional and attractive addition to your bathroom space.
