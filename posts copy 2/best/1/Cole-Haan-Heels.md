### [Cole Haan Mylah Glitter Fabric Dress Pumps - Stylish Cole Haan Heels](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Heels?utm\_term=cole-haan-mylah-glitter-fabric-dress-pumps-stylish-cole-haan-heels)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Heels?utm_term=cole-haan-mylah-glitter-fabric-dress-pumps-stylish-cole-haan-heels"><img alt="cole-haan-mylah-glitter-fabric-dress-pumps-5-5m-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cole-haan-mylah-glitter-fabric-dress-pumps-5-5m-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When you think of Cole Haan, the name often brings to mind sleek, stylish footwear. The Cole Haan Mylah pumps I recently tested did not disappoint. Their versatile look, with a mix of metallic glitter and classic black, is both eye-catching and timeless, making them a staple for any wardrobe. The slip-on design is truly the epitome of convenience - no more bending and fumbling to slide your foot into a shoe. 

One of the standout features was the cushioned footbed, which was surprisingly comfortable even for extended wear. The arch support was also noteworthy, providing a sense of stability as I walked. The rubber sole added an element of durability to the shoe, and I appreciated its ability to handle rough pavements. However, I must note that the sizing was a bit tricky - it feels a tad small and I had to go up half a size for a comfortable fit. 

In terms of pros, the slip-on design and cushioned footbed definitely stood out as positive aspects. On the flip side, the sizing was a bit of a con. Despite these pros and cons, overall, the Cole Haan Mylah pumps were a great addition to my footwear collection, lending a touch of elegance and sophistication wherever I went. 


### [Cole Haan Mahogany Rose Heeled Sandals for Women](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Heels?utm\_term=cole-haan-mahogany-rose-heeled-sandals-for-women)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Heels?utm_term=cole-haan-mahogany-rose-heeled-sandals-for-women"><img alt="cole-haan-womens-cherie-grand-block-heeled-sandal-size-8-5-mahogany-rose-leather-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cole-haan-womens-cherie-grand-block-heeled-sandal-size-8-5-mahogany-rose-leather-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been wearing the Cole Haan Women's Cherie Grand Block Heeled Sandal in Mahogany Rose Leather for a while now, and let me tell you, it's been a journey. The leather upper is a treat to touch, but the synthetic sole can be a bit cumbersome at times. The ankle buckle closure ensures a snug fit, but the strap across the toes? It's a deal-breaker for me. 

I'm all for fashionable footwear, but I can't ignore the quality. The heel did leave me with some initial discomfort, and I would have to give it points for looking like a wood veneer. It's a sight to behold, but it's not all that practical. I appreciate the padded sock lining with Grand 360 technology, though. It made the shoe comfortable during long days on my feet. 

But the good news is, it's been a hit or miss with the reviews. Some folks were taken aback by the wood-lookin' heel, and others found the sandals perfectly comfortable, even stylish. One reviewer even praised the shoe for comfort and versatility, saying it was their go-to for the office. 

All in all, the Cole Haan Heels offer a unique blend of fashion and function, but some design choices might leave you scratching your head. If you're comfortable with the wood-lookin' heel and the odd strap, you might find these sandals just as appealing as some of the other reviewers. 


### [Cole Haan Women's Vesta Pump - Elegant Heels](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Heels?utm\_term=cole-haan-womens-vesta-pump-elegant-heels)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Heels?utm_term=cole-haan-womens-vesta-pump-elegant-heels"><img alt="cole-haan-womens-vesta-pump-45mm-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cole-haan-womens-vesta-pump-45mm-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try on the Cole Haan Women's Vesta Pump 45mm, and I have to say, I was pretty impressed. The first thing that caught my eye was the chic look of these pumps. The pointed toe and kitten heel height were perfect for a dressier occasion, and the 2-inch heel height made these shoes comfortable enough to wear for a few hours. 

One of the things that stood out to me the most was the shoe width. As someone who has trouble finding shoes that fit my wide feet, I was happy to discover that these pumps came in a B width. The slip-on closure made it easy to get my feet in and out, which was a nice bonus. 

However, there was one downside to these shoes. The leather seemed quite delicate, and I noticed it started to show wear and tear after just a few wears. In particular, I noticed some discoloration on the toe from a light rain, and the leather appeared quite scratched. While I appreciated the softer leather Cole Haan is now using, it seems like it might not be the best choice for shoes that need to withstand everyday wear and tear. 

Overall, I would say the Cole Haan Women's Vesta Pump 45mm is a stylish and comfortable option for those in search of a dressy pump. Just be prepared for a bit of care and maintenance to keep the delicate leather looking its best.

### [Cole Haan Park Red Women's Heels - Size 8.5](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Heels?utm\_term=cole-haan-park-red-womens-heels-size-8-5)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Heels?utm_term=cole-haan-park-red-womens-heels-size-8-5"><img alt="cole-haan-the-go-to-park-womens-heels-size-8-5-red-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cole-haan-the-go-to-park-womens-heels-size-8-5-red-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Cole Haan The Go-To Park Women's Heels, available in the vibrant shade of red and featuring a size of 8.5, promise to make a statement wherever you go. Crafted with a sleek slip-on design, this shoe will have you effortlessly transitioning from day to night. The leather upper adds a touch of sophistication, while the faux leather footbed ensures all-day comfort. 

The rubber outsole provides exceptional traction, taking you from the office to your favorite nightspot with ease. However, some users have reported that the shoe runs small, and the heels may start to feel loose after extended wear. Additionally, the shoe's quality might not meet expectations, with issues such as poor customer service and the sole separating from the toe area. 

Overall, this Cole Haan Pump has its perks, but be prepared for a few minor drawbacks. 


### [Cole Haan Women's Go-To Park Pump: Style and Comfort with a Leather Upper and Rubber Sole](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Heels?utm\_term=cole-haan-womens-go-to-park-pump-style-and-comfort-with-a-leather-upper-and-rubber-sole)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Heels?utm_term=cole-haan-womens-go-to-park-pump-style-and-comfort-with-a-leather-upper-and-rubber-sole"><img alt="cole-haan-womens-the-go-to-park-pump-black-leather-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cole-haan-womens-the-go-to-park-pump-black-leather-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Slide into effortless style with the Cole Haan Go To Park pump. This fashionable leather slip-on boasts comfort and durability with its rubber sole and tapered heel, making it a favorite for everyday wear. 

One of the standout features that elevated my experience was the Superfoam molded footbed. This custom-formulated EVA provided exceptional energy return and cushioning that made walking all day a breeze. However, the anatomical heel design left a little more to be desired, ultimately impacting the overall fit. 

Despite a few hiccups, the Go To Park is a reliable and stylish addition to any wardrobe, giving you an extra boost of comfort with each step.

I recently tried out the Cole Haan Women's The Go-To Pump 45mm, and I must say, it's a stylish and practical shoe. The waterproof leather and suede upper made it easy to pair with any outfit, while the Superfoam molded footbed provided a cushioned and comfortable fit. However, I did notice that the fit wasn't quite the same as other Cole Haan shoes I've owned, which left me feeling a bit disappointed. 

Overall, I enjoyed wearing the Cole Haan Women's The Go-To Pump 45mm, but I would have appreciated a better fit and a more consistent sizing experience. The shoe's waterproof feature and the Superfoam footbed definitely stand out, and I appreciated the versatility of being able to wear it both in the office and for social events. Despite the slight fit issue, I would recommend this shoe to others looking for a chic and comfortable block heel pump. 


### [Cole Haan Women's Sleek Slingback Pump 45mm](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Heels?utm\_term=cole-haan-womens-sleek-slingback-pump-45mm)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Heels?utm_term=cole-haan-womens-sleek-slingback-pump-45mm"><img alt="cole-haan-womens-the-go-to-slingback-pump-45mm-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cole-haan-womens-the-go-to-slingback-pump-45mm-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

However, some users have reported issues with the shoe's fit and comfort, mentioning that it pinches their toes, rubs their feet, and runs narrow or small. The strap is also an issue for some, as it's not adjustable, making it difficult to wear for those with different foot sizes. The leather's quality has been a concern for some users, who have found it to be sharp and not as soft as expected from Cole Haan. 

Overall, Cole Haan Women's The Go-To Slingback Pump 45mm is a fashionable and comfortable choice for those looking for a stylish, yet practical, shoe. With its classic design and innovative features, it's an excellent option for everyday wear, work, or special occasions. Just be mindful of the potential fit issues, and consider adjusting the size accordingly if you experience discomfort.

### [Cole Haan Black Suede Women's Vandam Pumps with Comfort Technology](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Heels?utm\_term=cole-haan-black-suede-womens-vandam-pumps-with-comfort-technology)

I recently decided to upgrade my wardrobe with a pair of stylish, comfortable shoes from Cole Haan Women's Vandam Pumps collection, and let me tell you, it was a great choice! I went for a pair in black suede because who doesn't love a good classic black shoe? 

From the very first moment I slipped these beauties on, I was impressed by the arch foam providing the much-needed support and by the laser forepart design that added just the right amount of traction for those long walks around the city. The 2.55" high heel was the perfect height, neither too high to topple over nor too low to feel like you're not wearing heels at all. 

What really stood out to me was the comfort they offered. I have some previous foot issues, and I'm always on the lookout for shoes that are as comfortable as they are stylish. These Cole Haans certainly did not disappoint - thanks to the generous amount of cushioning and superb flexibility, I forgot I was wearing heels, and my feet felt as if they were wrapped in a cozy blanket! 

Of course, I have to mention that, while the fit was true to size, some users found the shoes a bit snug around the toes, so if you have particularly wide feet or just want to be extra cautious about sizing, it's always a good idea to try them on in person or reach out to Cole Haan's customer service for assistance.

### [Cole Haan Raffia Block-Heel Dress Sandals for Women - Size 6M](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Heels?utm\_term=cole-haan-raffia-block-heel-dress-sandals-for-women-size-6m)

Despite the raffia fabric being a bit more delicate than expected, it looked chic and added an earthy touch to the shoe. 

However, I did find myself breaking in the shoes a bit before they felt completely comfortable. The leather felt a bit stiff, and I ended up getting a few blisters after my first few wears. But overall, I think these shoes are a great option for those looking for a stylish and comfortable dress sandal. Just remember to give them a little time to work into your foot before hitting the pavement.

Overall, I found these wedges to be an attractive and comfortable addition to my wardrobe, and I highly recommend them to others who appreciate both style and comfort. 


### [Cole Haan Chic Block Heel Sandals with Multi Leaf Print](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Heels?utm\_term=cole-haan-chic-block-heel-sandals-with-multi-leaf-print)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Cole+Haan+Heels?utm_term=cole-haan-chic-block-heel-sandals-with-multi-leaf-print"><img alt="cole-haan-calli-single-band-block-heel-sandal-40-mm-womens-shoes-multi-leaf-print-6-5-b-medium-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cole-haan-calli-single-band-block-heel-sandal-40-mm-womens-shoes-multi-leaf-print-6-5-b-medium-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently tried on the Cole Haan Calli Single Band Block Heel Sandal, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations. The unique open toe design and stacked heel made it a perfect fit for my summer wardrobe. Plus, the multi-leaf print on the straps was a delightful touch. 

As I walked around in these stylish sandals, I noticed the synthetic upper felt comfy and breathable. The lining was also synthetic, which added to the overall comfort. The heel height was spot on, providing the perfect amount of support while maintaining a chic look. 

However, there was a minor issue that I encountered - the back part of the leather top near my arch did create some discomfort when I walked for extended periods. Additionally, a few reviewers mentioned that the sandals were tight, so I would suggest trying them on before purchasing to ensure the best fit. 

Despite these minor concerns, I found myself reaching for these sandals more and more as the summer season progressed. Their versatility and eye-catching design made them a standout in my shoe collection. And, let's not forget the fantastic price! All in all, the Cole Haan Calli Single Band Block Heel Sandal earned a spot in my summer wardrobe, and I'm sure it will do the same for many others.
