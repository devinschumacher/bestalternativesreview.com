### [Cream Bell Sleeve Mini Dress by Astr The Label](https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Bell+Sleeve+Dress?utm\_term=cream-bell-sleeve-mini-dress-by-astr-the-label)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Bell+Sleeve+Dress?utm_term=cream-bell-sleeve-mini-dress-by-astr-the-label"><img alt="astr-the-label-sakari-bell-sleeve-mini-dress-cream-xs-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/astr-the-label-sakari-bell-sleeve-mini-dress-cream-xs-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Astr The Label Sakari Bell Sleeve Mini Dress is a delightful addition to my wardrobe. The bell sleeves make a statement without overwhelming, while the slightly draped boat neckline adds a touch of elegance. The tonal jacquard print is intriguing, a perfect blend of patterns and colors that caught my eye. What's more, the dress is fully lined, which is a definite plus for me, making it a great option for those slightly chilly evenings. 

However, there's a bit of a downside - the Dry Clean Only label. I do appreciate the fully lined aspect, but I would have prefered a wash-able option, especially considering the material used, which is 100% viscose. Unfortunately, it doesn't come in a size larger than XS according to the style number ACDR102212S. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, this Astr The Label Sakari Bell Sleeve Mini Dress has been a delightful addition to my wardrobe, and I'm always on the lookout for similar styles that would work well with it.

One feature that stood out was how well the dress fit - it was true to size, and the cut was flattering for most body types. However, I did notice that the sleeves could be a tad too long for those with shorter arms, so it's worth considering if you're in that category. 

Overall, I was really pleased with the dress and its quality, and I think it would make a fantastic addition to anyone's closet who's looking for a bold, stylish choice for a night out or special occasion.
