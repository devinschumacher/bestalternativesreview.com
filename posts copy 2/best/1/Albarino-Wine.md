After trying out Legado Del Fraile's Rias Baixas Albarino 2022, I was captivated by the traditional wine-making process the company follows. Their vineyards, all owned by the winery, are located in the Salnes Valley, which offers a unique terroir. The high trellising technique allows for better air flow, keeping the plants dry and healthy. 

The winemaking process is quite intricate, with grapes being pressed and macerated with their skins at cold temperatures to enhance aromatics and let native yeasts come into play. The wine is then separated from the skins and allowed to warm, initiating fermentation. Racking off the gross lees halfway through helps maintain their nutrients, aiding in the fermentation process. 

Overall, I found the 2022 Legado Del Fraile Albarino quite refreshing and aromatic. However, I noticed that the company's focus on traditional methods might result in inconsistent wine characteristics, such as malolactic fermentation, which can sometimes be desirable. Nevertheless, this wine stood out to me for its dedication to preserving the history of Albarino winemaking.

Albariño wines are gaining popularity around the world due to their food-friendly nature and unique taste profile. 


### Why is it called Albariño, and how is it pronounced?

The name Albariño comes from the Spanish word "albarín, " which translates to "white" or "light-colored. " It is pronounced as "al-ba-ree-no" – accent on the first syllable. However, some people might also pronounce it as "al-bahh-ree-noh, " with the focus on the second syllable. Although there is a slight variation in pronunciation, both versions are acceptable.

Galicia is known for its picturesque coastlines, fishing villages, and rolling green hills – making it an ideal environment for growing the Albariño grape. The cooler climate and maritime influence contribute to the grape's crisp acidity and unique flavor profile. 

Although most of the Albariño grape production is concentrated in Galicia, it can also be found in other regions of Spain, such as Rías Baixas. Galicia and Rías Baixas produce the majority of Albariño wines, while smaller amounts are also being produced in neighboring Portugal (specifically in the Vinho Verde region). Overall, Albariño grapes are not as widely grown as other popular grape varieties, but they are valued for their distinctive characteristics and the high-quality wines they produce.

Both Albariño and Sauvignon Blanc are white wine grapes that are grown in cooler climate regions and are known for their refreshing character. Both varieties often produce wines that are crisp, light-bodied, and have high acidity. These factors contribute to their refreshing and food-friendly nature. 

However, there are some key differences between them.

However, each grape variety does have its own distinct flavor profile, which gives it a distinct personality in the glass. Albariño wines, in particular, are praised for their aromatic qualities, which can remind wine enthusiasts of other grape varieties, but ultimately, the Albariño grape remains a category of its own.
