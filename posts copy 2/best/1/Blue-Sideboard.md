In my quest to revive my living space with a touch of Mid-Century modern, I came across the Tabaria Sideboard from Lifestorey. This sleek, Midnight Blue cabinet promises a unique blend of style and functionality, with ample storage space for all those essentials. Its movable interior shelves and sturdy MDF construction are intriguing, but there's more to this cabinet than meets the eye. 

Upon receiving my purchase, I was immediately struck by the cabinet's striking blue finish. The gold-toned metal handles and legs add a touch of elegance, but it was the front door panels with their grooved pattern that truly captured my attention. The piece was easy to assemble, but it didn't come without its challenges, such as ensuring all the beveled edges faced back. The instructions, while comprehensive, could have been more user-friendly. 

One of the standout features of the Tabaria Sideboard is its spacious interior, which is perfect for storing dishes, serving pieces, linens, and other items. I appreciate the movable shelves that make organization a breeze. However, despite the cabinet's robust construction, I noticed some odd odors during the assembly process, which may warrant further investigation. 

The key to enjoying this cabinet is the careful consideration of the weight it will be subjected to, especially when placing heavier items such as TVs on top. The cabinet does come with all the necessary hardware to wall-mount it, which I would highly recommend for added security and peace of mind. 

In conclusion, the Lifestorey Tabaria Sideboard offers a striking blend of style and storage capabilities, and despite some minor setbacks, I'd recommend it to anyone seeking to add a touch of Mid-Century modern to their living space. 


## Buyer's Guide

When looking to add a touch of elegance and storage to your dining room, a blue sideboard can be an excellent addition. This buyer's guide will help you understand the key features to consider, as well as general advice on purchasing a blue sideboard that suits your needs and style. 


### Materials & Construction

A good blue sideboard should be made from high-quality materials that are both durable and aesthetically pleasing. Common options include solid wood, MDF (medium-density fiberboard), and composite materials. Solid wood sideboards can be costly but provide excellent craftsmanship and longevity. MDF and composite materials are more affordable but may require regular maintenance to maintain their quality.

### Style & Design

The style and design of a blue sideboard will significantly impact its overall look and feel. Consider factors such as the shape of the piece (e. g. , rectangular, rounded, or corner), the number of doors and drawers, and the overall color scheme and finish. A more traditional blue sideboard may feature ornate carvings and a darker, richer shade of blue, while a more modern design may be sleeker with clean lines and a lighter shade of blue. 


### Storage & Functionality

Storage is a crucial consideration when purchasing a blue sideboard. Look for pieces that offer ample space for dishes, glassware, and other dining accessories. Additional features such as adjustable shelves or built-in wine racks can be beneficial for organizing your items. Pay attention to the overall dimensions and weight capacity to ensure the sideboard can accommodate your needs without compromising stability.

### Price & Budget

Blue sideboards come in a wide range of prices, so it's essential to set a budget before starting your search. Consider the materials, size, and design elements when determining how much you're willing to spend. Shop around for the best deals and be prepared to make compromises if necessary. Remember that a higher-quality, more expensive sideboard may require less maintenance and last longer than a cheaper option.

### What are the most important features of a blue sideboard?

The most important features of a blue sideboard include style, durability, storage options, and color. A stylish blue sideboard adds a touch of elegance and sophistication to any room. It should be made of high-quality materials for durability and have ample storage space, including drawers and shelves. 

Color is a significant aspect of a blue sideboard, as it can range from light, almost pastel shades to deep, rich hues. Consider how the chosen color will complement the rest of the room's decor and whether it will stand out or blend in seamlessly. A well-designed blue sideboard will serve as a functional and visually appealing focal point in your home. 


### What materials are commonly used to make blue sideboards?

Common materials used to make blue sideboards include solid woods, particleboard, veneer, and medium-density fiberboard (MDF). Solid wood sideboards are often considered the best option due to their durability, strength, and natural beauty. Some of the most popular solid woods for sideboards include oak, maple, cherry, mahogany, and walnut. 

Particleboard and veneer sideboards are more budget-friendly alternatives, but they may not offer the same level of durability or style as solid wood options. MDF sideboards offer a higher quality option than particleboard but may not have the same natural beauty as solid wood. When selecting a blue sideboard, consider your budget, desired level of durability, and the overall look you want to achieve.

### What are the different styles of blue sideboards available?

There are various styles of blue sideboards available to suit different tastes and room decors. Traditional or classic styles often feature ornate designs or carvings, as well as intricate joints and construction techniques. These sideboards are generally made of solid wood and have a more formal or opulent appearance. 

Modern blue sideboards, on the other hand, tend to have simpler designs and clean lines. They may feature minimalist or industrial elements, such as smooth, polished surfaces or metal accents. Glass-fronted or open-shelf sideboards can also be considered modern style, showcasing the contents or the surrounding environment. When shopping for a blue sideboard, consider your personal taste, the room where it will be placed, and the desired style that best compliments the rest of your furnishings. 


### How do I care for a blue sideboard to extend its lifespan?

Proper care for your blue sideboard will help extend its lifespan and maintain its beauty. First and foremost, dust and clean it regularly using a soft, dry cloth to avoid scratching the surface. Periodically wipe down the surface with a damp cloth, taking care not to soak the wood or allow it to sit wet. 

Apply a coat of furniture wax or polish to the blue sideboard once or twice a year, following the manufacturer's instructions. This will help to protect the finish and maintain its shine. Additionally, avoid placing hot items directly on the surface to prevent damage, and use coasters or mats when setting down glasses or other items that could cause scratches or stains.

### What are some space-saving blue sideboards available?

Small or compact blue sideboards can be a practical option for those with limited space. These sideboards often feature a more minimalist design with fewer drawers and shelves to allow for better organization. Some space-saving sideboards have built-in cabinets or shelving units, while others can fold away or have adjustable legs that allow them to be lowered when not in use. 

Consider your available space and the items you want to store when selecting a space-saving blue sideboard. Opt for a design with the appropriate dimensions and storage capacity to meet your needs, while still looking visually appealing in your room. Small sideboards are available in a variety of materials and styles, allowing you to find one that complements your existing decor. 


### How can I coordinate a blue sideboard with my existing home decor?

Coordinating a blue sideboard with your existing home decor can be achieved by considering color schemes, materials, and styles. First, determine the color scheme of the room in question and the other decorative elements present. Then, select a blue sideboard that complements or contrasts with these colors, depending on your desired effect. 

If you have a predominantly neutral color scheme with accents of blue, choose a sideboard that features a darker, more saturated shade of blue. Alternatively, if you have a bold blue color scheme, opt for a sideboard with a lighter or more muted blue tone. Consider the materials and styles used in your existing furniture and accessories, and choose a blue sideboard that is a good match or contrasts in an appealing way.
