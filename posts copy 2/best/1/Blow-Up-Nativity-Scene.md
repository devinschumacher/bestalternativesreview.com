<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Blow+Up+Nativity+Scene?utm_term=northlight-5-5-inflatable-lighted-blow-up-nativity-scene"><img alt="northlight-5-5-inflatable-nativity-scene-lighted-christmas-outdoor-decoration-1" height="540" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/northlight-5-5-inflatable-nativity-scene-lighted-christmas-outdoor-decoration-1/h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the pleasure of using the Northlight 5.5' inflatable nativity scene as an outdoor decoration for the holiday season. The first thing that struck me was the vibrant, life-like figures of Joseph, Mary, Baby Jesus, and the three wise men with their gifts. The warm, white lighting added to the overall charm and made it feel like a true nativity scene. 

One feature that impressed me was the self-inflating and deflating process, which was incredibly easy. All you need to do is plug it in, and the built-in air blower does the rest. The durable weatherproof nylon material did its job in protecting the decoration from the elements, making it a perfect choice for an outdoor display. 

However, there were a few drawbacks that I noticed. Despite the claims, the decoration only had three figures that were actually lit up, leaving the rest in the dark. Additionally, the air blower did not hold up well against the elements, and I had to replace it after just one season. 

Overall, the Northlight 5.5' inflatable nativity scene is a visually stunning and convenient way to decorate your outdoor space for the holidays. While there are a few minor drawbacks, the pros definitely outweigh the cons, and I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a beautiful and easy-to-use Christmas decoration.

### What materials are blow up nativity scenes made from?

Typically, blow up nativity scenes are manufactured using strong, durable materials such as PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) or vinyl. These materials are lightweight, weather-proof, and UV-resistant, making them perfect for outdoor purposes where they can withstand various weather conditions. 

Because of its inflatable structure, the decoration offers great insulation, maintaining its shape and appearance even in extreme temperatures. Additionally, PVC or vinyl is resistant to tears, punctures, and is also environmentally friendly. It is recyclable and biodegradable. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Blow+Up+Nativity+Scene"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Blow-Up-Nativity-Scene-5/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Blow-Up-Nativity-Scene-5" height="540"></a></div>


### So, how long do blow up nativity scenes typically last?

The lifespan of a blow up nativity scene depends on the production quality, frequency of use, and proper care and storage. When handled with care, and given the right maintenance, a high-quality inflatable nativity scene can serve over the years for the holiday season. The PVC or vinyl construction makes it resistant to wear and tear, tear, punctures, and UV rays. Just ensure regular inflation checks, and follow manufacturer guidelines for storage. 

But, don't overexpose the decoration to harsh weather conditions. Overuse may shorten its lifespan. When deflated, store it in a cool, dry area, away from sunlight, keeping it safe and fresh for upcoming festive seasons. 


### How can I set up a blow up nativity scene?

Setting up an inflatable nativity scene is an effortless task. Begin by clearing the area where you intend to place the décor. Carefully unfold the decoration, ensuring its material remains intact. 

Next, inflate it using a pump or a strong burst of air. Inflate it slowly, ensuring the structure remains stable. Attach any accessories or lights according to the manufacturer's instructions. Finally, secure the decoration in place with stakes or heavy objects, depending on its size and weight. Stay alert to the weather updates and, if necessary, bring it indoors to prevent any damage or destruction. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@outrun/amazon/Blow+Up+Nativity+Scene"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Blow-Up-Nativity-Scene-6/h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Blow-Up-Nativity-Scene-6" height="540"></a></div>


### Yes, blow up nativity scenes are ideal for outdoor settings!

They are created using materials like PVC or vinyl, which are perfect for outdoor scenarios due to their durability, waterproof, and UV-resistant properties. These unique features make the decoration suitable for enduring various weather conditions while maintaining its looks, even in extreme temperatures. 

However, when placing the blow up nativity scene outdoors, ensure that it's set up on a level, stable surface that drains well to avoid any water damage. Secure the decoration with stakes or weights to prevent it from being blown away by wind. Regularly monitor the weather, and if required, bring the decoration indoors to protect it from harsh conditions. 


### What's the correct procedure for storing a blow up nativity scene?

Proper storage is vital to keep your blow up nativity scene in top shape for the following festive season. When it's time to pack it away, detach any additional accessories or lights attached to it. Gently deflate the decoration and fold it evenly. Place it back in its storage bag or container for added protection. Store it in a cool, dry area, away from direct sunlight, and extreme temperatures to prevent damage. Be cautious not to stack heavy items on the storage container to prevent crushing the décor. Following these storage guidelines ensures your blow up nativity scene remains in excellent condition for its next use.
